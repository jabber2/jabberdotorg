    <p>The jabber.org service is run by a small team of volunteers. You can find us in the <a href="xmpp:jabber@conference.jabber.org?join">jabber@conference.jabber.org</a> chatroom (web access <a href="http://speeqe.com/room/jabber@conference.jabber.org/">here</a>). Here are the key folks:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Peter Saint-Andre ("stpeter" or "psa") is the person ultimately responsible for the service. Contact Peter via email or IM at stpeter@jabber.org.</p>
      <p>Kevin Smith ("Kev") helps with general systems maintenance, software installs, chatroom monitoring, and many other tasks.</p>
      <p>Matthew Wild ("MattJ") is the helpful guy you see in the support chatroom at all hours. We appreciate all his hard work on jabber.org as well as the <a href="http://prosody.im/">Prosody</a> project.</p>
      <p>Jerry Pasker is the top technical guru at <a href="http://usshc.com/">US Secure Hosting Center</a>, where jabber.org has been hosted since the beginning of time. We love Jerry.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Siegle is our go-to guy for software upgrades, data backups, and other plumbing issues. It's not glamorous work, but it's important.</p>
      <p>Edwin Mons ("intosi") helps with DNS and general systems infrastucture.</p>
      <p>Jeremie Miller ("jer") invented Jabber in 1998 and still helps out around here, especially with physical hardware in <a href='http://www.usshc.com/facility/'>the bunker</a>.</p>
