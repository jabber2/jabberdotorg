    <p>Jabber.org is the original messaging service based on <a href='https://xmpp.org/'>XMPP</a> and has been continuously offered for free since 1999.</p>

    <p><strong>15th January 2023 - service status update:</strong> Our migration went according to plan, and the service is now running again! Note that it may take a while before the service is fully accessible for some people while DNS updates take effect.</p>
    <p>Due to time constraints, our priority has been to migrate active accounts. If you had an inactive account at jabber.org, you may receive a message that your account is disabled when you attempt to log in. Please try again in a few days, and have patience while we migrate the remaining accounts to the new system.</p>
