Except that SMTP has relays but XMPP does not. So in SMTP you can
get service from some third party to relay between the IPv4-only and
IPv6-only worlds. There's no equivalent for XMPP.

If you have roaming clients that are likely to end up on 4-only and 6-only
networks then you need a dual-stack server.

&gt;<i> The more interesting problem (which Tony Finch pointed out a while back) is
</I>&gt;<i> that on a SRV lookup, you get the A/AAAA records &quot;for free&quot; in the additional

</I>
This just requires a bit of care from the server programmer. It isn't a
problem for server admins.

The other thing you need to consider on a v6-only site is how you handle
DNS. Fortunately this is quite easy: you just need an off-site dual-stack
secondary that you can point an NS record at, and another that you can
point bind's dual-stack-servers option at for handling recursive queries
to v4-only NS targets.

HUMBER THAMES DOVER: EAST OR NORTHEAST 5 TO 7, OCCASIONALLY GALE 8 IN DOVER.
MODERATE OR ROUGH. OCCASIONAL RAIN. MODERATE OR GOOD.
