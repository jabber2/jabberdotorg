Cool, we'll finally get to use the &lt;payment-required/&gt; error. :)

&gt;<i> (most providers can provide a delayed feed for a fixed fee. but why

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> what would be the best practice to allow only paid subscribers access to

</I>
In general I think you would associate someone's JabberID with your
database of paying customers. If someone attempts to subscribe to a
for-pay node but they have not paid for access to that node, you would
return a payment-required error. Probably you would use &quot;leased
subscriptions&quot; as outlined in XEP-0060 -- e.g., a subscription lasts for
1 year and then you must renew.

&gt;<i> one of the ideas we are floating currently is the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. provide a bot/component so that users can register with it. component
</I>&gt;<i> would be preferable, as most components (or gateway components provide a
</I>&gt;<i> register functionality). additionally an out-of-band registration
</I>&gt;<i> process may be provided, e.g. website.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. this component/bot would be the node owner when creating pubsub nodes
</I>&gt;<i> and can authorize subscription requests. (accessmodel = authorize
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html#accessmodels">http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html#accessmodels</A>)
</I>
I don't see why you'd need to make such a bot the node owner, but
interacting with a bot might seem more natural to end users.

&gt;<i> 3. additionally such a component/bot could send notifications when funds
</I>&gt;<i> are running low, e.g. only 5 messages left
</I>
That's the leased subscription concept. But you could certainly send
additional messages, poke the person via SMS, or whatever.

&gt;<i> 4. subscription requests to paid for content when funds are inefficient
</I>&gt;<i> will receive the payment-require error message:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html#subscriber-subscribe-error-payment">http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html#subscriber-subscribe-error-payment</A>
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> topping up your virtual pubsub wallet could be handled by:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. visit above website with your credit card
</I>&gt;<i> 2. send a premium rated sms (mxit does the same thing)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. provide some other out-of-band payment options (eletronic transfer
</I>&gt;<i> etc. this of course will hardly be real-time).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> are any other options or caveats that we should be aware of?
</I>
Not that I know of. Good luck and let us know how it goes. :)
