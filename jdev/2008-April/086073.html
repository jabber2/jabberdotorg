<PRE>One of the things that makes my life easier /is/ the gateways. I work at a pro M$ company so they are Live Messenger through and through: despite my VERY BEST efforts to convert the entire company. Being able to use MSN via Jabber has been a huge help for me, but sometimes I have to log into MSN because of the missing functionality (we really do use the complete MSN feature set).

Some people just can't convert completely.

When you have a larger user base, you get these fun things
automatically: end users will pull for these features instead of some
instance pushing them.
