This is not bad. For the Aunt Tilly user using the XMPP client it
should just work. If Aunt Tilly can do everything with all her
contacts whether or not they are on a closed network, the XMPP client
will be Ok. If she can't send a file, the client will suck. The other
way around is not that important: when the Aunt Tilly user using the
closed network client can't send a file to a contact behind a
transport, this is no problem at all for the XMPP community. This Aunt
Tilly will think the closed network client she is using sucks (e.g.
MSN Messenger) and she may start looking for something more reliable
when this happens often. Of course this will happen more often when
more of her contacts start using an XMPP client and a transport
(network effects as judo strategy).

Example discussion between 2 Aunt Tilly users. Tilly1 uses Coccinella
to connect to MSN. Tilly1 does not know Coccinella is called an XMPP
or Jabber client. Tilly1 only knows it's a tool with which she can
chat with Tilly2. Tilly2 is using Windows Live Messenger, the official
client of the closed MSN network. Tilly2 also does not know anything
about computers. Tilly2 tries to send a file to Tilly1. The transport
between the Tillies sends an unfriendly, geekly error message back to
Tilly2 that she for sure will not understand. Tilly2 chats to Tilly1
that she tried to send a file and that it did not worked. Tilly1
replies that she never had problems with sending files with her chat
tool. Tilly1 says she will try to send a file to Tilly2 to test. The
file transfer works! Hence, Tilly2 gets interested in the chat tool of
Tilly1 and asks Tilly1 how it's called and where she can get it.
Tilly2 switches to Coccinella and also will start using the MSN
transport. Now there is 1 additional user which will increase the
number of similar issues (also see
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law</A> ). More and more people on
the MSN network using the official Windows Live Messenger client will
get reliability issues with file transfers. In this way, thanks to the
MSN transport and people using it, Windows Live Messenger gets a
reputation of being unreliable. In contrast, more and more people who
switched to an XMPP client without knowing they are using an XMPP
client will be happy about their new IM software as it never has
trouble with file transfers. XMPP clients will get a better reputation
and word of mouth recommendations will do the rest.
