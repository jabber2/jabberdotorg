Really I have nothing against transports. However, my focus is on making
native XMPP technologies as powerful as possible. Personally I'd rather
support some fun project like MSN-like emoticons over XMPP than just
bridge to a closed technology. But that's just my opinion. :)

&gt;<i> Either way, the PyMSNt project idea could always be suggested over in the
</I>&gt;<i> Python GSoC stuff as well.

True.
