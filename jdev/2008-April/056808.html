<PRE>It was an *example*...

2008/4/10, Richard Dobson &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">richard at dobson-i.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was talking about webdav file transfers which will not need reverse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; engineering of the closed network file transfer protocol as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transport can simply send the webdav uri as a plain text message to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the contact on the closed IM system. This file transfer method will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; safe for protocol changes on the closed network and thus will *always*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work once it is stable. This file transfer method also will need less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources from the XMPP server on which the transport is hosted (when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the webdav server is not on the same server). So, this file transfer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; method will be more scalable than other file transfer methods that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will need to go through the transport, be converted, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  I see well I wouldnt really consider that as proper file transfer, its more
</I>&gt;<i> just sending a link to someone, also just had a look at the documentation
</I>&gt;<i> for pyMSNt and that says it already supports MSN filetransfers using SI
</I>&gt;<i> (XEP-0096,XEP-0065) so this argument is pretty much moot as its already been
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in one of the more widely used MSN transports, also it really is
</I>&gt;<i> not that difficult to implement and the reverse engineered protocol docs are
</I>&gt;<i> out there, the protocol for filetransfers on msn also doesn't change (at all
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK) for a particular version of the MSN protocol (microsoft versions
</I>&gt;<i> their protocol with official clients and servers supporting several
</I>&gt;<i> versions, when you connect you tell the server which version you wish to
</I>&gt;<i> use), I would suggest you read up on the MSN protocol to better understand
</I>&gt;<i> things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  So in conclusion its already been implemented (so not the issue you are
</I>&gt;<i> trying to make it out to be), there is no need to worry about the msn
</I>&gt;<i> protocol side suddenly changing as it simply won't unless the transport is
</I>&gt;<i> upgraded to support a newer version of the protocol in which case the
</I>&gt;<i> developer will know that they will need to make modifications to the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol handling.
</I>&gt;<i>
