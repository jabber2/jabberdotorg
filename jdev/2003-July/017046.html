<PRE>&gt;<i> we are thinking about a new protocol for inter-MUD-communication
</I>&gt;<i> based on at least the xmpp-core-protocol. a Mud provides communication
</I>&gt;<i> facilities to serveral users so we thought about integration of the
</I>&gt;<i> jabber server into the mudlib or using a external jabber server.
</I>&gt;<i> my favorite would be an external server but then the qeustion is:
</I>&gt;<i> do we need a tcp-connection for every user from mud to server 
</I>&gt;<i> or is it possible to use a single connection? in the first case
</I>&gt;<i> the jid would be <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">player_name at mud_name</A>, in the second 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">mud_name at server</A>/player_name. It it possible to use more than one 
</I>&gt;<i> jid/resource with a single tcp-conn?
</I>
The first way (<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">player_name at mud_name</A>) is probably what you want. You can
do this by writing a server component which connects to a Jabber router
and handles all packets destined for &quot;mud_name&quot;. Your component would
then map the Jabber packets into appropriate functions for your MUD (API
calls or whatever). (This method is almost exactly the same as a
&quot;transport&quot; to a foreign IM service).

If you have access to the code for your MUD, you might want to consider
having your MUD connect directly to a Jabber router, or even better,
have it implement s2s (dialback) so that it can be on the Jabber network
on its own.

Hell, you could even expand this into a complete Jabber-based interface
to the MUD (of course still allowing users to connect to the normal
telnet interface). Something like groupchat/conference/muc might be
useful here.

This is a cool idea. One of the things I did early on in my Jabber days
was look at how Jabber might be used as an interface to a Ew-too talk
server. I didn't go very far with it, but it was very similar to what
you're talking about doing.

Feel free to contact me to chat about this if you like - I'd like to see
what you come up with :)

Rob.
