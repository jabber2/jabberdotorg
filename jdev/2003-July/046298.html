<PRE>Hi there;

I talked to Frank and Colin, and got the conferencing DLL for
Win32 from them for my own personal use as well. In case anyone 
else wants it, i've put it at:

<A HREF="http://www.bradparks.com/downloads/muconf-win32.zip">http://www.bradparks.com/downloads/muconf-win32.zip</A>

Hope it helps!

Brad Parks.

Hi Frank

You are a life saver. I am currently running the Jabberd 1.4.2 win32 
distribution as found at 
<A HREF="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/downloads/JabberD-1.4.2.exe.">http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/downloads/JabberD-1.4.2.exe.</A> To be 
honest I've never built anything on the win32 platform only on Unix and 
even then that was shaky at best. I have tried all the available 
servers even the commercial ones and JabberD comes up the best (plus 
you cant beat the price)

All I want to do is to be able to run group chats (ie create a room, 
join, chat, leave room). So if you have a dll that I could use with the 
above server then that is all I need, or a similar version that I could 
install on a win32 system. I would like to avoid building anything If I 
can help it, but I'm not adverse to trying.

To recap, if you have a .dll that you think will fit my needs then 
thats great. Otherwise anything you can give me that could help me 
achieve my goal would be fantastic.

Thank you once again for answering, I really thought It was last cause 
for a moment.

Regards

Colin

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Apologies for the delay in responding.  To answer your question, yes 
</I>&gt;<i> I do know where you can get what you're looking for.  As I wrote to 
</I>&gt;<i> this newsgroup in mid-June, I've been working on cleaning up the 
</I>&gt;<i> configure and Makefile that are part of Jabberd v1.4.2 (still the 
</I>&gt;<i> current 'production quality' open-source Jabber server) so that 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabberd will compile under Cygwin as it does under other *nixes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	I'm still not 100% comfortable with what I've got, but I believe the 
</I>&gt;<i> modified files I have are clean and work as expected.  The issues, 
</I>&gt;<i> from what I can tell, lie in the interaction between modules and the 
</I>&gt;<i> latest Cygwin DLL, though I haven't verified this yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	To recap, I now have Jabberd 1.4.2, JUD v0.4, MU-Conference 
</I>&gt;<i> v0.3/v0.52, and xdb_sql v1.3 all compiling cleanly under Cygwin, 
</I>&gt;<i> INCLUDING the ability to use the --enable-ssl flag to build Jabberd 
</I>&gt;<i> with SSL support.  I also have modified the xdb_ldap Makefile, but do 
</I>&gt;<i> not have OpenLDAP installed so can't verify the build of that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issues that remain (which may not be a problem for you) are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Jabberd cannot be run with debug -D flag.  This appears to be
</I>&gt;<i>     an issue with the latest Cygwin DLL (1.3.22-1 as I write this),
</I>&gt;<i>     as running the same executable under an older DLL DOES run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  I can't figure out why, but the latest MU-Conference (v0.52)
</I>&gt;<i>     blows up the moment you try to create a conference room.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, MU-Conference v0.3 works just fine.  Groupchat works like a 
</I>&gt;<i> champ, though I haven't beaten on it really hard to verify everything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Question:  Are you simply looking for the DLL, or do you want to 
</I>&gt;<i> compile everything from source under Cygwin?  I can email you the DLL 
</I>&gt;<i> alone, or if you can hang on a few more days, I'd like to post all my 
</I>&gt;<i> findings, including a tarball with the modified files, here or 
</I>&gt;<i> wherever the JABBER dev community feels is appropriate.  That would 
</I>&gt;<i> give you everything you need to build Jabberd, complete with SSL 
</I>&gt;<i> support, and anything else you need.
