<PRE>Is there any open source proxy/gatekeeper software 
available which can solve the NAT/Firewall issues for both
sides? ( I mean, if both client is behind firewall).

Thanks,
Asif Ahsan

</I>&gt;<i>SIP has a lot of hype behind it and a number of

</I>&gt;<i>at an early stage. A large number of these early players 
</I>&gt;<i>are now looking
</I>&gt;<i>back at it and not finding it so &quot;friendly&quot;. On the telco 
</I>&gt;<i>side, there are a
</I>&gt;<i>few deployment, but not as massive as expected. And there 
</I>&gt;<i>are a large number
</I>&gt;<i>of telcos that are also looking at XMPP. Anyway telcos 
</I>&gt;<i>tend to become
</I>&gt;<i>agnostics as long as they have customers... That said it 
</I>&gt;<i>is not at all
</I>&gt;<i>difficult to convince them to look at both protocols, 
</I>&gt;<i>because XMPP is a
</I>&gt;<i>reality and some of their corporate customers are asking 
</I>&gt;<i>for it in the IM
</I>&gt;<i>space. Not to say that a number of telcos are phasing out 
</I>&gt;<i>any early
</I>&gt;<i>investments they had made in SIMPLE because it never 
</I>&gt;<i>worked or scaled as
</I>&gt;<i>expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think the above statement is not entirely correct, and 
</I>&gt;<i>probably a little
</I>&gt;<i>exaggerated. SIP and XMPP are to coexist in the telco 
</I>&gt;<i>world, that is an
</I>&gt;<i>established fact. The fact that telcos have invested 
</I>&gt;<i>heavily in SIP on the
</I>&gt;<i>voice side make them more likely to prefer SIP as the 
</I>&gt;<i>session protocol of
</I>&gt;<i>choice. But we have seen requests that are leaning the 
</I>&gt;<i>other way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The challenge is getting service developers to adopt 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Jabber as their IM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution.  Unless the app is very simple, new bells and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>whistles need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be added to the set of IM capabilities, in which case an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>open source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution shines.  Try calling Redmond or Dulles and ask 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>them to hack in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your new feature set, or better yet give you the source 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>code so you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do it yourself.  Right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is one of the challenges indeed. But the number of 
</I>&gt;<i>corporation that are
</I>&gt;<i>looking into alternate solutions to what MSFT is offering 
</I>&gt;<i>(imposing...) is
</I>&gt;<i>also growing. As usual, they will use a Trojan horse 
</I>&gt;<i>approach &quot;a la internet
</I>&gt;<i>explorer&quot; to impose their version of SIP. It's already 
</I>&gt;<i>built into office
</I>&gt;<i>2003, and they would probably not stop here. If there is 
</I>&gt;<i>a challenge there
</I>&gt;<i>are also people to tackle the challenge :)
