<PRE>&gt;<i>Its a bit of a disappointment to hear your using the FlashCom server.
</I>
If there were a better way I'd use it. I consider it a waste of time to make 
decisions based on my own likes and dislikes. If something else worked 
better I'd use it. Nothing else, evidently does.

Whether of not I continue to use the flashcom server is another story, I'm 
more interested in how to go about using jabber protocol to control a 
multimedia environment with communications technology that includes 
telephone and microphone and camera. The actual software/hardware that gets 
used is doesn't mean anything to me. The protocol that gets used is a 
different story, I'm interested in being compliant.

&gt;<i>Jabber is good enough to facilitate the functionality of voice and ip 
</I>&gt;<i>without having to embed another technology
</I>
I'm not much interested in Jabber per se, only the protocol. I don't think 
I've ever read anything serious about including audio and video in the 
jabber server, but I don't read everything.

&gt;<i>I detest having to pay license fees to the likes of Macromedia for the use 
</I>&gt;<i>of the Flashcom server (which add up)
</I>
Whereas I only want to be able to do it now. You see though, I've kept the 
actual Flashcom stuff as a module, if there turns out to be the new jabber 
video server for free I'll go there, my complete concern is how I should 
deal with discovery and feature negotiation.

&gt;<i>Think of the result, an open source system for everyone to share and use, 
</I>&gt;<i>not for big companies like Macromedia to control!
</I>
I'm not a big fan of open source, I'm not saying I'm against it though. I am 
however a big fan of open specifications. People/projects can be open source 
or not I don't care as long as they adhere to open standards, of which 
Macromedia's swf format is one.

If you take a look at my application you'll notice the features built in for 
the handicapped. When a person with little ability to move (physically 
handicapped) can control their jabber client via motion detection with 
webcams and sound detection from mics it makes little difference to them 
whether it was open source or not that made their life a little better.

I'd rather not get into that though, I'm really interested in how I can best 
go about conforming to a standard. I'm rereading the TIN docs and the other 
ones now.

Greg.
