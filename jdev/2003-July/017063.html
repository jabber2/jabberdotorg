<PRE>Hi,

I've just received an announcement that the preparations for FOSDEM 2004
has begun. FOSDEM is the Free and Open Software Developers Europe Meeting.
Their website is at <A HREF="http://fosdem.org/">http://fosdem.org/</A> .

Coming year the event will take place on 21 and 22 february 2004, again
in Brussels, Belgium.

I would love to use this event as way to promote Jabber in Europe. There
are 2 main tracks for talks/tutorials and a number of developers rooms
that have their own activities (like KDE, Mozilla, PostgreSQL, etc. last
year).

It seems the main tracks are nearly filled, so if anyone wants to do a
talk there, be quick! I think we should try to get a developers room
and do a number of presentations/tutorials/other activities.

Let me know if you are interested in this. Presence from the JSF (with
a booth maybe) would be awesome.

I have been in contact with the leading guy of the organisation already last
year, and just now, about setting up a Jabber server to be used by the
visitors. This server would then host discussion rooms, an announcement system
and maybe some other cool stuff. He is more than interested to get this
going, so I'm going to persue this. Additional ideas are welcome.

Groetjes,
