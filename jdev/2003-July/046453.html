<PRE>Greg,
Are you using the Flash communication server to do what you have 
described (video, voice etc), or are you just using flash as a 
development tool with Jabber?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> .... and that so far I too have just skim read the draft I can't 
</I>&gt;<i> really comment on how much I like it or not. My question is very 
</I>&gt;<i> practical. I have to come up with something now. I'm perfectly capable 
</I>&gt;<i> of doing it my own way so that my client can recognise when it has 
</I>&gt;<i> connected to another of its kind and then as my clients can have 
</I>&gt;<i> different features activated or not the two would need to negotiate 
</I>&gt;<i> which features they share that are compatible and therefore determine 
</I>&gt;<i> amongst other things the layout of their respective graphical 
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces. No use having a &quot;See Contact&quot; button if contact doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> have a camera, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My client, and I don't know what to call it, my &quot;inhouse&quot; name has 
</I>&gt;<i> been JabberBot, but I'm sure someone must have called their client 
</I>&gt;<i> that, so I thought of &quot;JabberMX&quot; as it is very tightly integrated with 
</I>&gt;<i> the various Macromedia MX stuff, but I see someone once said they were 
</I>&gt;<i> releasing a JabberMX so anyway, this client can coordinate up to 12 
</I>&gt;<i> cameras, 12 microphones, play mp3 streams, load graphics or flash swf 
</I>&gt;<i> files, be connected to a bot, view video, transfer documents, interact 
</I>&gt;<i> with vxml, recieve telephone communication and respond via speech 
</I>&gt;<i> synth or microphone(s).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, if the client provider (a website administrator) may have set up 
</I>&gt;<i> the configuration files so that my client has access to none of the 
</I>&gt;<i> above, or the enduser may have further modified the starting 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration to deny access to services that it is capable of but 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't wish to tell contacts how many cameras they have, or even that 
</I>&gt;<i> there is access to a camera.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For my own use it's pretty simple, I can easily transfer an array of 
</I>&gt;<i> info concerning each client's capabilities and that will take only a 
</I>&gt;<i> short period of time. My client also loads modules though, so it is 
</I>&gt;<i> quite possible that one client will ask the other to recieve a voice 
</I>&gt;<i> message and the address of the module if the recieving client doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> have the capability at this moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I figure that it all works out until I come across some client that 
</I>&gt;<i> says sure, they can play mp3's, subscribe me to the stream please, or 
</I>&gt;<i> send the url, or whatever, my client needs to let it's user know the 
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities of each contact's client so I can send a mp3 to contact1, 
</I>&gt;<i> have a video conference with contacts 2,3,4 and 5 or translate client 
</I>&gt;<i> 7 into German and so on .... which is where I'd rather be, so if it's 
</I>&gt;<i> at all possible to set things up as close to the recommended format as 
</I>&gt;<i> I can, I'd like to do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm no real expert on these protocols and JEPs, I've skimmed numerous 
</I>&gt;<i> documents in the course of coding my client, but I'm much more of a 
</I>&gt;<i> copier than anything, so I guess I'd like a little direction, it's not 
</I>&gt;<i> as if I can't rewrite code later or anything, I'm just wondering if I 
</I>&gt;<i> should just do things my own way and keep it as modular as I can so 
</I>&gt;<i> that later I can conform to protocol?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll make another attempt to look at all those documents a bit more 
</I>&gt;<i> closely and appreciate any comments as to how I should go about this. 
</I>&gt;<i> I realize that maybe that there is something I've missed, but yes, I 
</I>&gt;<i> am trying to become familiar with the protocols but no, it isn't the 
</I>&gt;<i> main thing I do so don't hit me if I'm slow.
</I>&gt;<i>
