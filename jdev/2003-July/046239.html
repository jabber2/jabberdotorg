<PRE>Hi,
there are many existing jabber projects already. maybe you can just 
base your 'modified' version on one of them.

Several of these win32 clients are non GPL like. That means you are 
allowed to make code changes (if you have a license) and then you do 
not have to make it public/opensource.

I recommend you to test the available clients (listed on jabber.org) 
out and the decide what kind of you would like. Consider that most 
clients can get adapted for your needs. Therefor you should have some 
code knowledge.

One of the available clients is my own: wxSkabber. It is c++ and 
designed to become basis for other clients (therefor it's not easy to 
use it. for jabberppl only ;)
