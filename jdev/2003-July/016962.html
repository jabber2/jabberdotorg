<PRE>&gt;<i> Soooo... What's the best way to do this?  I like it to work with JabberD
</I>&gt;<i> 1.4.2 but move over to JabberD 2.0 easily.
</I>
The concept will be the same, but its likely that some code will need to
be changed.

&gt;<i> 1) Write a Jabber component that queries the Jabber server for presence
</I>&gt;<i> info in real time.  My guess is that this would be a bottleneck in web
</I>&gt;<i> page generation.  Or am I wrong...
</I>
And that component would need a subscription to each user that you
wanted to get presence for.

&gt;<i> 2) Write a Jabber component that listens in on &lt;presence&gt; packets and
</I>&gt;<i> keeps a cache in memory.  My JSP bean simply queries the in-memory
</I>&gt;<i> cache.  On cache misses we report &quot;not available&quot; and then request an
</I>&gt;<i> update in the background so our next report is a wee bit more accurate.
</I>&gt;<i> It's OK to be a little bit wrong in my app
</I>
jabberd 1.4 has a presence BCC option that you can use with this.
jabberd 2.0 has a &lt;log/&gt; component bind option that does roughly the
same job (though you'd get copies of all packets, not just presence).

Take a look at &quot;msglog&quot; and &quot;bandersnatch&quot; for some code examples.
They're both on jabberstudio.org, IIRC.

&gt;<i> 3) Same as #2, except drop the presence data into a database.  This
</I>&gt;<i> gives us a more scalable approach.
</I>
Same again, of course.

&gt;<i> 4) Maybe patch the Jabber server to drop presence information directly
</I>&gt;<i> into a database
</I>
Doable via session manager modules. You could just as easily write a
session manager module that makes the session manager query-able for
presence information (which gets around the subscription requirement of
#1).

I'm happy to provide more help once you've decided what you want to do.

Rob.
