<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; - software availability. There is no usable and open source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SIP solution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   for Windows, and there is no good (openh323 is awful and C++) H.323
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   library for Linux. With just RTP it is much better. Client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   would usually have to write their own stuff anyway. Is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easier to do it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   using already implemented XMPP protocol, than to implement another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know the current state of SIP clients.  But I still feel working
</I>&gt;<i> towards established standards like SIP gives everyone a much greater
</I>&gt;<i> chance of interoperability.  Good luck going to a telco/next gen SP and
</I>&gt;<i> convincing them to either switch protocols to XMPP or support another
</I>&gt;<i> one.  Not likely.
</I>
Like ive already said as have others, there is no need for convicing telcos
or anyone else to switch to XMPP or even support it because we can pretty
easily gateway to SIP, so we can still have our own much more appropriate
XMPP based protocol but still be able to talk to SIP users without having to
implement SIP on our client end.

&gt;<i> &gt; Even choice between H323 and SIP is quite hard - probably we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would end with some clients supporting H323, and some client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supporting SIP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nice thing about standards is that many companies provide gateways
</I>&gt;<i> between the two.
</I>
Exactly, and whats stopping us using our own protocol and gatewaying XMPP
&lt;-&gt; SIP??

&gt;<i> &gt; And one more thing. The most easy way to use H323 or SIP in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber is to use some of available H323 or SIP application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But those applications often already include some kind of IM.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So why use Jabber if we need other similar application?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect you're thinking M$'s messenger.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The challenge is getting service developers to adopt Jabber as their IM
</I>&gt;<i> solution.  Unless the app is very simple, new bells and whistles need to
</I>&gt;<i> be added to the set of IM capabilities, in which case an open source
</I>&gt;<i> solution shines.  Try calling Redmond or Dulles and ask them to hack in
</I>&gt;<i> your new feature set, or better yet give you the source code so you can
</I>&gt;<i> do it yourself.  Right.
</I>
Again there is no real need to convice anyone to change over to Jabber for
this to work, this solution based on XMPP is designed for people that are
already using XMPP for their clients and want to support voice without
having to implement whole extra protocols like SIP in their clients as well
as XMPP.
