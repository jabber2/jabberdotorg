Colin,

	Apologies for the delay in responding.  To answer your question, yes I 
do know where you can get what you're looking for.  As I wrote to this 
newsgroup in mid-June, I've been working on cleaning up the configure 
and Makefile that are part of Jabberd v1.4.2 (still the current 
'production quality' open-source Jabber server) so that Jabberd will 
compile under Cygwin as it does under other *nixes.

	I'm still not 100% comfortable with what I've got, but I believe the 
modified files I have are clean and work as expected.  The issues, from 
what I can tell, lie in the interaction between modules and the latest 
Cygwin DLL, though I haven't verified this yet.

	To recap, I now have Jabberd 1.4.2, JUD v0.4, MU-Conference v0.3/v0.52, 
and xdb_sql v1.3 all compiling cleanly under Cygwin, INCLUDING the 
ability to use the --enable-ssl flag to build Jabberd with SSL support. 
  I also have modified the xdb_ldap Makefile, but do not have OpenLDAP 
installed so can't verify the build of that.

The issues that remain (which may not be a problem for you) are:

1.  Jabberd cannot be run with debug -D flag.  This appears to be
     an issue with the latest Cygwin DLL (1.3.22-1 as I write this),
     as running the same executable under an older DLL DOES run.

2.  I can't figure out why, but the latest MU-Conference (v0.52)
     blows up the moment you try to create a conference room.

However, MU-Conference v0.3 works just fine.  Groupchat works like a 
champ, though I haven't beaten on it really hard to verify everything.

	Question:  Are you simply looking for the DLL, or do you want to 
compile everything from source under Cygwin?  I can email you the DLL 
alone, or if you can hang on a few more days, I'd like to post all my 
findings, including a tarball with the modified files, here or wherever 
the JABBER dev community feels is appropriate.  That would give you 
everything you need to build Jabberd, complete with SSL support, and 
anything else you need.
