Contact may not only be added but also changed and removed. During 
affected session user may write confindental messages or send files to
wrong person (eg. he will send it to contact named &quot;stpeter&quot; in his
roster, but it will come to me, not stpeter if I forged the entry). Even
PGP signatures may not help if attacker's key is known to victims
client as it is jid what is checked, not roster name.

Roster on server may also be modified, but some kind os social
engineering will be needed. One may modify forged entry so its name is
spelled wrong. When victims notices that he may fix it, and the entry
with fixed spelling, but the JID still forged will be sent to server.

I agree this bug is not very dangerous (it is mostly theoreticaly), but
it is a bug and should be fixed.
