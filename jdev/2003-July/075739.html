<PRE>I think both. I use the Flashcom server for video and voice and straight 
Flash with the xml socket for the Jabber part. The Flash part stands alone. 
It does all the stuff like rosters, and adding groups, registration, etc, 
and loads mp3's, and jpegs, other swfs, and then since the Flashcom server 
is just a remote server using the rtmp as the protocol -- it can exist as a 
separate service, the individual website operator, or the client's user 
could have an account with a Flashcom provider and use that. Additionally 
there is a free 4 connection developer copy of Flashcom.

The scenario might be that www.somesite.xxx is a jabber server and so they 
would put a copy of my swf on their site along with the attendant xml config 
files. One of the lines in the main config fie, an example is at 
<A HREF="http://swfml.net/JabberFlash/JabberMX.xml">http://swfml.net/JabberFlash/JabberMX.xml</A> another at 
<A HREF="http://swfml.net/JabberFlash/JabberMX2.xml">http://swfml.net/JabberFlash/JabberMX2.xml</A> and note the url of the rtmp 
provider, one is the free developer copy on my personal server and the other 
is the account I maintain with influxis.com which is a 10 simultaneous user 
licence at 10 dollars a month, a developer account. So, a website would 
either provide an account for it's users or else the user would be able to 
use their own. The user can override the config file to change rtmp 
providers.

All that the website has to supply is the one swf file and the config files.

I should mention that the Jabber client is part of a different project and 
making a jabber client is not my main focus, I just did it as an example of 
a module for my other project. It works as a stand alone though.

Greg.

</I>&gt;<i>Greg,
</I>&gt;<i>Are you using the Flash communication server to do what you have described 
</I>&gt;<i>(video, voice etc), or are you just using flash as a development tool with 
</I>&gt;<i>Jabber?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>.... and that so far I too have just skim read the draft I can't really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>comment on how much I like it or not. My question is very practical. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have to come up with something now. I'm perfectly capable of doing it my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>own way so that my client can recognise when it has connected to another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of its kind and then as my clients can have different features activated 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>or not the two would need to negotiate which features they share that are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>compatible and therefore determine amongst other things the layout of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>their respective graphical interfaces. No use having a &quot;See Contact&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>button if contact doesn't have a camera, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>My client, and I don't know what to call it, my &quot;inhouse&quot; name has been 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>JabberBot, but I'm sure someone must have called their client that, so I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>thought of &quot;JabberMX&quot; as it is very tightly integrated with the various 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Macromedia MX stuff, but I see someone once said they were releasing a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>JabberMX so anyway, this client can coordinate up to 12 cameras, 12 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>microphones, play mp3 streams, load graphics or flash swf files, be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>connected to a bot, view video, transfer documents, interact with vxml, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>recieve telephone communication and respond via speech synth or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>microphone(s).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Or, if the client provider (a website administrator) may have set up the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>configuration files so that my client has access to none of the above, or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the enduser may have further modified the starting configuration to deny 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>access to services that it is capable of but doesn't wish to tell contacts 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>how many cameras they have, or even that there is access to a camera.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>For my own use it's pretty simple, I can easily transfer an array of info 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>concerning each client's capabilities and that will take only a short 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>period of time. My client also loads modules though, so it is quite 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>possible that one client will ask the other to recieve a voice message and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the address of the module if the recieving client doesn't have the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>capability at this moment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I figure that it all works out until I come across some client that says 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>sure, they can play mp3's, subscribe me to the stream please, or send the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>url, or whatever, my client needs to let it's user know the capabilities 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of each contact's client so I can send a mp3 to contact1, have a video 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>conference with contacts 2,3,4 and 5 or translate client 7 into German and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>so on .... which is where I'd rather be, so if it's at all possible to set 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>things up as close to the recommended format as I can, I'd like to do 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I'm no real expert on these protocols and JEPs, I've skimmed numerous 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>documents in the course of coding my client, but I'm much more of a copier 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>than anything, so I guess I'd like a little direction, it's not as if I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>can't rewrite code later or anything, I'm just wondering if I should just 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>do things my own way and keep it as modular as I can so that later I can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>conform to protocol?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I'll make another attempt to look at all those documents a bit more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>closely and appreciate any comments as to how I should go about this. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>realize that maybe that there is something I've missed, but yes, I am 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>trying to become familiar with the protocols but no, it isn't the main 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>thing I do so don't hit me if I'm slow.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
