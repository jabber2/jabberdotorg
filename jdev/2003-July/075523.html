Unless you need any special delivery semantics you should be able to embed
your custom namespace in &lt;iq&gt; or &lt;message&gt; tags, which will be passed to the
server without any interference.
&lt;/quote&gt;

Oooh, this is sounding good. Luckily I'm not going to be stressing any
server in the slightest so wedging jabberd/cygwin/whatever and gluing my
stuff around it may be a good first step. If I get all concerned about
performance I can mess about with the server from a win32 perspective - but
for what I'm looking for this seems highly unlikely. Unfortunately the win32
requirement is pretty much set in stone.

My application is basically a central state machine with about 15 objects,
and simple minded queries from the clients. The framework is exactly like
chat rooms with subscriptions/denials and some watered down status queries.
I have a totally lame version of my ideas running kobbled together as a
stripped down IRC server. This was done initially as an excersize with win32
IO completion ports then mighty-morphin'-code-ranger'ed into this project.
Uhm, don't tell the customer it was simply a prototype ;-) I figured since
this worked OK and the basic IRC/chatroom premise also worked, I could
simply expand jabber a little and get all those cool benifits of jabber on
top of what I want to do. My contribution to jabber would be trying to nudge
some win32-isms into it. &lt;i&gt;I didn't mean that in a &lt;b&gt;bad&lt;/b&gt; way...&lt;/i&gt;
