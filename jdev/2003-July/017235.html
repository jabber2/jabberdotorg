<PRE>I'll be implementing the OpenPGP JEP in our new client as it's easy'ish 
to do. But I will need to make some changes to handle real time 
symmetric key exchange as using assymmetric for encryption is just not 
viable. therefore I'll have to a) except my client won't do OpenPGP with 
any other client, or b) work out how to update the existing JEP, which 
is probably not a good idea, or is it?

Basically, I'm mirroring the functionality I have already tested and 
know works in our older (non-Jabber) client until I can see a clear way 
ahead. this gives us end to end crypto, including digital signatures.

David.
