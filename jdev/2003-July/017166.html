<PRE>Don't get me wrong Greg, it sounds like you've done an excellent job.

Its a bit of a disappointment to hear your using the FlashCom server. I 
detest having to pay license fees to the likes of Macromedia for the 
use of the Flashcom server (which add up). On top of that its another 
server maintenance issue. The Flashcom server is useful and I think it 
can be the basis of a good example for us to look at, but Jabber is 
good enough to facilitate the functionality of voice and ip without 
having to embed another technology. I have been working on a way to 
create the Flashcom whiteboard (which could lead to other things) in 
Flash using the JabberFlash Libs without using the Flashcom server, its 
not easy but I think its worth it in the long term. If they can do the 
transports in Flash using the Flashcom server, I'm pretty sure we can 
do it without.

Think of the result, an open source system for everyone to share and 
use, not for big companies like Macromedia to control!

</I>&gt;<i> and the other is the account I maintain with influxis.com which is a 
</I>&gt;<i> 10 simultaneous user licence at 10 dollars a month, a developer 
</I>&gt;<i> account. So, a website would either provide an account for it's users 
</I>&gt;<i> or else the user would be able to use their own. The user can override

</I>&gt;<i> All that the website has to supply is the one swf file and the config

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are you using the Flash communication server to do what you have

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development tool with Jabber?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> .... and that so far I too have just skim read the draft I can't 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> really comment on how much I like it or not. My question is very 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> practical. I have to come up with something now. I'm perfectly 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> capable of doing it my own way so that my client can recognise when 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it has connected to another of its kind and then as my clients can 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have different features activated or not the two would need to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> negotiate which features they share that are compatible and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> therefore determine amongst other things the layout of their 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> respective graphical interfaces. No use having a &quot;See Contact&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> button if contact doesn't have a camera, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My client, and I don't know what to call it, my &quot;inhouse&quot; name has 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> been JabberBot, but I'm sure someone must have called their client 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that, so I thought of &quot;JabberMX&quot; as it is very tightly integrated 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with the various Macromedia MX stuff, but I see someone once said 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they were releasing a JabberMX so anyway, this client can coordinate 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> up to 12 cameras, 12 microphones, play mp3 streams, load graphics or 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> flash swf files, be connected to a bot, view video, transfer 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> documents, interact with vxml, recieve telephone communication and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> respond via speech synth or microphone(s).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or, if the client provider (a website administrator) may have set up 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the configuration files so that my client has access to none of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> above, or the enduser may have further modified the starting 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> configuration to deny access to services that it is capable of but 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't wish to tell contacts how many cameras they have, or even 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that there is access to a camera.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For my own use it's pretty simple, I can easily transfer an array of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> info concerning each client's capabilities and that will take only a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> short period of time. My client also loads modules though, so it is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> quite possible that one client will ask the other to recieve a voice 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> message and the address of the module if the recieving client 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't have the capability at this moment.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I figure that it all works out until I come across some client that 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> says sure, they can play mp3's, subscribe me to the stream please, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or send the url, or whatever, my client needs to let it's user know 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the capabilities of each contact's client so I can send a mp3 to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> contact1, have a video conference with contacts 2,3,4 and 5 or 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> translate client 7 into German and so on .... which is where I'd 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rather be, so if it's at all possible to set things up as close to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the recommended format as I can, I'd like to do that.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm no real expert on these protocols and JEPs, I've skimmed 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> numerous documents in the course of coding my client, but I'm much 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more of a copier than anything, so I guess I'd like a little 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> direction, it's not as if I can't rewrite code later or anything, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm just wondering if I should just do things my own way and keep it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as modular as I can so that later I can conform to protocol?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'll make another attempt to look at all those documents a bit more 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> closely and appreciate any comments as to how I should go about 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this. I realize that maybe that there is something I've missed, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> yes, I am trying to become familiar with the protocols but no, it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> isn't the main thing I do so don't hit me if I'm slow.
