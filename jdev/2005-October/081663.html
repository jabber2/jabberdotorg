The way that I've handled it is to use '<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A>' as the key for looking 
up stored credentials.  Although changing it to use '<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A>/resource' 
as the key, that approach would mean that the user would have to resupply 
credentials if they connect using a different resource value (perhaps this 
means different client, perhaps it means a different instance of the same 
client).

Peter Saint-Andre can probably comment which is the intended approach for 
JEP-100.

&gt;<i> Wouldn't that get rid of the

</I>
The cruftyness comment is because I don't bother to copy the resource 
value from the requesting client to the proxied <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host.</A>  Eg, if you 
start talking to the gateway as '<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A>/Gabber', the proxied connection 
is '<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">joebloe at someotherhost</A>/gateway.processid.timevalue' .

&gt;<i> Also why not move to data forms to address &quot;Certain clients silently
</I>&gt;<i> drop some of the tags requested for registration.&quot;.  That way you can
</I>&gt;<i> make your own fields, and things will just-work(tm).
</I>
I'm not sure I follow you.  I'm passing from the component to the user:

 	&lt;iq from='componentname' to='<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A>/resource' type='result'&gt;
 	   &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'&gt;
 		&lt;instructions&gt;
 			All of the requested fields must be filled in.
 		&lt;/instructions&gt;
 		&lt;username/&gt;
 		&lt;password/&gt;
 		&lt;domain/&gt;
 		&lt;server/&gt;
 		&lt;port/&gt;
 	   &lt;/query&gt;
 	&lt;/iq&gt;

With Gabber, I see a window that asks for:

 	Domain:
 	Password:
 	Server:
 	Port:
 	Username:

With PSI 0.9.3, I see a window that asks for

 	Password:
 	Username:

Debug on PSI shows that the packet is received as quoted above, so its a 
bug in PSI.

However, if I register with Gabber, I can still use the gateway with PSI.

   Up to version 1.6 now.
