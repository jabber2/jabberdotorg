<PRE>
What do people think about extending jabber configuration to allow you
to specify karma settings, but also define a set of netmask IPs that
would have unlimited access? Basically, you would allow additional tags
that look like something this

&lt;karmaExemptions&gt;
	&lt;exempt netmask=&quot;192.168.255.255&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;exempt netmask=&quot;10.255.255.255&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;exempt netmask=&quot;166.77.255.255&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/karmaExemptions&gt;

I'm looking at jabberd/mio.c and it seems like this could be added with
just a few lines of code, maybe along the lines of the following:

1. In mio_init() read any exemptions into an array
2. In mio_listen (and mio_accept) after creating a new mio with
mio_new(), compare the mio's ip with any exempt netmasks. If the new
mio's ip is exempt, set mio-&gt;k.dec = 0.

Then again, I'm just scanning through the code and there could be
dependencies that I don't understand. If I'm missing something, please
let me know.

CONTEXT FOR THIS:

I'm using jabber as the socket layer in a game engine. Flash game
clients (I'm fairly invested in jabber1.x for it's Flash support),
connect to jabber and join a game (MUC) room to recieve game events.
Game state is primarily managed on an application server, which
broadcasts game events to the same MUC rooms that the game clients are
listening on. 

The reason karma is a problem in this architecture is that the game
application server is sending lots and lots of messages to jabber,
spread out across the various game/MUC rooms. For this reason, I need
karma *NOT* to be applied to the application server. On the other hand,
I do want karma applied to game clients connecting over the Internet to
help prevent malicious or misbehaving clients from taking jabber down.
It seems like a good way to achieve this would be to distinquish the
game servers by their private, in-network IPs and specifically exempt
them from the karma system.

If there's a better way to handle this problem than what I described
above, please chime in and let me know. If there isn't, I'll probably
need to implement the extension described above (or convince real jabber
developers to do it). If it does come to that, is this a change that the
jabber community would be interested in having in the public release?

Thanks for your advice and help,
--Larry Kirschner
