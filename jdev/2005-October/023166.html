JabberMaps is ready for public beta testing!  I shall now lazily paste
the text from my blog.  You'll have to go there for all of the fancy
hyperlinks, but here's the main one:

Everybody put your hands together for JabberMaps! Before you say, &quot;hey
hasn't this already been done?&quot; let me answer.

No, it hasn't. This is for servers, not jabber users! Created by CarlB
of Jabberzilla fame, we have a new system for finding the fastest and
most reliable Jabber server for YOU.

When choosing a Jabber server, what are the criteria?

    * Location, for latency issues
    * Uptime, for reliability issues

JabberMaps, by taking advantage of Google Maps (duh, isn't everyone?),
can help you pinpoint precisely where that server is located. Plus it
obtains uptime data from the Public Jabbernet database so you don't
pick a dud. :)

Go there: JabberMaps

Carl has now gotten this app to a stable point and it works well. Now
he needs your help. Please try it out. Tweak all of the buttons, take
it for a drive. Then use the feedback link and please let him know
what you think.

I myself have one comment so far. I'd like to see features, like we
have on the location-challenged jabber.org server list. Other than
that its just great. :)

In case you are curious for some more background, my part in this is
that jabbermaps is hosted on my server. So don't slashdot it please.
Well, I don't think we've had one before so it would be educational
anyways. :/

Also, there has been some new developments since stpeter announced the
XMPP Federation, which aims to be a definitive network resource for
XMPP. I don't actually know this, but I suspect it will replace the
server list on jabber.org. Peter is also collectiong geolocation data,
so there might be some sort of interaction between this database and
JabberMaps in the future. We have discussed moving it to his server as
well to keep the branding that our communiity would benefit from.

Anyway, please do check it out and and report back. :)
