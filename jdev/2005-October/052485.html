They actually complained? Or was the inclusion of DIGEST-MD5 &quot;pre-emptive&quot;?

&gt;<i> Also, must-implement is different from must-deploy.
</I>
And different from &quot;Mandatory-to-Implement Technologies&quot; as the RFC calls  
it? In that case, neither we nor they have to worry that Google Talk is  
&quot;not fully compliant with RFC 3920.&quot; anymore. Still I think it's confusing  
right now, after all if even Ralph makes such a suggestion on the list..  
might be something to think on for rfc3920bis.

&gt;<i> And as noted, we can attempt to fix this stuff in rfc3920bis.
</I>
I can hardly image anyone in the security maffia being happy with  
DIGEST-MD5 over the past 5 years. Maybe they're not as &quot;maffia&quot; as I  
thought ;)
