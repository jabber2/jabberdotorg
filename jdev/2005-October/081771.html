I don't remember the exact chronology -- it was a painful period in my

Well, &quot;mandatory-to-implement&quot; means must-implement in software, but 
that doesn't mean that any particular deployment of that software must 
deploy any particular feature. My understanding is that RFCs talk about 
requirements for software implementation, not necessarily deployment.

&gt;&gt;<i> And as noted, we can attempt to fix this stuff in rfc3920bis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can hardly image anyone in the security maffia being happy with 
</I>&gt;<i> DIGEST-MD5 over the past 5 years. Maybe they're not as &quot;maffia&quot; as I

</I>
We'll certainly bring that up when rfc3920bis is discussed.
