It's not really hard to have your software added to the client list.
But in your case we have a challenge because you are selling
commercial software containing the JABBER name.

&gt;<i> tell me pls... your software has been added to that list?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we was created page - <A HREF="http://safetyjabber.com/trademarks.php">http://safetyjabber.com/trademarks.php</A> maybe
</I>&gt;<i> this helps...

What would help is for you to ask someone who understands English for
assistance, so that I can clearly explain the JABBER trademark
licensing program to you. Your software, &quot;Safety Jabber&quot;, needs to be
licensed so that you can use the JABBER mark in the name. Please see
the following pages:

<A HREF="http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/jabber-trademark/guidelines/">http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/jabber-trademark/guidelines/</A>

<A HREF="http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/jabber-trademark/who-needs-a-license/">http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/jabber-trademark/who-needs-a-license/</A>

I admit that I've been too slow about replying to your email messages
about this matter, and for that I apologize. On the other hand, I've
found communication with you to be far from easy. If you could ask
someone who speaks both Russian and English to help us communicate,
that would be ideal.

Peter

P.S. We wouldn't have this problem if you chose some other name for
your client, like &quot;Safety Chat&quot; or &quot;SafeJab&quot; or somesuch. Most of the
XMPP-based software applications including the word &quot;Jabber&quot; are very
old (from the early days of the jabber open-source community) and they
were all open-source. We've never had to deal with commercial software
containing the JABBER mark, and that's part of the problem here.
