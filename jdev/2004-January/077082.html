Jabberd 1.x series and Jabberd2 can both take care of many, many clients at 
once.  Also for what it's worth you don't need multiple threads to take care 
of multiple network connections (the only development environment where this 
is the case is Java before version 1.4.)

&gt;<i> Also in case we need to implement some extra features in the clients -

I see where you're going now.  You were looking at proxying the real server.  
This is not the way it's usually done.  A Jabber component generally connects 
to the server, logs in as a component, and gets packets forwarded to it based 
on its name amongst other things.

Whether you need to write such a component depends on the feature.  Some 
features can be implemented entirely by the client.  For instance, when you 
make a &quot;jabber:iq:version&quot; query to a user, the query goes straight to the 
user, their client responds, and the response comes straight back.

However, if it's a feature which needs server-like facilities, such as any 
persistent storage or multi-user collaboration, you will need to write a 
component which the server will forward relevant packets to, and which will 
handle these packets and whatever logic is required.  For instance, I 
recently wrote a kind of 'waiting room' component which hears users join and 
gives customer service an anonymised list of users, but removes users from 
the list when the customer service staff ask to speak with them.

Hope this helps.  Actually I'm feeling a bit scattered tonight so I can 
explain further if you want. :-)
