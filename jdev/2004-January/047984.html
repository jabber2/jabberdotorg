Subject: [JDEV] jabberd 1.4 to 2.0 migration script


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


Attached is a Ruby script for migrating jabberd1.4 spool directories to
jabberd2 mysql.  Unlike the script provided with jabberd2 itself, this one
migrates all the data, or at least all the data possible under the jabberd2
database schema.

It migrates offline messages, which was the primary reason for writing it.

Warning: this script is in beta state.  I cannot guarantee it will work on
all
spool directories, and I claim no responsibilities for what damage it might
do to your system.  The last time I ran it, a tiger jumped in my window,
swear to god.  'Buyer beware', YMMV, and so forth.

Requirements:
    - Ruby (tested on 1.8.1 but I don't think I used any new features so it
      might work on earlier.  If it does work on earlier, let me know and
I'll
      update this!)
    - rexml
    - mysql-ruby

To use:
    - cd to your spool directory.
    - type:   /path/to/migrate.rb jabber.example.com &gt; jabber-data.sql

It will sit and whir for a while, telling you every user it's processing as
it
goes through its work.

At present it uses the mysql-ruby library *only* for the string escape
method.
I know this is not ideal, however I'm working in a situation where I can't
run this script on the server so I have to move all the data back to home,
then back to the server.  It could, however, be trivially modified to
connect
to Mysql directly.  I chose Ruby because Perl's XML::DOM didn't feel like it
had enough support for namespaces, though I'm probably wrong.  Either way it
took about the same amount of time to write.

A lot of the things it generates aren't 100% efficient.  Particularly, the
VCard migration is really heavy on the number of SQL statements it
generates.
I could have done it better, but the most important thing was to get it to
work right, fast.  I know also that the VCard conversion isn't 100%.  There
are several VCard fields which are permitted in the VCard multiple times and
as far as I know the database for jabberd2 only allows one of each (that is,
the ADR and EMAIL elements.)

It seems to work for me, with a bit of hacking of the script values I was
able
to set this up on a test server with a different hostname, and my account
was
set up correctly.

Give me feedback, let me know if it works for you, or if it breaks.  If it
breaks, send me a stack trace to me directly (I have TMDA running on my mail
account so you will have to go through a confirmation process, no big deal
but I'll warn you anyway.)

Have fun, chaps.

TX
