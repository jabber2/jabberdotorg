</I>
To be exact, the C standard libraries are at fault here.  Using them to
handle untrusted data is well known to be a Bad Thing, and most highly
secure projects (Apache, qmail, OpenBSD, etc.) have rolled their own
libraries for this reason.

Of course, this still slows down development of secure C apps, but it's
far from an insurmountable problem.

</I>&gt;<i> lame for most C people, and setting up documentation in the WWW would

</I>&gt;<i> jabberd14 and jabberd2 here also.
</I>
I don't see how standardising the documentation format is relevant here.
Documenting software is a very long, boring, hard task, and a flashy GUI
isn't going to make it any easier for me to think of words to explain
what &quot;doInterFast2()&quot; does and why.  As well as that, projects under active
development tend to make documentation obsolete or subtly inaccurate at
a frightening pace, which makes writing it an even more depressing
chore.

&gt;<i> We have no functions in the transports that implement for example per-user
</I>&gt;<i> based settings (looks like nobody wants to implement this without OOP).
</I>
I like OOP (some of my best friends are object-oriented ;), but I really
don't see how it's useful in a jabber transport.  If I did, I'd use C++,
but that's an argument for another day.

On the other hand, implementing per-user settings really is hard without
pubsub, because we can't expect all client authors to bend over
backwards to support every wacky transport feature - that would negate
the whole point of Jabber.

I have to say I'm with Rob on this one: the whole point of a transport
is that you don't notice it until it breaks, so it's not a job you take
on for the glory (personally, my motivation was simply that *I* needed a
decent MSN transport).  As well as this, there's a cultural issue that
many (but by no means all) of the most central people in the Jabber
community see Jabber as the One True Protocol, and all others as
&quot;legacy&quot; protocols that will be going away some time soon, so take a dim
view of people wasting time on transports.

&gt;<i> If you know a way to quickly learn how for example jabberd14's memory
</I>&gt;<i> spool functions work (I'm not talking of &quot;look at the source&quot;), let me
</I>&gt;<i> know. Same for jabberd's other functions (XML handling, XDB handling...).
</I>
It sounds like your problem here is not so much C programs as badly
documented programs.  Again, dislike of documentation is
language-neutral :)

&gt;<i> If you know a good IDE (comparable to Eclipse) that can be used for
</I>&gt;<i> C/Jabber development, let me know.
</I>
This is another interesting cultural issue.  I suspect that the type of
people who like C are the same people who like vi/emacs and associated
tools (I know I am :).  If you aren't that kind of person, you'll
probably be quite lonely in the C community, even if you have no problem
with the language.
