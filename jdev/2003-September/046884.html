<PRE>Hi,

Hashed passwords do not give 100% security. Let's take a web based email 
system that uses mysql as a db. You can easily make use of the 
password() function in mysql to create a oneway hashed password. But a 
malicious user who does not have root access but has access to the mysql 
db can reset your password to something of his choosing, login to your 
account send a nasty mail to your boss and change the password back to 
what it was before.

Having said that i am no advocate of plain text passwords :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Well, I think that plaintext passwords on the wire are more of an issue

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Basically, until we get auth mechanisms that are secure on the wire and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>be storing passwords in plaintext.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have to admit that I have never understood this (maybe someone can
</I>&gt;<i>explain) - sending plain text over the wire is bad, but it's a different
</I>&gt;<i>issue than storing them in plain text on the server.  At least when you send
</I>&gt;<i>them there is a limited window for someone to sniff your password.  They
</I>&gt;<i>have to be either lucky, or actually trying to find out what your password
</I>&gt;<i>is.  With plaintext files on the server you have a 24x7 risk of someone
</I>&gt;<i>getting root access and just sniffing around to find out if there is
</I>&gt;<i>something interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but what is the harm in
</I>&gt;<i>encrypting/hashing/obfuscating them?  It seems bad form to have plain text
</I>&gt;<i>passwords stored anywhere when there is some sort of alternative (even if
</I>&gt;<i>it's not a particuarly good one).  The only con I can possibly think of is
</I>&gt;<i>that it might give the admin a false sense of security - but I can't see
</I>&gt;<i>that as a major issue, and probably one that can be addressed in the
</I>&gt;<i>documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, they are not going to be 100% secure
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, they have to be turned back into plaintext to be sent to the remote
</I>&gt;<i>server
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, it's bad that they have to be sent over the wire in plain text
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, the admin SHOULD have the permissions set so no one but him/her can
</I>&gt;<i>read them
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But on the other hand:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's not hard to do.  (Hell, even ROT13ing them would be an improvment over
</I>&gt;<i>plain text)
</I>&gt;<i>It stops a trusted admin from accidently/in good faith reading/remembering
</I>&gt;<i>them
</I>&gt;<i>Hashed passwords are MUCH harder to remember than plaintext ones (which are
</I>&gt;<i>usually dictionary words)
</I>&gt;<i>It lessens the chance of some script kiddy getting hold of the password
</I>&gt;<i>file, and realising that he/she has a bunch of AIM/ICQ/MSN passwords and
</I>&gt;<i>going nuts with them
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's kind of like putting a lock on a glass door.  The effort to find
</I>&gt;<i>something to break the glass with is going to be enough to deter some
</I>&gt;<i>people, but it won't stop someone who is really intent on getting inside.  I
</I>&gt;<i>don't know of any (Windows) clients that store the password in plain text in
</I>&gt;<i>the registry/config file - and in theory you trust everyone who you give
</I>&gt;<i>access to your PC.  I would be very surprised if when I clicked &quot;Remember
</I>&gt;<i>this password&quot; in IE if I could then find it in plain text on my Win2000
</I>&gt;<i>machine.
