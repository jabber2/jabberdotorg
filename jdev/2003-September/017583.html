i'd really stick with the java solution. j2me supports video and audio 
capturing on the nokia 63xx (63 something) already and other platforms 
will be covered very soon (be sure).

make sure you don't use any swing classes and stick to plain awt. 
depending on the contract with your phone provider you will be able to 
load jar/jad files or you won't ;-|. If you can't load them, speak with 
your contract partner, i bet you'll have some hard times with your 
provider.

really stick with java - it makes everything much simpler - your project 
are two-three hours if you know how to do it.
