I know that Java can be fast and I don't want take part at the flames on
different languages.

But one fact I want to add: It's not that the transports are just small
processes and the Jabber server does the most. At amessage _most_
computing power is needed for the transports. This may be because they
are coded so badly or because they use libraries that were never
indended to be used for transports. But nobody should think that you
don't have to care for performance in transports as they don't have to
do much, this is just not true.
