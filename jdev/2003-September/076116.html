<PRE>Hi,

I'm working on a jabber solution for the US Coast Guard. One feature they
want is automatic roster population (no problem there). They also want to
lock down the groups that were automatically populated so the user can't
mess with them (not too hard) but here's the difficulty: they want to have a
column in the rostergroups table to mark that the group was automatically
generated. Using jabberd 1.4.2 on Linux with xdb_sql and a mysql database
but we will be moving to Solaris and Oracle soon though, with the client in
Java (and I've not used large-scale Java before... whee!). 

Then the client needs to block modification of those groups marked as
auto-generated. I'm new to this whole project, I took over for someone a few
weeks back and I'm still trying to figure it all out.  The documentation
I've read has confused me more than helped, and Google has not been my
friend. Has anyone done anything like this (added stuff to the protocol)?
Obviously the client needs to know how to handle it, but would it require
changing the server source and rebuilding? Or just xdb_sql? Any pointers in
the right direction would be appreciated.

Thanks!
