Well perhaps as I'm subscribed with a @jabberstudio address some mails got
lost during Hades' re-installation or something.

Of course not. I just wanted to show a way to make a project more
attractive for contributors; for my part, a always find a project complete
with for example a good and simple website and a way to quickly get a
glance of its code (ViewCVS is a bit clumsy for that) more interesting but
again that's only me and it's perfectly possible other people don't care
about this.

As for the other topics, I did not refer to MSN-TNG specifically, sorry if
you felt offended.
