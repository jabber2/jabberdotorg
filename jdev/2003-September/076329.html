&gt;<i> First, it is already possible to do &quot;promiscuous presence&quot; in jabberd 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.4.2 using the &quot;presence bcc&quot; markup in the jabber.xml configuration 
</I>&gt;<i> file -- see the release notes. This feature pipes all the 
</I>&gt;<i> presence off 
</I>&gt;<i> to another JID (usually a component), which can provide an API for 
</I>&gt;<i> sending presence out to whomever you please.
</I>
It was much easier to write this as a patch to Jabber, as all the
structures and code were already there to support it, and can
inject/modify the stream wherever needed.  It's a relatively minor tweak
on how the server handles 'available'.

&gt;<i> Second, you can't just add new presence types to the 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol. :-) This 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol is now in IETF Last Call. Just as you can't add a new HTTP 
</I>&gt;<i> method because you think PUT and GET are not enough, you 
</I>&gt;<i> can't add new 
</I>&gt;<i> presence types willy-nilly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with you that community building might require something like 
</I>&gt;<i> this, and putting that under the control of the user is good. But I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't think that a new presence type is the best way to make 
</I>&gt;<i> that happen.
</I>
It could also be implemented as an optional namespace under &lt;presence&gt;,
e.g., the client could send &lt;presence type=&quot;available&quot;&gt;&lt;promiscuous
xmlns=&quot;...&quot;/&gt;...&lt;/presence&gt; and capable servers would use it and
incapable servers would ignore it and just treat it as a normal
'available' presence.  That wouldn't modify the protocol afaik.  I
figured it would make more sense as a type due to the way 'invisible'
had been implemented as a type instead of making it a tag under a
type=&quot;unavailable&quot;.  Would the promiscuous tag under presence as
mentioned be better?
