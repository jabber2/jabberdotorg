<PRE>At some point in the past, we listed a disco category for client types,
however this was removed because it was not well thought out. I've been
thinking about this some more and a few people have poked me about it, 
so I think we need to define category/type combinations for clients, as
we do for gateways and other categories listed here:

<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/registrar/disco-categories.html">http://www.jabber.org/registrar/disco-categories.html</A>

After discussion with several people interested in this topic, I've come
up with the following list:

- handheld  [client on PDA or other small device]
- pc        [traditional desktop/laptop client]
- phone     [client on mobile phone or other telephony device]
- web       [browser-based client]

These seem clear to me. It's possible other client types exist, but I'm
not creative enough to think up what they are right now. In any case, we 
can always add new types later if needed.

Note well that these are client types, not connection types (WAP, GPRS, 
etc.). Also this category does not address situations such as connecting 
through a gateway (e.g., SMS). Those issues need more thought.

In my role as Jabber Registrar, I plan to add a disco category for
clients (with the types listed above) sometime in the next week. If you 
have a strong interest in this topic or disagree with the client types 
listed above, please let me know in the next few days.

Thanks.

Peter
