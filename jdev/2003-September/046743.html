Well I have contributed quite a bit to AIM/ICQ-t and JIT. AIM/ICQ-t is
frustrating since libfaim is far from intuitive. JIT is a lot better
(since it uses libicq2000 which is coded in C++). Be assured if there was
a Java transport I already would have coded *by far* more (in fact I hope
to combine JGF and MIU once they both reach a usable state).

&gt;<i>From my point of view JIT greatly benefits from the fact that libicq2000
</I>is coded in C++. Also, the fact that JIT is at least a bit commented with
Doxygen comments (Doxygen docs for JIT are generated automatically and
available from its website) makes understanding the code a great deal
easier. I find it a pity that neither jabberd14 nor jabberd2 nor most
other projects (transports...) make use of Doxygen or something similar or
have docs online.

You are the jabberd2 author?- I'd like to contribute by helping with code
docs. Contact me by mail if you agree.

Regards
