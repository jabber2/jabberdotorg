For me this is pretty clear:

More web integration!

I've said this before on JDEV but IMO this is a _huge_ opportunity for 
Jabber. It's fairly easy to integrate Jabber in a website/app but for a 
lot of users it's quite a hassle to either setup a Jabber server with a 
HTTP component or to setup a bot that can run 24/7. IMO it would be 
great if there was something like WCS that could just POST or GET Jabber 
messages to a simple webscript. This would enable Jabber functionality 
in a lot of applications almost instantly. It would also greatly 
increase the functionality of Jabber, increase the advantage over other 
systems and increase the visibility of Jabber to the 'normal user'.
