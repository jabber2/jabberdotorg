<PRE>Hi Robert!

To my own experience it does not take very much time to write doxygen
comments while you are coding. Often you write the same comment that
could be used but do not mark it as a doxygen comment and therefore it
can not be used to generated an extraction of code comments.

&gt;<i> If people want it, then I'll start writing some. But unless its obvious

It meight be good to just start writing comments, better partially
commented code than uncommented code, I think ;)

But it is something you have to do and something you want to do. It's
also better to have uncommented code than to have no code. And I am
really looking forward to be able to use jabberd2. Thanks for your work.


Tot kijk
