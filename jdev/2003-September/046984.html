- &quot;Transports&amp;contacts&quot; thread on jdev in January 2003

(this is almost the same as the current thread)

&gt;<i> I've been thinking about allowing (with certain restrictions) entities
</I>&gt;<i> to set and get a users roster. This (by itself) would require no client
</I>&gt;<i> changes. Basically, a transport could do normal roster get/set
</I>&gt;<i> operations (just like a client)
</I>
If this was handled by extension of &quot;subscribed&quot; presence, it even would
be more or less backwards compatible with jabberd14. But of course if it
breaks XMPP...

&gt;<i>  - It allows transports to override the normal Jabber roster semantics.
</I>
As Andrew said, the normal roster semantics is to *add new* contacts but
we *import existing* contacts here. It's simply a thing that does not
occur with Jabber-only usage.

&gt;<i>  - Suitable access controls are required. Obviously, it won't do to
</I>&gt;<i>    allow anyone to change anyone elses roster. One thought we had is to
</I>&gt;<i>    restrict operations based on the transport JID (domain) - ie, the
</I>&gt;<i>    transport can only set roster items of its own users, and when a
</I>&gt;<i>    roster is retrieved, it only receives items for its own users.
</I>
(Roster retrieval would be indeed great and solve a great deal of hassle I
described in <A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.network.jabber.devel/20097">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.network.jabber.devel/20097</A> :-)

&gt;<i>  - It seems that some sort of opt-in mechanism is required, whereby
</I>&gt;<i>    users can authorise certain remote entities to modify their roster.
</I>&gt;<i>    However, this requires client support, unless someone can think of
</I>&gt;<i>    something better (one hackish idea we had was to make it based on
</I>&gt;<i>    whether or not you've subscribed to a server (domain only) - if you
</I>&gt;<i>    have, then they can play).
</I>
One can combine these ideas - no opt-in required if domain already added
to roster, opt-in required if not. Registering with the transport (and the
following s10n exchange) means &quot;I want to use the transport's services and
let the transport do what it needs to&quot; I think.
