On videocaputure and such: It is possible to play and capture 
audiostream and videostreams using the MMAPI extention. However, just 
that the J2ME implementation you use support MMAPI does not mean that 
capture works, since maybe it's just used for playback. 

One device I know of that *does* support capture through the MMAPI 
extention is the Nokia 3650. However, this is limited to camera stills. 
No audio or video. With the MIDP 2.0 profile support for MMAPI will be 
mandatory. But again limited to playback.

Well, we were talking about the P800 here. The P800 support 2 versions 
of Java. PersonalJava or PJava, wich works with AWT, and J2ME/MIDP. 


J2ME has its
&gt;<i>own display classes (lcdui).
</I>
lcdui is from the MIDP profile. So with J2ME/MIDP it is common to use 
lcdui. MIDP isn't the only profile for J2ME however! Another is PDAP, 
wich is actually based on PJava (wich is now obsolete). So this is a 
J2ME profile that does use AWT. However I haven't seen it on any phones 
yet, maybe the succesor of the P800 will support it instead of PJava. 
That does mean you'll loose JNI though since that is not supported by 
J2ME.
