well, if someone is say, running an mp3 stream and also a jabber bot that handles requests and track information; because mp3 streams can't handle any information 
other than the stream title and current track (well, as one whole string), it would be handy so that if a listener wants information about the track beyond 'artist - title', 
they could have it provided to them via jabber. that a point; 'filename' might be a handy value as well.

might it be an idea to have (in the implementation, rather than the jep?) two different forms of data sent; a 'simple' version with just the basics, and an 'expanded' 
version that hold more information about a track for those who would like it.
