The only thing 2 way encryption will give you is a false sense of 
security. From a security point of view this adds *nothing*. However, 
some admins might consider it &quot;secure&quot; since it has the word 
&quot;encryption&quot; in it, and not pay attention to filepermissions. This will 
not make Jabber any more secure from a security standpoint, but you 
might *feel* more secure about it. 

Anyway, if you still want it, it shouldn't be that hard to write a 
patch for either, you can just XOR whatever you write to the disk, then 
XOR it again when you read it. 

If you want *real* security in wich you do not have to trust the admin 
with your passwords and where passwords will only be exposed during 
registration, as said before SASL can do that. If you don't even want 
your password to be exposed during registration, it's possible if you 
adapt jabber:iq:register for it. 

As for the transports, as already said, in most cases it's only 
possible if you adapt the clients to assit in the authentication 
process.
