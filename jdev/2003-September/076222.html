In 99% of the (non-test) implementations you want to use an existing 
userdatabase and you at least want some control over the userbase (admin 
tools etc). So I would propose to drop inband registration (to help both 
new users and to make clients easier) and to include a small tool with 
the Jabber server to manually create (test) accounts.

Jabber servers that are going to be used by ISPs and companies will most 
definately disable in-band registration anyway which leaves public 
servers and test servers. Public servers need something more than only a 
jabber server, it would be nice if there was at least some kind of 
contact info and people with test servers can just use the admin tools 
that come with the server.

IMO this would also make the user experience more consistent because at 
the moment with some servers you can do in-band registration and with 
other servers you can't :\
