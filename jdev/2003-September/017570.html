</I>&gt;<i>Does anyone else see it as a concern that the Jabber server (1.4.2
</I>&gt;<i>release) and popular transports (aim-t, jit, msn-t, and yahoo-t) save
</I>&gt;<i>user account information (user name and password) in plaintext for

&gt;<i>From the last discussion on this subject, it turns out with SASL's 
</I>digest-MD5 method (so with Jabberd2 as well I suppose?) it is possible 
to store passwords in secure hash form. Registration with 
jabber:iq:register will still be done in plaintext, till it is adapted 
for this mechanism. 

But even then, I wouldn't give anyone read acces to your jabber files 
that shouldn't really have it. 

As for transports, since most networks currently require acces to 
plaintext passwords to do authentication with them there is only one 
alternative, mapping the authenitcation to Jabber and let the clients 
handle it. That would mean however that for every forgein network you 
want to use the client would have to implement that authentication 
process. Wich on most networks is also the most frequently changed 
feature. For example for MSN first would have had to implement SHA1 
authentication in your messenger, but now you'd have to tunnel SSL over 
your Jabber stream. I can imagine most client authors would like it 
better if you just restrict read-acces on your server ;)
