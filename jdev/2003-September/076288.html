Hmm, this packet is most certainly allowed.  Maybe you encountered a bug in 
your client library or server software?  Go read the XMPP drafts and see for 
yourself what is possible:

XMPP/Jabber is absolutely not limited to IM.  It has so much more potential.  
It could be used as the basis for nearly any Internet protocol.  Consider it 
more of a building block, as way of easily delivering data and handling 
transactions between different points, and you'll see things clearer.
