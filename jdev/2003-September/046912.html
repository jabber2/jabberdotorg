<PRE>&gt;<i> In fact, I do not like sysadmins (myself included) knowing users'
</I>&gt;<i> passwords on the systems _I_ manage.  But that's drifting off-topic, so
</I>&gt;<i> let's hold that thought for a minute.
</I>
Thats personal preference really and is upto the admin concerned, if an
admin does not want to be able to see the passwords there are ways.

&gt;<i> The next question along this line might be:  where does the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of such a feature, should it be desired, lie?  Does it
</I>&gt;<i> require a change in any way to Jabber/XMPP that requires the 'designers'
</I>&gt;<i> of the protocol?
</I>
Nope not really to do with the protocol per se.

&gt;<i> If not, does it lie with the JabberD team?  (Remember,
</I>&gt;<i> Rob Norris is the guy writing JabberD2, so BE NICE! :-) )  Or does it
</I>&gt;<i> lie with the transport writers?
</I>
Both, if you are doing reversable encryption (which is the only way it can
work ATM AFAIK)

&gt;<i> When you know the answer to this
</I>&gt;<i> question, politely ask those responsible if there might be a way to have
</I>&gt;<i> such a feature.  Or, as always with open source, grab some code and go
</I>&gt;<i> crazy. :-)
</I>
Go ahead and add feature requests :)

&gt;<i> Might I suggest one possibility?  Again, for those reading this, please
</I>&gt;<i> note Rob Norris is &quot;the man&quot; with regards to JabberD2 development, so be
</I>&gt;<i> nice.  Would it be possible, Rob, to offer the option to the JabberD
</I>&gt;<i> admin to store passwords using, say, MD5 hashes?  Passwords would still
</I>&gt;<i> come from clients as they do now.  The only change required is how
</I>&gt;<i> JabberD stores them and, if it's configured to use MD5, how it does the
</I>&gt;<i> comparison; i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (plaintext_sent = plaintext_stored)
</I>&gt;<i> vs.
</I>&gt;<i> (MD5(plaintext_sent) = hash_stored)
</I>
Nope currently not possible (as already discussed), the only option is
reversable encryption, the original plaintext password is required for the
current authentication mechanisms to operate, read Matthias explaination.

&gt;<i> As for the original transport question, reversible encryption might be
</I>&gt;<i> an option (though again, not sure who needs to be buttered up in that
</I>&gt;<i> regard).
</I>
The only real option see above.

&gt;<i> Personally, I would love to see NO 3rd party passwords stored on the
</I>&gt;<i> server, but rather have the Jabber client send any 3rd party passwords
</I>&gt;<i> whenever the client connects (this way the USER is responsible at the
</I>&gt;<i> client side for securing that information, and jabber admins don't have
</I>&gt;<i> culpability for compromises passwords of systems they do not manage).
</I>&gt;<i> However, I understand that would require a fundamental change in the way
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber works, if only because the user would be required to re-enter all
</I>&gt;<i> that 3rd party information from EACH client PC they used, as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> having the Jabber server store it for them (a la rosters, etc.).
</I>
Yup creating a mechanism for the client handling auth is a possibility that
ive been thinking about, but it does require protocol additions, changes to
transports and all clients accessing them, so unless their is a major push
by a large number of people then I dont see it happening.
