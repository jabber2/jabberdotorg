<PRE>Hi Robert!


Go on and implement storage of hashed passwords for SASL-MD5 as it may
help to get Jabber users feeling better. I am tired of this discussion.

But I want to note that we will not really get additional security of
it. If the hash is calculated the way you describe it, you don't need
more to authenticate against the server (or any other server using SASL
with MD5) than this hash. Therefore something that has to be protected
as hard as plain text passwords are again in the storage.

I just can hope that people do not start to make the access to these
files world readable (e.g. because they want to parse vCards in PHP
scripts on their web servers) because they think that nothing security
relevant is in the stored data.

The only thing we might get from it (if admins keep protecting the data)
is that admins can't get the plain text password in the hope that a
users uses it for other services as well. But if it really wants to
hijack the password nobody stopps him from disabling password hashing,
forcing plaintext authentication (and sniffing the login) or things like
that.
