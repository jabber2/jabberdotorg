<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course I agree that documentation within jabberd2 has been a problem,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and that real API docs would be a good thing. The problem I've had is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; severe lack of time - its taken 18 months to get the server to beta, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thats without writing docs - how much longer would it take if I had?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To my own experience it does not take very much time to write doxygen
</I>&gt;<i> comments while you are coding. Often you write the same comment that
</I>&gt;<i> could be used but do not mark it as a doxygen comment and therefore it
</I>&gt;<i> can not be used to generated an extraction of code comments.
</I>
I guess I need to look at what doxygen does. My understanding is that it
extracts comments throughout the code, which seems fairly useless for
API docs.

&gt;<i> &gt; If people want it, then I'll start writing some. But unless its obvious
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to me that it will result in code being contributed, I'm reluctant to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spend large amounts of potential coding time on it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It meight be good to just start writing comments, better partially
</I>&gt;<i> commented code than uncommented code, I think ;)
</I>
Well, I write plenty of comments, though I'll admit that I don't write
as many when I've got a good but large idea to implement :P

&gt;<i> But it is something you have to do and something you want to do. It's
</I>&gt;<i> also better to have uncommented code than to have no code. And I am
</I>&gt;<i> really looking forward to be able to use jabberd2. Thanks for your work.
</I>
I'll never want to do it, but I do think its necessary. Like I say, if
enough people want it, I'll do it.

Rob.
