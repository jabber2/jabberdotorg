<PRE>Hello Michael.

I can't answer your question, as I am not fluent in XMPP-ish myself, 
however there is one point you should note -- though technically you 
could get away with putting logic only in the clients to block changes 
(using XMPP's standard way to enhance the protocol; you can find info 
about it in lots of places), you shouldn't -- the server must handle 
this logic. Why? because if the server will only be a data-store for 
this kind of data people could login using some other XMPP client and 
avoid the restrictions, and that is probably a security problem, or at 
least a wrong implementation of specifications.

Alon.
