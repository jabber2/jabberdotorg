<PRE>I'm probably going to write a Jabber client for the SonyEricsson P800:
<A HREF="http://www.sonyericsson.com/P800/main.htm">http://www.sonyericsson.com/P800/main.htm</A>

during a 6x40 hour project at the university. I've just bought a Palm 
Zire 71 for my girlfriend and I'm going to buy a Palm Tungsten T3 when 
it arrives to I'd really like it if the client that I write for the P800 
would also run on the Palms..

The problem is that I'm kind of in over my head here :D I'm pretty 
fluent in PHP but I've only got a little bit of experience in C and even 
less experience in C++ and Java :D So it's going to be a rough ride.

I've been doing some research on how to approach this project. It's 
fairly obvious to me that I won't be able to learn Java/C and write a 
client for a mobile platform from scratch in those weeks, especially 
since the P800 version will need to have camera support and it has to be 
able to share those pictures with a remote device through Jabber.

I'm curious what your thoughs are on this project. What language should 
I use, what development packages are available, what packages work well? 
Are there existing clients that I've used (I've found a few but knowing 
the Jabber community I've probably missed a couple). Other thoughts?

The requirements for the university seem to be fairly straight forward. 
It's mostly about sending pictures with some text to a remote device 
through Jabber with a P800 (which can run Java and it's running Symbian 
OS itself). They seem to prefer a Java solution but IMO that's partially 
because they're not really aware of the available options.

Any help or pointers would be very much appreciated!

Bart
