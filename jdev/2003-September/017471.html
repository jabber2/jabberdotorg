I think you are wrong, performance is main issue. I administrate 
jabber.wp.pl server with
over 500 thousands registered users. I have installed mysql search, ldap 
authentication
and JSM with jabber:iq:privacy ( You can becaome invosible for defined 
users, for example ).

I have no memory leaks and whole system works perfectly.
All servers are written in C and C++.

I'm sure servers in java willn't be as fast as servers in C, and java 
server would need 2x-5x more memory.

All advantages that java has:
 - fast development
 - libs
jabber also has.
Jabber has very good lib and memory management.

JIT uses libstdc++, very good library with hashes, trees, strings 
......, all you need.
 
Do you know how easy is to write module for jabber in C ?
Look at PHP module, I have written this module with my frined in one day.

You can use PHP jabber module if you want to have 100 users online.
In PHP you can write auth,search, xdb, log, archive mechanizm. Then you 
can use any database
that PHP supports.

But only servers written in C can handle 1 mln users online.

Lukas
