Of course this is not an insurmountable problem. One can cope with that
with a little effort. But so one has to do for innumerable other things
that are only a problem because C lacks. So we simply *don't* cope with
the problem (save we have very much manpower). That's the current status.

</I>
I'm talking of code documentation, not user documentation. Just like
JavaDoc, Doxygen can provide a simple and handy code documentation once it
is set up and the code is commented accordingly. You know Doxygen or
JavaDoc?

&gt;<i> As well as that, projects under active development tend to make
</I>&gt;<i> documentation obsolete
</I>
JavaDoc/Doxygen documentation is at every time in sync with the code as
it's *part* of the code.

</I>
As a quick hack, one could configure the transports simply by messaging
the transport contact (no pubsub required but of course this can also be
implemented). And you know what?- JGF supports that. No C or C++ transport
does. Strange, isn't it? ;-)

</I>
Yes, I acknowledge the &quot;C vs. Java&quot; statement was a bit too short. But
take a look at the reality. While most Java libraries are documented in at
least some way (for JavaDoc was available at every time and a standard for
Java), you can't say the same for most C or C++ projects. Or at least
that's my impression.

Well, enough rant. While I can't help people really wanting to torture
themselves with C ;-), I hereby offer to help with the code documentation
issue to any projects that are interested (by setting up Doxygen or
something similar).
