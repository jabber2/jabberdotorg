<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The use of a two way algorithm would still require the user do more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; than cat the file to find the password.  Why should we make it as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; easy as possible for people (admins or not) to find out other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; people's passwords?  If anything we should be taking every possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; step to do exactly the opposite.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because as already mentioned transports simply wont work if you cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; obtain the original plaintext password, also current authentication
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; schemes will not work either, and as ive already said it makes it very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult to integrate jabber into an existing system if you cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get at the plaintext password.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please reread my statement.  I referenced the use of a two way
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm, not a one way.  A two way algorithm would allow the
</I>&gt;<i> transports and server access to the original plaintext password.
</I>
I did, I was reading the statement &quot;Why should we make it as easy as
possible for people (admins or not) to find out other people's passwords?&quot;,
which I read as meaning that we should be using one way hashes and not two
way encryption.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Simple because thousands of applications do it doesn't mean it's the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; correct thing to do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ofcouse it doesnt mean its the best thing to do in an ideal world, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because we live in the real world a lot of people will want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; integrate jabber with those existing applications, we cannot simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ignore their existance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, what about using a two way algorithm would stop us from doing so?
</I>
Read my statement above, I was not talking about two way, I also read this
statement as meaning that we should be hashing all passwords and ignoring
the thousands of applications you think are doing things wrong.
