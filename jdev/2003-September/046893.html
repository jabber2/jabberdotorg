<PRE>Hi Ulrich!

I havn't read the original posting very carefully and did not notice
that it only had to be implemented for one phone. If you want to be
portable you can not use manufactor based extensions like an AWT
implementation.

</I>&gt;<i> do - until i finally reached a guy who told me WAP and java applications 
</I>&gt;<i> are not the same - neither are the terms &quot;internet services&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;downloading java applications&quot;. krass but true.
</I>
I did not say that all providers allow you to access MIDlets but that
nearly all will allow it. And I said that you will always be able to
install them over a local connection to your PC.

It is true that WAP and Internet are different in the networks of may
mobile phone companies. You have to use different APNs if you use GPRS.
On the WAP-APN you can only access the WAP gateway and on the
Internet-APN the standard port numbers 920x are blocked. Technically
they are not really different its just a matter of accounting. I am
operating my own WAP gateway for myself as my provider sells Internet
traffic cheaper than WAP traffic.

JAR and JAD files are loaded by the phone over the the internet
connection, with many phones (like the Nokia 6310i) you can even not
configure a different APN for Internet and MIDlet download. The reason
why it is not downloaded over the WAP gateway is that the WAP phone
communicates with the gateway over UDP. Files requested over the WAP
gateway have to fit in one UDP packet which is not possible for files of
the typical size of a MIDlet.

If your provider blocks download of JAD/JAR files, I expect he is
routing all traffic to port 80 over a transparent proxy and filters
these files on the proxy. You might be able to trick your provider by
using other ports for the server where you download the MIDlets. In any
case: If you configure your phone to access the internet over CSD
instead of GPRS your provider has no access to your internet connection
as you can use any PPP dialin. They only thing it has to allow is to
establish data calls (again something most (not all) providers allow even for
prepaid accounts since the time of WAP)

&gt;<i> whenever i renamed the jar file on my server to something else (ie. .JA) 
</I>&gt;<i> the file could be downloaded/accessed (but not started, since the jar 
</I>&gt;<i> file required to be loaded from a jad file). when i loaded it through 
</I>&gt;<i> the jad file i had no entry in my server's log file - try it.
</I>
I have neither a Telekom Austria nor an prepaid account. My provider
allows me nearly full access to the internet. It only filters the
standard UDP ports of WAP gateways on its Internet APN.
