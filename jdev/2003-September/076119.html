<PRE>Client logins are generated automatically by the page that produces the
applet, and then once they login their user/pass (temporarily created for
login) is removed from the database, and (if I recall properly... I'm still
new to the project) the server has been setup so that no new accounts can be
generated on the server by any client, so the only way to have a user/pass
be availible is for someone to manually enter it in the database (which
would be restricted to only those who need to do that) and by the code that
outputs the applet.

Hello Michael.

I can't answer your question, as I am not fluent in XMPP-ish myself, 
however there is one point you should note -- though technically you 
could get away with putting logic only in the clients to block changes 
(using XMPP's standard way to enhance the protocol; you can find info 
about it in lots of places), you shouldn't -- the server must handle 
this logic. Why? because if the server will only be a data-store for 
this kind of data people could login using some other XMPP client and 
avoid the restrictions, and that is probably a security problem, or at 
least a wrong implementation of specifications.

Alon.
