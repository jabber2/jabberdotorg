That's actually almost certainly why the server was barfing on the
data -- bad UTF-8, not bad XML. For example, IIRC, a byte >127
indicates the first byte of a multibyte character, and the subsequent
byte(s) of the same character are supposed to also have the high bit
set. So any three byte sequence of the form [<<128] [>=128] [<<128]
would be illegal UTF-8 and cause the parser to barf.


So David's recommendation to go with base64 should fix the problem.
