According to the examples in the JPO [1.6.5], the results of
jabber:iq:browse queries have a weird/nonstandard structure. The <<iq
type=result> node has direct child elements that are browse-specific,
like <<service> or <<conference>, and there's no xmlns specified.
Isn't this illegal?


I'm guessing that these examples are incorrect and that the contents
of the <<iq> should actually be a standard <<query
xmlns="jabber:iq:browse> element containing the browse-specific stuff.
Correct?
