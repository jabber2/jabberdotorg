<excerpt>I'm curious what the feeling of the group is on the relative
value of

the Jabber Programmers Guide (JPG) vs. the Jabber Protocol Overview

(JPO).

I think the JPO should follow a tutorial style that's careful to
develop topics in an easy-to-understand order, while the JPG should be
a reference arranged in some alphabetic order by entity name (much as
it is today.) The JPO shouldn't go into excessive depth on the details
but should provide links to the topic in the JPG.


My Cheat Sheet is far from complete but shows one way that a JPO could
be structured. Of course its organization and text are very much from
the client perspective, and more material would be needed, or a
separate guide, from the perspective of someone working on a transport
or on a server itself.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
