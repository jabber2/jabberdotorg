You probably need to convert the non-ascii characters into whatever
encoding libxode is expecting (most likely UTF-8). I would guess that
you are using your system's native character set, which is probably
not Unicode or UTF-8.


So check the libxode docs (if any) or source code to see what kind of
encoding it expects. Then if there is a mismatch, you'll need to
convert your text into the right encoding; your OS may have utilities
for doing this.
