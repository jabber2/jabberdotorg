is an interesting debate. I started working with jabber some time ago
thinking of resource as a location, but now that I’ve used Jabber more

I basically agree. But for a PC based client, "location" seems like a
relatively good shorthand name, better than "resource". It's quite
appropriate for a fixed desktop machine, not quite so much for a
laptops, but I think people will get the idea.


Anyway, it doesn't matter so much to me what name the clients use for
"location", so long as they manage to get the resource name set to
something appropriate, which in most cases will require popping up a
dialog in the user's face the first time the app's run (perhaps as
part of the general setup UI.)
