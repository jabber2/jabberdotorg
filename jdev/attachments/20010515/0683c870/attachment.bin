I agree. And this brings up a tangential question: what are the rules
for Jabber clients' use of the Jabber "lightbulb" logo, and where can
I get a canonical image of the logo to use in my client? I haven't
seen any on the websites (wherever the logo appears it's joined into
some other artwork in such a way that extracting it would be beyond my
artistic skills.)<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
