Unfortunately it doesn't seem that existing clients deal with resource
names very well. For example, gabber and Jabbernaut just seem to use
the name of the app as the resource name, which is pretty useless. In
Jabbernaut (dunno about gabber) it is possible to go into a pref
dialog and set a different resource name, but most people won't figure
this out on their own or understand what it's supposed to be used for.


By contrast, in my [embryonic] client I <italic>require</italic> the
user to enter a resource name the first time the program's run. The
modal dialog refers to it as a "location name" and explains what it's
used for. The resource name entered is saved as a per-user-per-machine
preference. (It can later be edited in the prefs if the user changes
her mind.)


Each buddy entry in my client's buddy list also shows the name of the
highest priority online resource, so you see "Joe Blow at work" or
"Joe Blow at PowerBook" depending on what machine JB is logged in
from. Unfortunately, if the buddy's using another client it tends to
display something like "Joe Blow at gabber" which is less than
useful...


It would be nice if the people working on the other clients could take
the time to fix this. It only took me a few minutes to implement my
"location name" setup dialog.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
