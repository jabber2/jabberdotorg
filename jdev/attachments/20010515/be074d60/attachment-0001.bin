I see a few more choices. There's a distinction between using the name
"Jabber" as part of a product name, vs. simply declaring the product
as "Jabber compatible" (and of course using the word "Jabber" or the
light bulb logo in the UI.)


I don't really have a problem with Jabber.com restricting the use of
Jabber in product or company names. But trying to prevent commercial
products from using the name "Jabber" to indicate compatibility would
be a horrible move that would cripple the Jabber project. Fortunately
it doesn't sound as though Jabber.com is making any such moves.


It would be fine if Jabber.com or the Jabber Foundation want to
establish some kind of testing as a requirement for declaring Jabber
compatibility (the way Sun has done with Java) but as others have
pointed out, it's going to be quite a while before the Jabber
protocols are well enough defined for that to be possible. (I for one
would be overjoyed if there were a rigorous compatibility spec and
test kit I could use with my client...)<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
