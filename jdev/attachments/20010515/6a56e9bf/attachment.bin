Hmm, I think you're misunderstanding what I wrote. The user is
prompted to enter <italic>her own</italic> resource name when first
running the client. It's a one-time (per machine) bit of setup that
has nothing to do with the number of buddies.


The buddy list just displays the resource names that come over the
wire ... which is why I have an interest in having other clients do
something useful with them instead of just using "gabber" or something
like that.
