Having returned from vacation I'm back to implementing
groupchat/conferencing in my client. At this point I'm still very
confused about which version of the protocol to implement. I started
by following the Group Chat Overview in the JPG, was told that was
obsolete and to use the new Generic Conferencing protocol, but was
then told by some other people that is not ready for use yet. However,
the Conferencing section of the 1.4 Server How-To, and D J Adams's
groupchat roundup document both say that the 1.4 server supports
generic conferencing.


So what's going on here? Which chat/conference protocol can I use with
the 1.4 server?


With regard to the old groupchat protocol, one thing I'm still
scratching my head over is how you <bold>create</bold> a chat room.
The JPG doesn't say anything about that, only how to enter an existing
room. Do you just make up a room name and send presence to it as
though it already existed? Or [god forbid] do rooms have to be set up
in advance by server admins?


Thanks as always,
