Has anyone written a gateway between Jabber and two-way pagers like
the hugely popular Motorola T900? These devices can apparently send
messages nearly instantly among themselves, and can send and receive
Internet email too.


It appears that the only way into the system from outside is via
email, so I guess this would really be an SMTP gateway, perhaps
similar to the one Al Sutton mentioned yesterday. I.e. an IM sent to
the device would result in the gateway talking to the service's SMTP
server, and the gateway would run its own SMTP server to accept
incoming mail that would be instantly routed via Jabber. I would guess
this would also work with cellphone text messaging (SMS) which has the
same kind of email access.


Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any any presence feature in
this system -- as far as I know, it's not possible to tell whether a
user's pager is on and in range. But the system does queue incoming
messages until the pager comes back online.


<smaller>T900 info:
<<http://www.motorola.com/GSS/CSG/direct_pagers/T900/>. I'm probably
going to buy one of these in the near future; I've held out against
cellphones but in this case the geek appeal plus the low price ($100 +
$15/month) is too much to resist. Plus, they come in translucent
colors...)
