Wait! Does this mean that it will always be impossible to determine
the actual JID of a chat participant, and all chats will be anonymous?
Will it also become impossible to browse the room and see the real
JIDs of the participants? (The draft does not mention this.)


If not, ignore the rest of this message :) and maybe you can explain
in more detail what you meant above.


If so, then I strongly, <bold>strongly</bold> disapprove of this.
Privacy can be useful if people really want to chat anonymously, but
for the most part it's nice to know who it is you're chatting with,
especially in a small chat among friends/coworkers. In particular,
this 'feature' would really turn off any company thinking about
deploying Jabber internally.


And no, setting your nick to your real name or telling people who you
are in a message isn't good enough; it's best if the <italic>client
itself</italic> knows, so it can show the correct buddy icon and
otherwise make it clear that the chat participant is the same as the
person in your buddy list. (Yes, my client does this.)<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
