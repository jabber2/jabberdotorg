I don't know which of the many T900 carriers you looked at; they all
have different pricing options. For example, WebLink Wireless has a
$20 plan with 1000 free messages a month, plus 5 cents per extra
message. (There's also a $30 plan with 2000 free messages.) They
define a "message" as "100 characters or less", so if you get a
103-character message it counts as two. This seems fairly typical of
the providers I've looked at.
