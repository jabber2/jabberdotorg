OK, I guess I've been assuming it's "done enough" since it's
implemented in the current production build of the server.


At this point would you recommend that clients continue to use the old
groupchat protocol instead, until the new protocol settles down? (I
have some #ifdefs in my code to support either one, but haven't tried
out the oldstyle support yet.)


If so, I never got an answer to my earlier question about how you
create a chatroom with the old protocol. Do you just send presence to
the address of the room you want to create?<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
