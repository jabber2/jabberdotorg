Well, that made no sense to me -- the room doesn't even
<italic>exist</italic> at this point since the "set" is what
supposedly creates it -- but I can't deny that it worked! Thanks for

Generic Conferencing draft.


Soon as I get conferencing running reasonably well I'll try to
braindump everything (in tutorial form) into the <italic>Client
Developer's Cheat Sheet</italic>. Stay tuned.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
