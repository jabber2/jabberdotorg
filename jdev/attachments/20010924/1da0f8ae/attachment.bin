This is way, way off-topic, but Raskin did <italic>not</italic> design
the Macintosh. He was the one who originally proposed and championed
building a small, all-in-one, easy-to-use "appliance" computer with a
GUI, and he gave it its name. But he left Apple in '81 or '82, years
before the Mac shipped, and he didn't play much of a role in the
actual engineering or HI design of the Mac product.


I haven't read Raskin's book, but most of the other things I've read
by him give me the impression he's a rather embittered guy with a lot
of ideas that I, frankly, consider pretty wacko. If I'm going to read
manifestoes by user-interface cranks, I'll take Ted Nelson any day --
his "Computer Lib / Dream Machines" totally changed my life in 1979.
