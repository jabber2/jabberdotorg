I think it's great that someone is paying attention to UI design, but
I doubt that this document is going to be too useful. My impression is
that developers who really care about good UI will tend to already
know the things you're pointing out (they will steal ideas from the
commercial clients, or actually do user testing, or think creatively
about how to solve UI problems), while the majority(?) of developers
for whom UI is an unpleasant chore will simply hack together something
ugly that does the job. (At the risk of starting a flame war, in my
experience nearly all Unix programmers tend to fall into the latter
category.) No design document like yours will really reach the people
who don't care about UI.


Some detailed points:


* You make the point that the client should integrate into the
operating system's GUI, but then you show Mac-style flippy triangles
for the group show/hide controls on a Windows client. For it to be
Windows-like it should use the boxed "+" and "-" things that the
generic Windows tree view uses.


* Your list of status states in Jabber is wrong. The default is called
"Available", not "None". There is no "N/A", instead you mean "XA"
("extended away", and I have yet to see any coherent description of
how this differs from regular "away".) Also, "invisible" is not
currently supported by the Jabber server; if you manually set your
presence to "unavailable" you stop receiving presence or messages.
There's also an implicit "unknown" state for people whose presence you
don't have a subscription to (presumably because they haven't approved
your request yet.)


* You don't mention one issue that bugs me about current Jabber
clients. The Jabber "resource name" is associated with a particular
login. The best usage of this is to identify the location of the
client, i.e. "work" or "laptop" or "home". For a non-PC client the
type might be useful, like "cellphone" or "T900 pager". However,
whenever I look at my buddy list it seems like most of the clients
(gabber, winjab, etc.) just use the name of the client as the resource
name. This is fairly useless -- usually I don't care what brand of
desktop client they use. It <italic>is</italic> often useful to know
whether they're at home, at work, in a cafe, whatever. IMHO the
client, when first run, should ask the user to enter a resource name,
and it should store that as a persistent preference. This type-in
field should not default to the brand name of the client; it should be
blank to encourage the user to type something meaningful.


* A related issue is how resources should be displayed in a client. If
someone's online at two locations do they show up as two people, or as
one person with two possible recipient addresses, or? Likewise, if
someone has two known JIDs should they show up as separate people in
the list or be coalesced into one?


* You might think about how the coming support for 'avatars' (pictures
of users) can be integrated into Jabber user interfaces. Where should
these be displayed? At what size? How do you configure yours? You want
to give people a range of choices. A compact buddy list(tm) is
efficient, but makes photos illegible. 64x64 photos look real pretty
but take up a lot of room.


In general I think your comments are useful, but they're not pushing
the envelope. They merely reflect the current 'best' practices of
commercial IM clients, which IMHO all suck. No one has really thought
through the issues and tried to do something better; they're all just
repeating AOL's and ICQ's mistakes.
