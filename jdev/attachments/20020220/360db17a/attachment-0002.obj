This is the new conferencing/groupchat service for the 1.4 server.

Unpack it into your 1.4 server folder, and type 'make' to build the conference.so.

Then add the following to your jabber.xml configuration file:

(NOTE: if you want this service to be accessible from other servers,
 change any 'conference.localhost' or 'private.localhost' listed below
 to a fully qualified domain name!)

Conference can be configured as a private conferencing server (no browse, all rooms locked up):

<service id='private.localhost'>
  <load><conference>./conference/conference.so</conference></load>
  <conference xmlns="jabberd:config:conference">
    <private/>
    <history>30</history>
    <vCard>
      <FN>Private Conferences</FN>
      <DESC>This service is for private conferencing rooms.</DESC>
      <URL>http://foo.bar/</URL>
    </vCard>
    <notice>
      <join> has become available</join>
      <leave> has left</leave>
      <rename> is now known as </rename>
    </notice>
  </conferece>
</service>

Add this section to the browse area of the jsm service to advertise it to your users:

    <conference type="private" jid="private.localhost" name="Private Conferencing"/>


Conference can ALSO be configured as a public chatroom server:

<service id='conference.localhost'>
  <load><conference>./conference/conference.so</conference></load>
  <conference xmlns="jabber:config:conference">
    <public/>
    <vCard>
      <FN>Public Chatrooms</FN>
      <DESC>This service is for public chatrooms.</DESC>

        <leave> gets lost</leave>
        <rename> feels it is more important to be known as </rename>
      </notice>
    </room>
