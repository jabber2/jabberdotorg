Is there a generally-used "priority" value that the various clients
use when setting presence? libjabber doesn't itself set it, nor does
everybuddy (libEBjabber.c). According to the spec, that will default
the priority to zero. I want to be well-behaved and not have my client
usurp everyone else's in the case of multiple logins.


Do any of the other clients out there use different values?

Is zero considered the default for a normal GUI client? If so, would
something like a pager have a negative priority?

Do any of the clients let the user adjust the priority?


And most importantly, is the server at all intelligent about
considering availability <italic>as well as</italic> priority — if two
online resources for the same jid both have priority
<italic>n</italic>, but one is available while the other is away or
dnd, will traffic be routed to the available one? If not, that implies
that a well behaved client should automatically lower its priority as
its status becomes less available.


Thanks,
