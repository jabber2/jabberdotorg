How does a client <italic>deny</italic> a subscription request
(incoming <<presence type=subscribe> tag)? The JPO and JPG have
nothing to say on the topic. Surely I should send
<italic>something</italic> back, otherwise the originator is just left
hanging, waiting for me to approve their subscription.


My best guess is to send back a <<presence type=unsubscribed>, but
that doesn't seem right somehow.
