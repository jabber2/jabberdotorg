Hello,

Downloaded 1.4RC for a quick play. No problems at all on RH6.2, so
looking good.

I just thought I'd point out a couple of really minor points with the
jabber.xml config file.
They don't cause any problems, but I just like being picky ;-)

The examples for setting up SSL show opening <ssl> tags, but closing
</ip> tags.
Also, (being really picky here), the SSL comments say "Except SSL is used
on the ports and ips specified."
This had me wondering for a moment what the "ips" attribute was that I
had to specify, until I realised it actually meant IP addresses <doh!/>
A really minor point, but if it can make an idiot like me pause for
thought then I'm sure it can do the same for other idiots :-)
Perhaps "ips" could be changed to "IPs" or "ip's" or even "ip addresses",
just so it reads more easily.

And now for the really really really ultra picky point. The word "amount"
is spelt "ammount" a couple of times in the Karma section :-)

Apart from that, everything's great!

Cheers,
Sean
