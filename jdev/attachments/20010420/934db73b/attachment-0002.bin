    Why did you choose it.  It's makes now sense.  You made your

Your comments here seem to pertain entirely to the use of XML for data
storage on the server, not to its use in the protocol itself. From an
architectural point of view I couldn't care less about how a
particular server implementation manages its data storage; what's
crucially important is that the <italic>protocol</italic> works well.
The protocol is what all implementations must use, and it can't be
changed easily.


Others have already pointed out that the use of XML for server-side
storage is optional. If you have opinions on a more efficient form of
storage, you are of course welcome to implement them and submit them
to the project; this is open source, after all.

Do you have actual benchmarks that indicate that performance is
"rediculous", or is this solely based on guesswork? Do your benchmarks
test both the default XML-file storage and the optional database
storage? Have you evaluated jabber.com's server, which they claim has
better performance and scalability?


Without being shown such data or even given any indication that it
exists, why are we to believe your poorly-spelled assertions?


<excerpt>I will continue

to watch your progress and I wish you luck in the future.  Without a

design, you are truly going to need it.

That's rather a rude and condescending thing to say, and since none of
us here have the faintest idea who you or "Elegant Solutions" are or
why we should trust your technical opinions, you'll hopefully
understand if we shrug our shoulders and simply toss your message in
the circular file, while awaiting future communications that show real
performance figures or suggest improved storage mechanisms.
