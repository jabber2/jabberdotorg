hello, 
this is the first time i am sending message on this list. Hope i would get a good response!!!

I am developing a jabber client in JAVA.
But when i try to connect to the jabber.org server
through socks 5 proxy....i get "authentication timed out" error.

Then i tried to run my own code on the proxy which accepts the connection from our client and forwards it to jabber server but the same error came up.

Can anyone help me out on this. This is very urgent!!

Also can we connect to jabber server through HTTP Proxy.
