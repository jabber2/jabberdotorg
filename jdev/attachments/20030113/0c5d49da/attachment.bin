I'm trying to add filters for different packets coming through I
understand that this is the class I need "<fixed>PacketRebroadcaster"


Does anyone have any examples of it in action, or know how to use it? 
I thought it was straightforward to add the class that extends
PacketRebroadcaster to the connectionbean then add listeners within
the PacketRebroadcaster class for the packet filtering classes..
