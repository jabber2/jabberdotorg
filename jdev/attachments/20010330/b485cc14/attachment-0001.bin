From my searching, there appear to be no documents on the jabber site
that seem to outline this.

My understanding (but I'm a newbie) is that you send a <<presence
type="unsubscribe"> element to the person you want to remove from your
roster. (Protocol Overview, 1.4.1.6, p.12.)


I'm basing this on the assumption that the roster is identical to the
list of people whose presence you're subscribed to, which is true in
other IM clients.

Well, on looking at the jabber:iq:roster description in the Protocol
Overview, it does say that a client can add or remove roster items
using queries with this namespace (although as you point out it
doesn't say <italic>how</italic>.) So how does this differ from
sending <<presence> elements?


I'm beginning to get the impression now that the
<italic>roster</italic> and the <italic>set of people who send me
presence</italic> are two independent entities. Is this true? If so,
how can I get an authoritative list of people whose presence I'm
subscribed to?<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
