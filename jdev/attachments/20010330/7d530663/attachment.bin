A Jabber user has to explicitly approve other users' subscribing to
their presence, which is a good privacy control. However, there
doesn't seem to be any control over one-shot <<presence type="probe">
requests. The JPO (1.4.1.2, p.10) says that the server responds to
these, which doesn't give the user's client a chance to check for
approval.


Many people are concerned about letting random other people discover
their presence status. Does Jabber provide a way to prevent
unauthorized people from polling for this information?
