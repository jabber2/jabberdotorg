I am developing an application which is assisted by Jabber IM.
I start my application and click on button to get connected to 
Server.
The buttons which deal with sending of data are disabled when the 
user
is offilne. So he cannot work ahead until he gets connected.

My need is that application should be able to save sent offline 
message to outbox folder . When user becomes online the messages 
could be sent to resp. destination cronologically.
How do i go about?
