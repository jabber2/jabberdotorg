You are probably best off contacting the author of the software. Failing
that you can always ask on jdev@jabber.org (or search the archives). You
can find information about the list at

&gt; I downloaded the JabberCE copy, and it seems to work fine, it loads and it sends text throught the server; however, on the message window it self, I can not see the text I am sending nor the text I am recieving.  Can you provide some technical assistance since I would believe I am not the only one with this problem.  Thank You.
