Hello,

I am sending the list of bugs that i found in Jabber servers.If 
these have already been reported,well and good, and if not, hope 
they will be solved soon.

1.If a gateway is removed and then added again with a different 
id, the contact list of the previous user id is visible and the 
new user id can chat with the contacts of the old user id

2.The servers do not support all the gateways at all times.

3.Change of password in the Jabber servers is not instant at all 
times.

4.The Jabber servers do not check if a contact added is a valid 
one or not in case of all gateways other than MSN.I'm not sure 
whether it is a problem with the gateways or the Jabber servers.

5.In the message dialog, sometimes the id of the contact is being 
shown whereas sometimes the nickname of the contact is shown.

6.Even though a new account gets created,sometimes the user is 
shown a message that the user already exists.This happens mostly 
in black9.net.

Regards,
Gaur.
