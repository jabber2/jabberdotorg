might think about having our own mime-type, cause it is more flexible.


We can have a application/x-jabber-control .XJC thing, which is
required to

be a special XML Document, allowing or the above things and other

like controling groupchat/conference and agents.

Personally I <italic>really</italic> dislike protocols that result in
downloading some useless little temporary file to your desktop (like
all those damn ".pls" MP3 streaming playlist files.)


I'd much rather add a query to the URL indicating the action:


jabber:snej@jabber.org?action=message   # send IM (default action)

jabber:snej@jabber.org?action=roster   # add to roster


jabber:jdev@conference.jabber.org?action=chat   # join a chat room


As I said, I recall that this is how AIM URLs work.
