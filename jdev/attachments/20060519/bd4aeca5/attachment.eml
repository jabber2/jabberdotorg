&gt; Jabber works using direct childs of the root element as the unit of
&gt; communication, not the whole document. Entities basically open a TCP
&gt; connection and then during the whole session (which may last days or
&gt; even longer) two XML documents are being exchanged. One in each
&gt; direction.

As I have seen, most jabber libraries have SAX parser to split it into
the stanzas (these child elements) and there is something like semi-dom
something to take care of each one. And I guess there will not be much
difference in the parsers, if it is already split up and built to some
kind of tree, or joined to gether and passed to any special parser to
parse it again. And anyway, these pars are rather small - usually few
bytes.

Work with computer has 2 phases. First, computer waits for the user to tell=
 it what=20
to do, then the user waits for the computer to do it. Therefore, computer w=
ork=20
consists mostly of waiting.
