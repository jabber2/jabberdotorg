As far as I can tell from reading the docs, yes you do. The only way
described for either the client or server to specify deletion is to
set the "subscription" attribute to "remove", which then removes the
entire roster item. [This isn't mentioned in the JPO but is in the
JPG. Peter says he's going to update the JPO ASAP.]


Since there's apparently no way to specify deletion of individual bits
inside a roster item, I have to assume that a roster item completely
replaces the previous contents of the item, so you have to send over a
whole new copy (minus the data you wanted deleted.)
