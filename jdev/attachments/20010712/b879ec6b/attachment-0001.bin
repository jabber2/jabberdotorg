I've been fine-tuning my client's file-transfer (jabber:x:oob)
implementation, including the ability to send files/URLs in groupchat
messages. Unfortunately I quickly discovered that the conference
server often, but not always, removes the contents of the <<url>
element, i.e. the URL itself, when relaying the message. The really
weird thing is that this consistently happens on one of my machines
but not the other, even though both are running the identical client
binary, nor does it matter which of them sent the message or created
the chat room.


I've verified this by dumping the raw XML sent/received by the clients
(though the sample XML below is just something I made up, since I'm
writing this from home and don't have those logs handy right now.
Don't flame me if there are syntax errors.)


For example one client might send this:

<fontfamily><param>Courier</param><smaller><<message type="groupchat"
to="mychat@conf.domain.com">

<<body>Everyone, check this out<</body>

<<x xmlns="jabber:x:oob"><<url>http://www.foobar.com<</url><</x>

<</message>

</smaller></fontfamily>

But the other client would receive from the conference server:

<fontfamily><param>Courier</param><smaller><<message type="groupchat"
from="mychat@conf.domain.com/5789578957239857">

<<body>Everyone, check this out<</body>

<<x xmlns="jabber:x:oob"><<url><</url><</x>

<</message>

</smaller></fontfamily>

As a workaround I now have the sender add a duplicate copy of the URL
as a 'url' attribute of the <<url> element, then the receiver tries to
find this if the body of the <<url> is empty.


Is this a known bug? I'm running the 1.4.1 conference server on
Solaris.
