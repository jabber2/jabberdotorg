If you create the conference by sending presence to it, you get the
old-style groupchat protocol, which I believe doesn't support privacy.
To get privacy you need to create the room the new way. The
conferencing draft document describes all this.

(Look under "creating a new room".)


Watch out though, the current draft of this document describes all
kinds of new features that I don't think have even been implemented
yet! As far as I know there's no current document that describes just
what exists today in 1.4.x.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
