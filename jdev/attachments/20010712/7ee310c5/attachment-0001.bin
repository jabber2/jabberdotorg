indicates they should be removed from the users roster.

These may be undocumented in the "Protocol-standard" document, but
they're covered in the "jabber:iq:roster" section of the
<italic>Jabber Protocol Overview</italic>, and also in my
<italic>Jabber Client Developer's Cheat Sheet</italic>.


It's definitely a problem that none of the documentation is
comprehensive. I had to develop my own client (and write my
cheat-sheet) by having printouts of both the JPO and JPG open in front
of me and constantly flipping back and forth between them. (And to get
conferencing working, I had to go to the protocol-draft document for
that, since the stuff in both of the previously mentioned documents is
out of date.)
