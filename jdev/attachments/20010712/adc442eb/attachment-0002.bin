I have noticed that status messages (i.e. <<status> elements in a
<<presence> element) containing a quote character are truncated before
that character — but only when forwarded by the server upon client
login, not when they're sent in real time to an already logged in
client. 


I've verified that my client <italic>sends</italic> XML metachars
properly to the server, and that the problem exists in the raw XML
received by the client, not in my XML parsing.


This is with the 1.4.1 server running on Solaris. Anyone else seen
this?
