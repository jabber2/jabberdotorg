Correct.


<excerpt>Have any of the architects/developers considered using

binary XML as defined in the Wireless Access Protocol(WAP)
specification?   It

would save transmission bandwidth but are there other disadvantages to
using it?

It's been a while since I read the binary XML spec, but from what I
recall, there is a header at the beginning that establishes a
dictionary for tokenizing the XML element and attribute names used in
the file. If that's true and it's <italic>required</italic> that all
names appear in this dictionary, then the protocol wouldn't work for
an open-ended stream as used by Jabber, since you couldn't know when
the stream was opened what keywords might be used in it later on.


Otherwise this might be very interesting to look into. It should be a
lot simpler to parse than regular XML, and will send fewer bytes over
the wire, both of which would be good for small wireless clients like
phones and PDAs (after all, that's why the WAP people invented it.)


Incidentally I've heard both of these issues (primarily the parsing
overhead) mentioned as problems with Jabber -- "oh, won't Jabber be
really slow since you have to parse all that XML?"


Could you post a URL for the binary XML spec so we can [re]read it?


BTW, I suggest we continue this thread on the protocol list instead of
jdev. (I've set the reply-to header accordingly.)
