Yes, but the binary data would already be compressed much further than ASCII
could be. For example, the tokenization would compress a long attribute name
like "jabber:iq:conference" down to something like two bytes.

One has to assume that the WAP people considered general compression vs.
tokenization, and that they went with the latter because it offered better
compression.
