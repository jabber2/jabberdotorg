I found the W3C spec for binary XML:


http://www.w3.org/TR/wbxml/


I've only spent a few minutes skimming it; here are my findings:


* It is <italic>not</italic> hardwired to any particular DTD. It can
be used for any XML document and preserves the full semantics of XML.

* Most tag and attribute names get tokenized to single bytes. A set of
token IDs can be defined for a particular DTD to avoid having to
define them in the token table in every document. This clearly offers
very high compression.

* It's definitely possible for a particular document to include its
own string table to define additional tokens.

* It <italic>appears</italic> possible to define tokens inline, which
would allow you to use a particular tag or attribute name without
having to predeclare it at the start of the stream (but since the name
has to appear inline every time it's used, you don't save any space.)


I think this is definitely worth considering for Jabber. It should
allow us to make the stream data much, much smaller and considerably
simplify parsing.
