Yes, but the binary data would already be compressed much further than
ASCII could be. For example, the tokenization would compress a long
attribute name like "jabber:iq:conference" down to something like two
bytes.


One has to assume that the WAP people considered general compression
vs. tokenization, and that they went with the latter because it
offered better compression. <color><param>0000,0000,DEB6</param>
