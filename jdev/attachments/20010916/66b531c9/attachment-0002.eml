Subject: Open Source in Banking and Finance-- Workshop in
	Baltimore on November 9th
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot; ; format=&quot;flowed&quot;


The website for the Open Source in Banking and Finance workshop is 
now up and running. (http://www.osbaf.com) This will be a one-day 
workshop aimed at bringing together people interested in on using 
open source software in such a competitive and collaborative 
industry. Open source toolkits shared between banks are an ideal 
mechanism for creating and sustaining the cross-industry mechanisms. 
Banks need to communicate with their competitors and open source is a 
good way to negotiate the process.

The morning will include panels aimed at the more abstract questions 
of ownership while the afternoon will focus on more concrete 
questions about implementations. Eric Raymond, the author of &quot;The 
Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;, will give a keynote address at lunch. I'm 
personally looking forward to hearing his thoughts because he's 
always shown a good eye for how people and systems evolve and thrive.

The schedule is still tentative and evolving. I know of at least one 
panel that might be added to the program. If anyone interested in 
attending has a good idea for a panel, please don't hesitate to 
contact me.

Please visit the website and consider participating. Let me know if 
you have any other ideas.
