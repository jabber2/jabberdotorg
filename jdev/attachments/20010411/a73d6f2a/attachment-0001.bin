Precisely, which brings us back to the subject of this thread. I guess
the conclusion here is that clients should either default to blocking
messages from non-buddies, or should when first run ask the user if
s/he wants to accept messages from non-buddies, with the default
answer being "no".

This is a wider issue. Blocking all non-buddies is pretty severe. It
<italic>might</italic> be enough to also accept messages from people
who have you on <italic>their</italic> buddy list, since you
presumably approved their doing so. The loophole I can see here is
that you could end up getting spammed with subscription requests like
"The user hotbabe@sexxx.com wants to add you to their buddy list. Do
you approve this?"


One big vague architectural solution is to establish some kind of "web
of trust" where transitive buddyhood (foo@bar.com is unknown to me but
is on one of my buddy's buddy lists) is used as a heuristic to guess
that someone is legit and therefore not block their messages. The
problem is how to trawl through the directed graph of buddy lists
without privacy concerns coming up, since I don't necessarily want all
my buddies knowing who else is on my buddy list.


Here's a quick thought: Allow each user to keep a private server-side
list that rates other users positively or negatively. Other users can
then send special messages to your server to query for your rating of
a single other user. By sending such a query to your whole buddy list,
you can compute an aggregate ranking that gives you an idea of whether
or not to trust or block some unknown user. Should be quite simple to
implement...<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
