creating a new JID?

We might just see a lot of one-time JIDs pop up as happens with email
spam

now.

If Jabber really takes off, someone will create a special Jabber
server for spammers, which just sends every message from a different
randomized fake JID. Although at least, with server-server dialback,
they won't be able to fake the server name on their messages (right?)


For this and other reasons I would rather see trust as "opt-in", i.e.
people will be blocked unless there is a reason to consider them
trustworthy. Or if not blocked completely, then at least downgraded in
importance, i.e. messages from them don't pop up on your screen but
just get added to a list in a window that you can open once in a while
and look through. Sort of like the "Junk?" mailbox that my mail rules
throw suspicious messages into.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
