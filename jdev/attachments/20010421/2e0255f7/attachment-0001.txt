Hi,

does Jabber right now support the following things:

1. events:
onReceive -> we are getting a message
afterReceive -> we received a message
beforeSend -> before send a message to the user
afterSend -> we send a message
onLogin -> a User login
onLogout -> a User logs out
afterRegistration -> anew User comes

2. If such a event occurs, can I call a PHP or PERL-script ?

3. Can I send messages to some users only 
4. Can I send / define my own messagtypes (receive and send) for e.g. format control (Color, Font....).
5. Some messages should only be visible as Textmessages
6. Self defined "Systemmessages" must be sendable to the clients but only to some clients (dynamic). Data are stored e.g in MySQL.
7. Usermessages are send only to special user (e. g. conferencing)
8. "God-mode" for Administrator


Thank you very much for a fast reply

Best regards

Ulrich Eckardt
