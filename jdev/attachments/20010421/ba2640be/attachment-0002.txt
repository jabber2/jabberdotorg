Hi,

I'm brand new here and would like to know if there is a possibility to start a script e.g. php or perl when jabber receives a request or / and send a message via jabber created by PHP.
The thing is I would like to create an online RPG and need some information stored in a MySQL DB, The information (Skill, Level, Alaisname, Position on Map...) must be send to a Win Client.

Thank you for your reply.

Best regards

Uli
