Yes. They're easier for the client and server to implement. That's
about the only advantage.


(My client started out using plaintext; it took me a few hours to get
digest working, mostly because I had to read the man pages for OS X's
hashing APIs and because I didn't realize that "SHA-1" and "SHA" are
not the same thing.)


By the way, could you get your mailer to stop hardcoding <<font
size=2> on your messages? That makes the text really tiny and hard to
read.
