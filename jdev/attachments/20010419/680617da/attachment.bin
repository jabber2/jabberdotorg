There are many jabber.org mailing lists for other topics. A good
fraction of the traffic here seems to be from people trying to build
and/or run the Jabber server -- that's what the <bold>jadmin</bold>
list is for. <bold>jdev</bold> is supposed to be focused more on
<italic>development</italic>, i.e. people trying to write code and/or
work with the protocol.
