1# had netdetect and  auto login  2# simple

accounts  and contact list. 


Then, I could keep my icq, be seen in aol, 
and, get messages from  aol users.  Just 
need to get my computer illiterate sister to  
run the  widget (with autoconnect and 
webdetect). <color><param>0100,0100,0100</param><smaller><smaller>
