I've made my client send <<presence> packets as a way of "meeting" up,
in order to avoid having to look at rosters.  So it's certainly
possible to get around with presence, using a standard jabber server
(public) and personal jabber server.


News to me that its blocked, been testing it all along jabber.org
maybe if the server implements some rules then I guess it would be
mediated.

questions about directed presence and roster control. The
documentation states that a node can choose to manage its presence

independent of roster membership. Some implementers have, however,
warned us that this is not the case: that presence dissemination is
both mediated and blocked by the server according to roster.</smaller></fontfamily>
