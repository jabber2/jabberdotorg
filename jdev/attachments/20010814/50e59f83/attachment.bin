How does the negotiation work to determine which (if any) side is not

You seem to be assuming there will be one global server for everyone,
which I agree doesn't make sense. But just about anyone with an
account at an ISP has their own FTP area with at least 5MB of space.
(You pretty much have to have this, or WebDAV, to be able to host a
web page, which is a feature of all but the most basic ISP accounts.)
So nearly everyone has access to such a server. The problem is that
you have to configure your Jabber client by giving it the correct
protocol and address, which is a hassle.
