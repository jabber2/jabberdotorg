&gt; Some question that has arisen during my work with the protocol.
&gt; They're not very pressing, just my musings and some unclear issues.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Are we allowed to put subsessions within a session? Eg
&gt; 
&gt;    &lt;jabber&gt;
&gt;      &lt;login&gt;&lt;user&gt;svempa&lt;/user&gt;...&lt;/login&gt;
&gt;      &lt;message&gt;...&lt;/message&gt;
&gt;      &lt;jabber&gt;
&gt;        &lt;login&gt;&lt;user&gt;nisse&lt;/user&gt;...&lt;/login&gt;
&gt;        &lt;message&gt;...&lt;/message&gt;
&gt;      &lt;/jabber&gt;
&gt;    &lt;/jabber&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;    Don't know if there's any point in this. Anyone sees a use?
&gt; 

A while ago I was thinking about using subsessions with encryption. 

&gt; 2. We should stipulate that the &lt;login&gt;&lt;user&gt;&lt;/user&gt;&lt;/login&gt; always
&gt;    contains the user's whole address including domain. This would make
&gt;    it possible to create transparent proxies.
&gt; 

I always thought we did anyway. ;)

&gt; 3. Current examples enters addresses for other transports as
&gt;    12341424@ICQ. I'd like to propose the less ambiguous form
&gt;    icq:12312313. This will take care of the fact that someone else may
&gt;    come up with the same scheme as we have. Of course, pedants may use
&gt;    jabber:user@blah.org. Incidentally, we now have a subset uf the URI
&gt;    standard. 
&gt; 
&gt;    This will conflict with current description which allows special
&gt;    characters in the ID. These should then be escaped in accordance
&gt;    with URI standard.
&gt; 

I've taken your idea one more step and have began writing a document for a
full URL-based UID system. It goes along the lines of
&lt;transport&gt;://&lt;server&gt;/&lt;transport specific&gt;. For example, the UID
12341234@ICQ coming from a transport at jabber.org would be
icq://jabber.org/12341234. scott@tranzoa.com would be
jabber://tranzoa.com/scott. Some multi-guise stuff I've been working on
works like: guise://tranzoa.com/123/scott where the user# 123 has a guise
named &quot;scott&quot;.

I've included routing information because of the cases of
multiple-transports and cross-server communication. The main ICQ network is
not the only one. They've released intranet versions. Many other chat
systems have as well.

&gt; 4. According to various example docs (eg
&gt;    docs.jabber.org/overview.html) the sender's server is responsible
&gt;    for storing messages until recipient is back online. Like this:
&gt; 
&gt;       Message &gt;&gt; Client &gt;&gt; Server &gt;&gt; Offline storage
&gt; 
&gt;    Rather than:
&gt; 
&gt;       Message &gt;&gt; Client &gt;&gt; Server &gt;&gt; Server &gt;&gt; Offline storage
&gt; 
&gt;    Is this how we want it?
&gt; 
&gt;    + Storage closer to sender == easier to stop/punish abusers: it's
&gt;      *my* disk gets full, so I either train my users or pay for more
&gt;      disk.
&gt; 
&gt;    - Propagation/polling of status will increase traffic.
&gt; 

We gotta assume that with the size the Jabber network can become,
propagation/polling will not be a factor. Anyway, it's how SMTP works.
(sometimes)

&gt; 5. Overview says:
&gt; 
&gt;    Each &quot;user&quot; has multiple &quot;sessions&quot; 
&gt;        Every connection to a Jabber server can be &quot;addressed&quot;
&gt;        uniquely. This allows every user to connect multiple times, or
&gt;        use their account from
&gt;        several locations(home and work), and still be able to
&gt;        send/recieve messages at any one of the locations uniquely. 
&gt; 
&gt;    How is this identification/addressing done? If a user is running
&gt;    two different sessions, which one do we send status &amp; messages to?
&gt; 

Take a look at http://docs.jabber.org/protocol/multiclient.txt

&gt; 6. Receipts and confirmations. The current protocol examples does not
&gt;    include any mechanisms for receipts or confirmations that an XML
&gt;    fragment has been received. Is this intentional?
&gt; 

If your message is NOT received (error in transport) then you get an error.
Receipts of reading should be handled client-side, though a recommended
practice document couldn't hurt.

&gt; That's all for now.
