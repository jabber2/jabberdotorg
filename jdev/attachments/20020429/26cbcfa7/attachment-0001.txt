Hi All,

I have installed jabber-1.4.2 and msn-transport-1.1 in my system. 
I am writting my own client and i'm having  problem when i try to 
add MSN contact. I send the following strings to jabber, but the 
contact does not get a request for subscription.

<iq id="JCOM_7" type="set"><query xmlns="jabber:iq:roster"><item 
jid="jack%hotmail.com@msn.mydomain" name="jack"/></query></iq>

<presence to="jack%hotmail.com@msn.mydomain" 
type="subscribe"><status>Normal Subscription 
Request</status></presence>

Is the string i'm sending to jabber right or am i missing 
something out. I tried using the Winjab client and was able to add 
an msn contact without any problem. They seem to be sending the 
same sting. It work for winjab but not for me. Can someone help me 
with this please. I sure there r lots of people out there who have 
written their own client. So, please help me somebody.

Thanks a lot.
