Yes, although qualified with "this generally means..." and "most
clients should recognize this as..." As I recall, there were always
differences between how browsers interpreted these. But I suppose if
everyone implementing HTML support in Jabber clients is cribbing from
this particular document, they'll all interpret these tags the same
way :-)


Bold and italic are nice, but this still leaves open the issue of
fonts, point sizes and colors. Otherwise it's a flashback to 1993 and
Mosaic 1.0.


At this point I'm planning to use <<em> and <<strong> but also use
<<u> and <<font> as necessary. (And I'll parse <<b> and <<i> if I
receive 'em.) Cellphones can just ignore them.
