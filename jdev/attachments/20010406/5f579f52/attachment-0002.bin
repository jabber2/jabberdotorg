This seems similar to the issue with jabber:x:oob. You want to
establish a connection to send some data, so you send someone an IP
address and port number encapsulated in a URL. In the basic case
you're sending your own address and the number of a port that your
Jabber client just opened, but it's conceivable that some intermediate
server could get involved as a reflector to get through firewalls/NAT.


So it seems you could initiate a NetMeeting / videoconference /
whatever session by sending a particular message with an oob element
that contains your IP address. You'd need some distinctive URL scheme
— like "netmeeting:" or whatever instead of "http:" — to let the
receiver know what sort of connection you want to open.


So in short it's not possible to <italic>find</italic> another Jabber
client's IP address, but it's possible to <italic>reveal</italic> your
own to that other client.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
