If I can remember the terminology, it's well-formed XML but not valid
since those tags aren't defined in the DTD. But no one is going to run
a validating XML parser in a Jabber implementation, so I don't think
it'll be noticed...


Sounds like I'll need to be able to parse <<b> and <<i> but now that I
see the stylesheet stuff farther down in the document (so
<italic>that's</italic> what that skinny widget on the right side of
the browser window is for!) I'll probably end up sending style data
that way for better validity.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
