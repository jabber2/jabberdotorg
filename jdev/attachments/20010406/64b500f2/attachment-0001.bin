How does the Jabber protocol deal with the unexpected disconnection of
a client or server? I'm referring not to a process crash, but to
unlikely situations like kernel panic or power failure, as well as
more likely ones like network failure (modem hangs up, PacBell's DSL
network horks, laptop moves out of 802.11 range, baby yanks out
Ethernet plug, etc.)


According to R. Stevens' <italic>Unix Network Programming, vol.
1</italic> (pp.185-186), this situation is not detectable unless the
SO_KEEPALIVE socket option is set. (But libjabber doesn't set this
option.) And even keepalive only detects it after two hours, which is
rather too long for a real-time presence protocol.


Some other presence protocols solve this by requiring the client to
send a "noop" or "ping" command every few minutes, which the server
must respond to. Jabber doesn't seem to have anything equivalent. Am I
missing or misunderstanding something, or is this an issue with the
current Jabber protocol?
