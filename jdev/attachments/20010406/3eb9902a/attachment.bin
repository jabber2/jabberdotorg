Oho. Stevens mentions this on p.201 — setting the timeout requires a
new option: "TCP_KEEPALIVE ... is new with Posix.1g." He says it's
"not widely implemented", which had caused me to ignore it, but the
book is (C)1998 so perhaps things have moved forwards since then.


Does anyone know if the Jabber server uses this option? Should
clients? What timeout?
