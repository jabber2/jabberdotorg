Over the weekend I wrote some documentation on how to write a Jabber
client (rather, the back end of one.) It's an overview that mostly
links to material in the JPO and JPG but collates it in a sequence
that's more tutorial rather than reference in form. It also clears up
some areas that are left very vague in the official docs (e.g. roster
management) thanks to the helpful answers I got on this mailing list.

This is a supplement to, not a replacement for, the official docs, and
in fact I'd be more than happy if some of its organization or content
got folded into future revs of the JPO.


Since this is a first draft and since I'm a Jabber newbie (although
one who has gotten his own client up and limping) it's likely that
there are errors. If you see anything wrong or have any other
feedback, I'd like to hear from you. (Definitely on the to-do list:
converting the JPO and JPG references into hyperlinks.)
