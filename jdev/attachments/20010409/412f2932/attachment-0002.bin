SSL is already supported in the protocol, and I thought that the
server already implemented it?


But SSL does nothing to protect you from a rogue or compromised
server. You also have no guarantee that any server<<->server links
used to deliver your message use SSL.


As far as I can tell, encrypting the message is the only way to
guarantee end-to-end security. The protocol supports this but
unfortunately the documentation is awfully vague. It doesn't say how
the message specifies what it was encrypted with (is it just hardcoded
to use PGP and only PGP???) or how the sender obtains the receiver's
public key (from a vCard perhaps?)<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
