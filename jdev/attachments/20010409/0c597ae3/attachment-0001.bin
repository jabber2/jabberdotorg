agree the TCP keepalive on the server might be more elegant, but this

I have never used keepalive, but from what I read in the Stevens book,
it sounds as though I can use it in my client without the server
needing to use it too. After enough idle time my TCP stack will send
"a TCP segment to which the [server] must respond" with an ACK or RST.


It <italic>would</italic> also be nice for the server to use keepalive
so it can detect if a client crashes or loses connectivity, which is
after all much more likely, but I think I can unilaterally use
keepalive in my client. Is anyone planning to add it to the server?
