Yes. You didn't send an XML header before your open "<<stream>" tag.
You were probably copying from the <italic>Jabber Protocol
Overview</italic> which makes the same mistake on page 2. The
<italic>Jabber Programmer's Guide</italic> shows the correct login
sequence on page 25 (and so does <<plug>my <italic>Client Developer's
Cheat Sheet</italic><</plug> that I just announced here today.)


The header you need to start with is:

<fixed><smaller>    <<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

</smaller></fixed>although you could specify a different encoding if
it's more convenient for you.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>

</color>
