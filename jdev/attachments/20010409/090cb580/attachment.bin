This is a clever hack! Is there something magic about "space space tab
space space" or would any whitespace sequence work?


On the other hand, using TCP keepalive seems more efficient, since
responding to pings would involve only the TCP stack on the server and
not the Jabber server process itself. If you imagine a server with
10,000 simultaneous connections, there are going to be 167 of these
pings a second, so efficiency becomes important...<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
