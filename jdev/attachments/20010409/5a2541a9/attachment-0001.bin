that the limit for an XML node is 500k.

I would have thought sending anything over a few k would cause a big

problem for users with very slow connections (while it is being

received no other messages can get through)....

Yup. This obviously isn't an issue for buddy icons, which would be
~2kbytes.


For file xfers, at the time I suggested breaking the file into
manageable chunks (32k?) and sending them as separate elements with
sequence numbers, from which it would be really easy to reconstruct
the file at the other end. Someone objected that this is an attempt to
re-implement TCP, but it isn't since we already have a reliable
channel and out-of-order delivery isn't a problem.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
