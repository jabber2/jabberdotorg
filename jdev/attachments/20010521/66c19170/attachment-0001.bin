By the way, speaking of Mac OS X (as Max was), on that platform (and
maybe others) you don't need to use any of the SHA source code from
libjabber -- just use the OpenSSL library already in the system. Try
"man EVP_DigestInit" to get started. Just remember to choose SHA1 and
not SHA as the algorithm, as they are not the same thing (this messed
me up for a few hours!)
