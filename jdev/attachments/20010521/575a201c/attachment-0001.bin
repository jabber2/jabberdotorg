The conference/groupchat server will post user-visible messages about
people joining/leaving the chat room, e.g. "jens has arrived." These
are problematic for several reasons:


(1) They are localized by the server, not the client, so they don't
necessarily match the language used by the client or by the rest of
the conversation in the chat room.

(2) They refer to people by their nicknames; by contrast, my client is
going to make efforts to look up real names and use those in its UI
whenever possible (unless the chat room disallows this.)

(3) They assume the client's GUI wants to use text messages to
indicate people joining or leaving.  While this is true of the boring
old textual chat UI that everyone uses, I have different ideas and
these messages are getting in my way.


For the above reasons I would like my client to just ignore these
messages and manage its own UI for showing people joining/leaving.
However, I'm worried that the server may send out messages for other
reasons either now or in the future. Are there any other types of
messages that the chat room sends by itself, which I may not want to
drop on the floor and kick into the corner?
