This reminds me of an issue I've had regarding <message> stanzas.  Since you 
can have multiple top-level children with different namespaces, this leads to 
a lot of different possibilities for processing a message, particularly uses 
that are non-IM.  For instance, what if you get an RPC call like in your 
example that contains a <body>.  Does the client perform the function, 
display the body, or both?  I don't think this is defined anywhere.

I think we should have some sort of guideline that developers should follow.  
Here is what I came up with:

1) If there are any 'attribute' elements like x:delay, <amp>, etc, then these 
can be accounted for as they apply to any kind of message.

2) If there are elements recognized by the client as non-IM (such as IBB data 
or a chat state change), then the client should process the stanza in this 
way.  If there are multiple such elements, then only one kind of processing 
should be performed.  Which one to choose would be implementation specific, 
but probably picking the first one recognized would be fine.  End.

3) If there are elements recognized by the client as text, such as <body> or 
<html>, then the message should be considered an IM.

4) However, if there are elements recognized by the client as 
psuedo-attachments, such as contact items, groupchat invites, x:oob urls, 
then these can be processed as either an IM (with empty body if <body> is not 
present), or in a special way.

What do others think?
