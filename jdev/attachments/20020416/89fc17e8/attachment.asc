Hi,

I have jabber running on one of my servers with all of my users 
and their xml in this server. Is it possible for me to run a MSN 
transport on a differnt server which connects to this server and 
accesses the users xml and provide them with all the features that 
MSN has to offer. I'm new to jabber and would like to know if this 
is possible. I know that running them as separate processes works. 
But is it posible to run them on different servers. If someone has 
already done this it would be great if you could send me your xml 
or at least tell me what changes i need to make in mine.

Thanks a lot.
