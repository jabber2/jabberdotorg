In my answers here I'll assume you are talking about a transport
component dealing with a JID from multiple resources. These answers
are my opinion only.


<color><param>0000,0000,DEDE</param>Here's a couple of the questions
I'm wondering


- What is the behavior when a lower-priority resource changes presence?

</color>

The presence broadcast through the transport is always the presence of
the resource with highest priority. If a resource with lower priority
changes status, nothing changes on the transport side.



<color><param>0000,0000,DEDE</param>- What is the behavior when a
lower-priority resource changes to the highest priority, or
vice-versa? (keep in mind that some clients change priority when they
go auto-away, and any presence change within a priority level makes
that client have the highest priority)

</color>

Again, the primary presence broadcast should be the presence of the
resource with highest priority.


<color><param>0000,0000,DEDE</param>- What is the behavior when the
highest-priority resource logs out? (I'm assuming a lower-priority
resource is ignored)

</color>

The transport looks for the resource with next-highest priority and
transmits it's presence if it is different from the presence of the
resource that just logged out.



<color><param>0000,0000,DEDE</param>- How should invisible mode
interact, in both the case where the remote system does and does not
support invisible mode?

</color>

In the case where it does support invisible:

Broadcast the presence of the resource with the highest priority.


In the case where it does not support invisible:

(this one I'm not quite sure about)

Broadcast unavailable, even if lower priorities have non-invisible
status.


<color><param>0000,0000,DEDE</param>- What is the correct behavior
when a message is sent from a resource which is not the highest
priority? 

</color>

Replies should always go to the resource from which they were sent,
that said it is difficult to determine if something is a reply through
a transport. Therefore I would suggest the following:


if a message from bob@jabber.org/lowpriority is sent to a
bob@aim.jabber.org Then a message coming from bob@aim.jabber.org to
bob@jabber.org would go to bob@jabber.org/lowpriority under the
following conditions:

Only a small amount of time from the original message to the 'reply'
has elapsed

bob@jabber.org/lowpriority is still available.


otherwise it would go to the resource with highest priority.


Messages coming from all other aim users to bob@jabber.org will go to
the resource with highest priority.




I hope I was clear enough to understand.
