In this case, GPL is better than LGPL because we are supporting an
XML-based Jabber protocol in addition to the AIM and ICQ protocols.
We definitely don't want anyone who uses and modifies the Jabber
code to hide their improvements/corruptions.  The openness of the
AIM and ICQ support code is also a win over the proprietary ones.
