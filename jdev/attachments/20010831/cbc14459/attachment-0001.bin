<excerpt>What color depths should be allowed?

</excerpt>

I'm not aware of any rendering implementations that have problems with
different color depths. Everything should just get dithered if
necessary, right? (This seems like it's mostly an issue for non-PCs,
i.e. PDAs, since I can't imagine many desktop computers still use less
than 16-bit color. Still, dithering RGB color down to one-bit pixels
is hardly rocket science.)


<excerpt>Where's the bitmap support? You allow PNG but not BMP,
doesn't seem right.

</excerpt>

All of these formats are bitmaps, just with different bit depths and
compression schemes. All I know about BMP is that it's a venerable DOS
file format, but what does it bring to the table that GIF/JPEG/PNG
don't?


<excerpt>Why not use scalable graphics? Or if that's too much of a
hassle, why not

have multiple sizes of the same icon available?

</excerpt>

With scalable graphics I think the issue would be cross-platform
rendering support. I think Flash is currently the most compatible
vector format (but is there an X-windows implementation?) Adobe has
SVG viewer plug-ins for a number of platforms but I don't know how
easy they are to integrate into applications other than web browsers.
And of course there's PDF, which is trivial to render on Mac OS X but
probably more difficult on other platforms :-)


These would be nice as an option but we can hardly make it a
requirement. Many people will want to grab a picture from a webcam or
digital camera and import it as their buddy icon, which implies a
bitmap format.


<excerpt>You dropped MNG support, but is it ok to use animated GIF's?
AVI/MPEG

animations? (sounds? :-) )

</excerpt>

Animations would be interesting. Definitely too obnoxious if they were
always playing in your buddy list, but I could imagine the animation
playing only while you moused over the icon, or in a chat window when
a new message from that person appeared. GIF89 is very compatible and
fairly compact. AVI/MPEG/QuickTime/etc. are all probably too large to
be practical.


Sounds could be very useful if they were used as message alerts:
whenever you get an IM from me (in a new thread) you hear my voice
saying "Message from Jens!" (As a bonus this would teach people how to
pronounce my name...) Uncompressed 8-bit 5KHz audio (telephone
quality) runs 5kbytes/sec, which is OK for an announcement, and
various codecs can make that even smaller.


To provide multiple types (including multiple pixel sizes of image
types) we need a way for the receiver to find which types are
available and to be able to request a specific type. The latter can be
satisfied by storing each type in a separate sub-namespace (e.g.
'jaber:iq:avatar:gif-48' for a 48x48 GIF) but without browse
capability on the server you don't get the former. Perhaps that's
acceptable degradation, though.


Thoughts?
