OK, that's different from what you said before. What you actually mean
is "mailservers <italic>run for end users by ISPs or
portals</italic>", not just "mailservers". That's clearly a policy
decision for the people running the server, not a technical issue. I'm
not interested in the policy issues here; that's already covered by
various tunable settings in jabber.xml.


<excerpt>I also know that the majority of bots do not

require presence information at all, all users do is query their
services.

An IM bot is going to get added to people's rosters so they can send
messages to it, so the roster bloat will inevitably be just as you
described.


Also, the point I initially made on this thread is that if you want a
bot (like a freshmeat announcer) sending you IMs, it is a much better
model to tie this to a Jabber subscription rather than having to
invent your own higher level subscription model involving sending
magic IMs to it (whose syntax people will inevitably mess up or
forget.) Let's not introduce all the same problems that listservs have.

the scale described below?

In the case of "some random user", clearly not. As I said above, this
is a <italic>policy</italic> decision, not a technical one. In cases
where the server and the bot belong to the same organization, this
might be a fine idea.


<excerpt>I'm saying that you can't take protocol decisions made for an
average roster

size of 10 and scale it to a roster size of a quarter million.

</excerpt>

I don't see any protocol decisions here that don't scale. It sounds
like purely a server implementation issue.


<excerpt>If you are giving out a user address as the bot, it is a
user; it cannot be

farmed, it cannot be distributed. Again, it has to be attacked another
way.

</excerpt>

Again, is that an intrinsic limitation of the protocol, or just with
the design of the current server?<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
