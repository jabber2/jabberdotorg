As threatened, I've posted an updated draft of my <italic>Jabber
Client Developer's Cheat Sheet</italic>, now with an overview of how
to implement conferencing (aka chat). I've chosen to focus only on the
newer "generic conferencing" protocol, not on the old-school
"groupchat".


The URL remains:

Conferencing is quite complicated, and I've only just gotten it
working in my own client this week, so there may well be errors or
omissions! If anyone finds something wrong, let me know and I'll fix
it.
