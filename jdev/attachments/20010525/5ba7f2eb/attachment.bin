Also, Todd had written that "Jabberbot's roster on Jabber.com is about

<italic>thousands</italic>, not hundreds, of "from" subscriptions.


I still don't understand why this would be any trouble for the server.
All it means is that when the bot logs in or out, the server has to
scan its roster and send out <<presence> packets to all the
subscribers who are currently logged in (and that's probably less than
half, I'd guess.) If that brings the server to its knees, wouldn't
that imply some kind of design problem?
