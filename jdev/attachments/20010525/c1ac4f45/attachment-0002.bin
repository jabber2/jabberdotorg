It's only "improper" based on the current server implementation.
There's nothing architecturally wrong with it at all. In fact, it's
architecturally superior because it's much more modular: it allows the
bot to run on a separate machine from the server (anywhere on the
Internet in fact), doesn't require any server reconfiguration, and
will [barring scale issues] work with any conceivable Jabber server
architecture, even ones that don't have the same internal design as
the current one.


<excerpt>Thats why that bot should actually be running off of a

transport that is written specifically to handle that kind fo traffic. 
Most

likely storing the user data in some sort of in memory database, while

persisting some of the data it requires for operation to more permenent

storage.

Well, <italic>any</italic> server that plans to handle thousands of
users ought to be written that way, since it sounds as though the
current approach doesn't scale well at all. Then you wouldn't need to
use a special transport for things like this.


Why not have the server use an external SQL database for storage? That
way small installations that want to use free/open software can plug
in mySQL, while large portals can use Oracle or Sybase or whatever.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
