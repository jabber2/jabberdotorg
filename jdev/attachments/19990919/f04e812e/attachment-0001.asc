Borrowing from XML-RPC:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <methodResponse>
      <fault>
       <value>
        <struct>
         <member>

          </value>
         </member>
         <member>
          <name>faultString</name>
          <value>
           <string>roster fragment missing token x</string>
          </value>

IMHO, the Jabber protocol should be based on XML-RPC where virtual
methods in the server could be made available with a consistent
calling API.  I think this would be more straightforward and make
it easier to extend the functionality of the server later.

At the least, there should be an error element in the DTD.

It would help if the server source is readily available too, with
a caveat that the source is highly volatile (will probably change).

avoid their development environments when possible.

Please offer your thoughts on this.
