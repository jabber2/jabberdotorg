OK, now I'm really confused! I was working from the JPG and getting
mixed up about some of the examples. Then temas told me "that's old;
look at the Generic Conferencing docs instead". So I started
implementing that. But from what you're saying, it seems that it's not
implemented yet.


Also, the JPO [1.6.6] describes the jabber:iq:conference namespace for
generic conferencing, which seems to be basically the same stuff that
the proposal describes.


So if I want my client to work today with existing
groupchat/conference servers, what protocol should I implement?<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>

Could I see the new draft and perhaps comment on it? (Actually, I'm
about to leave on vacation for two weeks, so if you plan on posting it
before 5/13, just ignore this request.)


<excerpt>You could both have a non-persistant room in which the last
person out turns off the light, or a persistant room which is always
there in some form or another.

Good! Presumably the persistence is a flag specified in the
jabber:iq:conference query that creates the room?


<excerpt>One of the things I'd also like to start rolling on is an
'invitation-only'-type room. There would be an invitation list
maintained, and only people invited to the room could join.

I am <bold>very</bold> interested in such a feature. Basically, a
persistent room with invitation-only semantics where you can get a
list of all members [whether or not they're currently present] is a
big step toward a form of virtual community.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
