I had a similar problem yesterday. I solved it by recompiling adns and forcing 
it to go dynamic. Then you have to recompile libetherx. I used the following 
command to configure adns.

./configure  --enable-dynamic=elf

I can successfully ./configure and make each package, including adns and pth, but when I attempt to start the server (jserver &) several seconds pass and I get the following error : jserver: error in loading shared libraries: /usr/local/lib/libetherx.so.1: undefined symbol: adns_init
