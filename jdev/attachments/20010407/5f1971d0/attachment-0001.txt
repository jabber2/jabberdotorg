Hello,

   Hopefully someone out there is interested in implementing the Lotus/Ubique's Sametime transport. It's very popular within companies. If you're interested, here's the information I've been able to dig up:

Protocol:

http://sunsite.csi.forth.gr/sunsite/net_tools/internet-drafts/draft-houri-sametime-community-client-00.txt

Sametime servers (http access should also work):

stdemo.lotus.com
playground.ladybugbeta.com 

Sametime client (Java as well as Windows) can be downloaded from:

http://www.lotus.com/home.nsf/welcome/sametime

The 1.5 Java client works quite nicely..


Cheers...
