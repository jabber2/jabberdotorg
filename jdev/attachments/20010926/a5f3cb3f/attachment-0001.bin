In this case an event (usually a message).

That is exactly the situation described in the original message: what
to show if there's an <bold>incoming message</bold> from a user in a
collapsed group. Obviously you don't just want something flashing for
no reason.


<excerpt>Since Jabber can only have "trees" one level deep, this is
hardly an issue

(this is still true isn't it?)

</excerpt>

The trees are part of the client's UI design, <bold>not</bold> part of
Jabber. For some reason all the Jabber clients seem to have them;
personally I'm not so fond of them. The only thing related to a tree
in the protocol is that roster entries have a "group" attribute. This
is optional, and all does is establish some kind of arbitrary grouping
for roster entries. You can show this as a tree, you can show it as a
page-flipping model where you show one group at a time, you can put
each group in a separate window, you can simply use a linear list and
annotate each member with a group name. Whatever. Also note that you
could use a convention of naming groups something like
"Group/Subgroup" so a multi-level tree would be easy to support.


While we're on the topic of UI design it might be interesting to have
a discussion of what the best way is to organize / categorize buddies.
As indicated above I really don't think a tree is the only or even
best way to do this; it's just what AOL decided to do in 1996 and
everyone's copied it. For example, my client has a pop-up menu that
lets you choose which group (or all) to show, and you can also tear
off individual groups as separate windows.


<excerpt>Sorry, I was meaning *your* current resource, not the ones of
your contacts.

I agree, it's probably not important to show your resource name in the
buddy list, just in the prefs.


<excerpt>I so don't agree with that.  ICQ has so much more
functionality than the

others (in some case too much).

</excerpt>

I used ICQ for a while and saw it as fairly interchangeable with AIM.
I'd (sincerely) love to hear about what you think its particular
strengths and exclusive features are. I'm not talking about tangential
things like stock tickers, just real IM/presence functionality. We can
do this offline if you think it's more appropriate...
