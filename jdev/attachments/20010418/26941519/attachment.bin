It might be possible to provide backward compatibility if there were
consistency in how existing clients dealt with multiple
<<instructions> tags. For example, if they all use the first one and
ignore the others, then the server could send the one for the
"default" language (i.e. the language spoken in the server's host
country) first, then the ones for other languages. Older clients would
use the first one only, newer clients could pick and choose.


However, my hunch is that whether a client/library uses the first or
last instance is going to be pretty much random, depending on how the
developer decided to code that part of the parsing. Maybe the tag for
the default language could be sent <italic>both</italic> first and
last :-)<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
