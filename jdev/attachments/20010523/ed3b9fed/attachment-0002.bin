Dang! Though I suppose if we wanted to pursue this we could make our
own variant that allowed inline tag/attribute names.

Isn't that why they have the whole page-swapping thing to support
multiple single-byte namespaces for tags?

OK, that sounds reasonable. So I don't see the issue -- the binary
protocol could easily be parsed into exactly the same DOM data
structures as the textual format. All it requires is a parser with a
different front-end, which is what I meant in my last post.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB6</param>
