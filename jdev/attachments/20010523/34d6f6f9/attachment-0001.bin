probably by entering the server name in a preference dialog. Which is
exactly what people are used to from email clients: my address may be
"jens@mac.com" but I have to enter "mail.mac.com" as the IMAP host in
my account setup dialog.


But I agree it's nice for the client to be able to determine this
