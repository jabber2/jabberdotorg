There is nothing wrong with implementing a very flexible, 
not-all-that-specific protocol. Then again, when looked at from a 
users' perspective, there is, indeed, the "overwhelming need" to 
provide a common technical denominator to ensure that the corresponding 
functionality that a user sees is interoperable between as many Jabber 
clients as possible.

Therefore, IMHO, we must require a Jabber AV client to support at least 
one specified codec to ensure this interoperability.

As long as client programmers are free to choose whatever codec they 
like, you may end up in the all-too-familiar situation that you cannot 
use a certain feature because of purely techno-political reasons. Which 
is fine for geeks who will find some work-around, but it will "spoil 
the fun" for main stream users.

Consequently, I'd suggest that beyond the technical details in the 
protocol, Jabber clients and servers will be required to support at 
least one specified codec, although they'd be free to negotiate a 
different, possibly higher-quality one if both/all clients involved in 
the conference support it.

Jochen.
