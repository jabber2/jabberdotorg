There is no _technical_ need to require a certain codec, but if you 
want Jabber to also succeed as a main stream platform, a common 
denominator is indeed necessary. For a non-geek user, the beauty of, 
e.g., Apple's iChat AV is that it just works: there is no need for the 
user to configure any behind-the-scenes technical details.

To allow Jabber as a platform to provide a similarly user-friendly 
approach, the client should be able to create a video-chat connection 
without requiring user intervention (beyond initiating the call, of 
course...). Which is hard to implement if it is not ensured that all 
Jabber clients support a common standard of AV signal. Of course, there 
is no reason why clients should not _additionally_ provide further 
codecs, as long as they _also_ support a common standard.

Actually, there may be no need to modify the protocol as outlined in 
JEP-0095 at all. Still, a specification of one common standard codec 
for use in Jabber-based AV sessions should be required. Why not simply 
put this into a compliance test, similar to the XMPP ones?
