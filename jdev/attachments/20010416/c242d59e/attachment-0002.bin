That's sort of a heavyweight way to do it. When I asked the same
question last week, the most elegant solution was to simply send a
newline to the server. If no TCP acknowlegement is received, your
network stack will tell you that the connection has closed.


Alternatively you can enable TCP keepalive mode on your socket, but
setting the time interval below the default 2 hours is a relatively
new feature and may not be supported on your system.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
