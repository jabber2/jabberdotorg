hi all
       i have developed a j2me client similar to the one at 
alsutton's site. am using his xmlparser to parse the xml packets 
that i receive from the stream created from the connection to the 
jabber server. my problem is that after i send <stream:stream....> 
it gives me in reply
<?xml.....> after that i send the authentication xml for which i 
get the packet <iq type="result" id="login">
once i am authenticated i send request for agents
but i receive no reply
i've tried all possible combinations of sending 
roster,agents,presence packets.....but still no reply
is there a problem with the xmlparser ?
has anyone worked with the source at alsutton.com
plz help
