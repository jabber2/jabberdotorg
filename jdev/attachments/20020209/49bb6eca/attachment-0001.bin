I would like to write a server component that lets a client query it's
external IP address...


(this is in support of using jabber:iq:oob to do c2c stuff)


I was hoping that i could do something like:


<color><param>0000,0000,FFFF</param><<iq type="get"
id="unique"><<query xmlns='jabber:iq:ipaddr'/><</iq>


</color>and get back something like:

<color><param>0000,0000,FFFF</param>

<<iq type='result' id='unique' from='myself'><<query
xmlns='jabber:iq:ipaddr'><<item addr='192.9.9.1'><</query><</iq>


</color>I started with jud.c and started building the component, but I
can't see how to get a handle on the socket or the ip address from way
down in component land... last i could follow it was in mio
_mio_accept(mio m) in mio.c


Is this possible?
