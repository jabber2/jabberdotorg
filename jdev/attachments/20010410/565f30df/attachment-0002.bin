This looks good. I'm glad to see it piggybacking on a standard XML
encryption scheme, especially one that can contain an entire
<<message> element.


For public key exchange, why not store the key (a complete
certificate, actually) on the server using the public data space*
described in [JPO 1.6.10] (confusingly under the "jabber:iq:private"
namespace description!) Just declare a new namespace like
"jabber:public:publickey" and store your certificate in an XML
element. No new protocol needed.


The only issue I can see is that it allows anyone to get the public
key, but that shouldn't cause problems; it is after all a
<italic>public</italic> key. If only buddies could get it, you
wouldn't be able to send a signed message to a non-buddy and have them
be able to verify it.


You note that key exchange is vulnerable to attack. I think this isn't
an issue if what's exchanged is a full certificate signed by a
reputable CA, since no one could spoof such a certificate. Right?

(*In general I'm pretty excited about this public data space, which I
just discovered last night since its description is pretty well
concealed :-) In particular I think can be the solution to my earlier
issue about how to transfer buddy icons -- just store a small image
under a particular namespace, and anyone who wants to display your
picture in their buddy list can download it. There are a couple of
issues which I'll address in a proposal I plan to post ASAP.)<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
