I think you mean "jabber:iq:", since "jabber:x:" is for use in
<<message> elements.


The reason I think this is a bad idea is that, as I understand it, the
"jabber" namespace is owned by jabber.org for things that are part of
the Jabber specification. Other developers should use their own
namespaces. (Similarly, 3rd party Java developers should not use
package names starting with "java." since those are reserved by Sun.)

Oh, I'm not negative about most things, but this one really shocked
me. It's the worst-designed thing I've seen in Jabber yet.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
