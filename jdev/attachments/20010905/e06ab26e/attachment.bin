Not yet. I had to finish up implementing feature #n-1 before I could
get to this one. But I've started coding now.


<excerpt>If the avatar is *not* per-resource, all we'll have to do is
write it up in the spec that clients *must* check for an existing
avatar before uploading a new one... and show that avatar to the user.
If it *is* per-resource, we're going to waste a lot of server space. -
Unless we up the complexity one notch and have some sort of expiration
of avatars, I guess. But my vote is for the simpler method.

How much server space do we really waste? Remember that we have agreed
on an 8k limit for the pictures (and in my experience the JPEGs will
be about 2k). It takes a lot of those to eat up any meaningful amount
of storage.


I would be sad if we had to make avatars per-account. That prevents
you from doing many creative things like

- showing a picture appropriate for the location (i.e. wearing a suit
for at work, a Hawaiian shirt for at home)

- showing a different picture per state (or just for whatever reason,
like happy or sad faces)

- periodically updating your picture from a live webcam
