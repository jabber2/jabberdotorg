None that I know of. However, there was some discussion a few months
ago of the problems that the current server implementation would have
in scaling up to huge rosters. It sounds like performance would get
pretty dismal past a few thousand members, due to problems like huge
in-memory data structures, XML parsing of huge roster lists, etc.
