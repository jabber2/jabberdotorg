Look, email attachments were a bad thing.

Wow, I work on email in my day job and that's an unusual opinion I've
never heard before, even from people who generally hate MIME.

First off, even with regard to email this is not true. Most mail
clients nowadays let the recipient choose whether to download large
attachments, either by limiting the size of a POP download or by using
IMAP's more sophisticated mechanism to retrieve individual MIME bodies
on demand.


Secondly, I definitely agree with you that in-band Jabber file
transfer should <italic>never</italic> be driven by the sender. I said
this very clearly and emphatically yesterday. The
<italic>receiver</italic> should send <<iq> queries to retrieve chunks
of the attachment.


<excerpt>Instead of sending actual data around 

the jabber network, send URLs to files on a Web server. If I want to 

read your file, I'll download it.

</excerpt>

This is simply an accounting trick that wastes <italic>someone
else's</italic> disk space and network bandwidth, namely the owner of
the Web server. It's everything you said you hate about email
enclosures except that you replace the word "SMTP" with "HTTP" (or
"WebDAV"). <italic>They</italic> have to host the file for you,
regardless of whether the recipient wants it, and if the recipient
doesn't request the file immediately, the server has to hang onto it
for some unknown period of time before getting rid of it, which incurs
extra administrative overhead (they have to have some kind of daemon
nuking expired files.)


Then we also have issues of preventing abuse by imposing quotas on
users, which implies the Web server has to require you to log in to
upload, which means you have to have Yet Another Damn Account
somewhere. It also means that if you fill up your quota, you can't
send any more files to anyone until the recipient of the last one
hurries up and downloads the file ... and maybe she's watching TV
instead, or downloading over a 14.4 modem, and you'll just have to
wait the full half hour or whatever until the server expires the file
and restores your quota.


It also doubles the time to send a file since the sender has to finish
uploading it before the receiver can download it.


It also makes Jabber more confusing to set up and use. "I know you
already have a Jabber account, but you can't send me a file until you
<italic>also</italic> get an account on a WebDAV server and go through
a preference panel in your client to tell Jabber about it..."


Have I rattled off enough reasons why this is a bad idea that doesn't
actually help anything? Or should I take five minutes to come up with
some more?


If people really, really insist on using an out-of-band mechanism to
send files, please at least use one that isn't store-and-forward. As I
said earlier, the sender and receiver can open a socket to a relay
server and have the server <italic>stream</italic> the data across. 
This imposes virtually no disk or CPU overhead on the relay server,
and allows the file to be sent immediately without any forwarding
delays.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
