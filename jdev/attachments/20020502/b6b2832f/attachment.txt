Hi All,

Is there any way i can keep a log of the message that I'm sending 
through my client. Jabber maintains only the record.log (login and 
logout) and the error.log. I would like to keep track of the 
number of message that I'm sending to jabber from my client, so is 
there anyway of doing this. I wanted to know what this "Jabber 
chatbot " is all about.

Thanks a lot.
