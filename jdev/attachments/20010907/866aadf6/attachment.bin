Just thought of another, more technical, reason for per-resource
avatars.


If the avatar image is _not_ per-resource, then every connected
resource needs to know immediately when another resource changes the
image. Otherwise the next time it sent a <<presence> element it would
send out a stale hash for the old image.


However, this kind of notification won't happen by default since you
don't receive <<presence> elements from your own resources (right?). I
guess you could make it happen by adding yourself to your own roster,
but that seems kind of awkward. And there's still a potential for race
conditions if two resources try to simultaneously change the image.


It's the same fundamental thing I said in the other email: Avatar push
is done as part of presence; presence is per-resource; therefore
avatars should be per-resource.
