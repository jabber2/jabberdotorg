I'm still confused about the server-side roster. Is the roster entity
that's managed by means of jabber:iq:roster queries the same thing as
the current set of people whose presence I'm subscribed to? Or is it a
separate entity that the client needs to manually keep in sync with
subscribe requests?


That is, if I subscribe to someone's presence by sending <<presence
type=subscribe>, will the server automatically add them to my roster,
or do I also need to send an <<iq type=set> tag with a
jabber:iq:roster query? (And ditto for unsubscribing?)


<smaller>[The JPO and JPG authors might take note ... I consider this
one of the most confusing aspects of Jabber so far. It deserves to be
described in its own section, not just buried in a discussion of the
XML schema for jabber:iq:roster.]
