Perhaps someone can help me with my compilation problem.  I am trying to build the jabber server under Solaris, with poor results.  Details follow.

# uname -a
SunOS {hostname} 5.7 Generic_106541-02 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
# make
{make output}
make[1]: Entering directory `/space/gold/src/jabber-1.2/jabberd'
gcc -g -Wall -fPIC -I./ -I../  -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -D_REENTRANT -DCONFIGXML="\"jabber.xml\"" -DHOME="\"/space/gold/src/jabber-1.2\""   -c -o log.o log.c
log.c: In function `debug_log':
log.c:81: `__builtin_va_alist' undeclared (first use in this function)
log.c:81: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
log.c:81: for each function it appears in.)
log.c: In function `log_notice':
log.c:115: `__builtin_va_alist' undeclared (first use in this function)
log.c: In function `log_warn':

log.c: In function `log_alert':
log.c:139: `__builtin_va_alist' undeclared (first use in this function)
make[1]: *** [log.o] Error 1

I can see that this has something to do with the way the macro replacement of va_list and va_start are handled.  If anyone can point me in the right direction, or tell me what to do to fix this one, I would appreciate it.

Please say I'm not the only one who is having this problem...

Thanks,
