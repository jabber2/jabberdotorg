        <-- A normal MIME "mailer" would ignore this equivalent. We should,
             of course, pay attention to it. Add it to a "description"
             or something... but we should standardize on it being the
             first. Or at least have a tag. <say description>? -->
	<-- How are we handling whitespace anyway? -->
        <-- I don't have the put the length because there is no chance of a
             conflict. What would happen if some evil user put the text
             "</say></message>" in their plain-text message? What if
             somewhere it isn't escaped properly? -->

              rms, didn't we tell you to handle these weirdos?
              They seem to be worshipping you as the free software god!
              See if you can gain over this Linus character in the polls.

              This is a MIME-encoded message. If your Jabber client cannot
              understand MIME, ClientOfChoiceWithNoSpaces is a working
              alternative.
