   This may already be part of the protocol, if not... We need server-
client feature negotiation too. While not exactly "feature" 
negotiation, it'd be good if servers told clients what their upper-
limit on message size is (if they have one). And since I'm sure "our" 
Jabber server program won't be the only one and other people may 
create servers with special additional features, it'd be nice if 
servers had a way to tell clients what special additional features 
they support, and/or for clients to ask the server if it supports 
special features. Even without worrying about "special" features, 
it's be good to have a way to specify what version of Jabber protocol 
they support. Though I imagine future versions of Jabber protocol 
will be designed to degrade as gracefully as possible, it could still 
be useful...
