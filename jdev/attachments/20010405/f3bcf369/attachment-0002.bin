The JPO and JPG say that HTML content in messages should use the
"XHTML Basic" dialect. However, the spec for XHTML Basic includes
almost nothing in the way of visual formatting commands, presumably
because cellphones don't have fonts and colors. (Kind of shortsighted,
if you ask me!) So there's no <<b>, no <<i>, no <<font>. The spec does
say that stylesheets can be used to provide this kind of formatting,
which in general I'm in favor of, but I don't think that my Jabber
client should have to be able to parse stylesheets just so users can
use fonts and colors in messages.


Are there actual Jabber clients that can send/receive HTML messages?
How are they handling it? My guess is that they're likely to be
ignoring the spec and just using everyday <<b>, <<i> ...
