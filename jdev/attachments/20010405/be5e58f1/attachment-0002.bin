One one attempted login to jabber.org, my embryonic client received an
<<error> element from the server as a direct child (the first) of the
<<stream> element. My parser didn't know what to do with it. This was
several bug-fixes ago and I believe my client had not sent the
jabber:iq:auth element correctly, which would explain why the server
was sending me an error. But I need to know how to parse the error in
case this happens again!


Neither the JPO nor the JPG describe such an element nor what its
contents might be. (They only discuss <<error> as a child of
<<presence>, <<message> or <<iq>.) The only place I've seen it
mentioned at all is in the XML Streams DTD in section 5.1 of the JPG;
but this DTD appears to be truncated and doesn't describe anything
about the element other than its existence.


Unfortunately I wasn't capturing the XML to a file and I haven't been
able to reproduce this state, so I don't know the actual contents of
the <<error> the server sent.


Can anyone elaborate? For now I'm going to go on the hunch that its
contents are the same as the regular <<error> element nested in <<iq>
etc.


Peter and Thomas, you might take this as an action item to add a
description of this element to the docs.
