Dear Frank,

Hi! I am Gil from America Online.  As a Customer Care Consultant from the
TechMail Department, it is my pleasure to assist you regarding any concerns
you may have.

I want to assure you that I am here to help you resolve this issue as
quickly as possible.

I understand in your recent e-mail that you are having difficulty using AIM.

AOL is not responsible for blocking you.  It's your friendsr who is blocking
it or you blocked them.  Ask your friend to see if they have blocked you.

NOTE: Please see also in your preferences if you have not blocked anything.

If you would like to set up a special list to allow only certain members to
send you Instant Message (IM) notes, please follow the steps below:

1. On the AIM menu bar, select FILE/My AIM.

2. Select MY OPTIONS.

3. Select EDIT PREFERENCES.

This will display a new window with tabs running along the top. Select the
tab that says CONTROL.

This will take you to the section where you can set up a, 'Block' list of
members you would like to allow or members you would like to block from
sending you Instant Messages.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your time, patience
and continued support.  Please feel free to write us if you have any
inquiries, suggestions or comments regarding America Online Services.

May I reiterate my commitment to continue providing you competent and
efficient online services.

Gil F.
Customer Care Consultant
The TechMail Department
America Online, Inc.

I can't talk to my friends on it. We will have to switch away from AIM.

Please stop blocking Jabber like a child.
