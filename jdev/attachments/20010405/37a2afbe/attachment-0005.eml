Dear Frank,

Hi! I am Raymund V. from America Online (AOL).  As a Customer Care
Consultant from the TechMail Department, it is my pleasure to assist you
regarding any concerns you may have.

I understand from your recent e-mail that you have questions because you are
being blocked from sending IM's using AIM.

I sincerely apologize for the difficulties and inconvenience you are
experiencing.  I appreciate your patience regarding this problem.  I want to
assure you that I am here to help you resolve this issue as quickly as
possible.

Regarding this issue, it seems that you were unable to send IM's to your
friends. Just to remind you that the AIM software has a feature wherein AIM
subscriber could block a specific
Screen Name from sending IM if they want to. I would suggest that you
contact your friends personally by other means to verify if they have
blocked your Screen Name.

Again, my apology for the inconvenience the problem has caused you.

I hope that  the information I have provided will help. Please feel free to
write back anytime with inquiries, suggestions, questions or comments that
you may have. It has been my pleasure to assist you.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your time, patience
and continued support.

Thanks for writing America Online.  Have a great day!

Raymund V.
Customer Care Consultant
The TechMail Department
America Online Inc.

I can't talk to my friends on it. We will have to switch away from AIM.

Please stop blocking Jabber like a child.
