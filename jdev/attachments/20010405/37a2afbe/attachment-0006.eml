Dear Frank,

Hi! :-)   I am Michelle P. from America Online (AOL) .  As a Customer Care
Consultant from the TechMail Department, it is my pleasure to assist you
regarding any concerns you may have.

I apologize for the frustration that you have been experiencing. I am here
to help you find the answer quickly.

I understand from your email that you have question about AOL Instant
Messenger.

If a member of America Online has been blocked to send IM, it may mean that
the master account holder has set the Parental  Control setting or the
member was rate limited.

To learn more about rate limiting, please see below:

RATE LIMITING
Did you receive any e-mail regarding &quot;Rate Limiting&quot; from America Online?

America Online has received an overwhelming amount of complaints concerning
unsolicited commercial e-mail, or &quot;junk&quot; mail, and we are doing everything
we can to protect our members' online experience. Because many junk
e-mailers collect screen names from AOL chat rooms, we put a &quot;Rate Limit&quot;
feature in place to deter junk e-mailers from collecting member screen names
from chat rooms. The Rate Limit feature is also used to deter members from
sending mass numbers of e-mail, Instant Message notes, or Buddy Chat
invitations, which can disrupt the normal member experience.

AOL imposes a rate limit on an AOL member's account for any of the
following:

- When a member exceeds the acceptable number of Instant Message notes or
Buddy Chat invitations they send in a given time period.

- When a member exceeds the acceptable number of chat room changes or &quot;Who's
Chatting&quot; requests in a given time period.

When an account is rate limited, the ability to send Instant Message notes
and Buddy Chat invitations or to see who's chatting in a room or move from
room to room is blocked for a certain period of time or the screen name's
connection to AOL may be disconnected.

You may find that your account is rate limited if you send repeated attempts
to enter a full chat room by pressing the Enter or Space keys. Users of &quot;BPS
Power Tools,&quot; a popular chat add-on, may run into error messages if they
repeatedly attempt to get into a full chat room. AOL is working on a
solution that deters junk e-mailers while still allowing members to access
chat rooms without being rate limited.

While we are working hard to stop junk e-mailers, there are steps we also
encourage our members to take to avoid junk e-mail. For example, you can
create a screen name (Keyword: NAMES) that you use when you enter chat
rooms, then use Mail Controls to block all e-mail to that screen name. When
you want to e-mail with someone you meet in chat, give them your regular
screen name or go back to Mail Controls, select the Allow e-mail only from
selected AOL screen names, Internet domains, and addresses option and add
your friend's name.

AOL considers the sending of mass numbers of unwanted, disruptive messages
or the gathering of AOL screen names to be abusive online conduct and a
violation of AOL's Terms of Service. Rate Limits have been put in place to
curtail abuse and ensure an enjoyable online experience.

I hope that I have sufficiently provided you with useful information about
your inquiry. Should you have further questions or concerns, please feel
free to write back.  It is always been a  pleasure to assist you.   :-)

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your time, patience
and continued support.

If for any reason you need additional help or information and it entails
immediacy, may I kindly suggest you to please contact our Technical Support
Department by phone at 1-888-346-3704 or talk to our live One-On-One help by
going to Keyword ASK THE STAFF. Both departments will guide you through a
step-by-step solution to your query.

May I reiterate my commitment to continue providing you competent and
efficient online services.

Thanks for writing America Online.   Have a great day!  :-)

Michelle P.
Customer Care Consultant

I can't talk to my friends on it. We will have to switch away from AIM.
