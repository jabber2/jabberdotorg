Right; my point being that this server is part of the Yahoo IM system.
This shows a different mechanism for extending the oob namespace to
bridge firewalls. The drawbacks are that it might use a lot of disk

that it's quite specific to file transfer and doesn't allow for other
types of P2P communication. It <bold>is</bold> pretty simple, though.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
