Isn't it a type attribute of <<presence> like unavailable?

JabberBeans)


I'm trying to send a <<presence> packet to another client (in my
effort to avoid rosters - which are pointless for my client), In
constructing

the <<presence> packet to send to a specified address, I've tried
adding the type = 'available' but when I look at the debug, this is
never sent or received. But the presence packet is:


REC: <<presence to="adrian2000@jabber.org"
from="adrianxp@jabber.org/work" id="p1"><</presence>


Anyone have any ideas?


<fixed><bigger>pb.reset();


pb.setToAddress( UserJIDKit.getRemoteJID() );


pb.setType( "available" );// this doesnt get added to the packet,
can't work out why?


pb.setIdentifier( "p1" );


try {


cb.send( pb.build() );


System.out.println( "Subscribing" );


}


catch( InstantiationException e ) {


System.out.println( "Could not subscribe" );


}


}


Thanks!</bigger></fixed>
