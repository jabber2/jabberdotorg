I'm trying to send a <<presence> packet to another client (in my
effort to avoid rosters - which are pointless for my client), In
constructing

the  <<presence> packet to send to a specified address, I've tried
adding the type = 'available' but when I look at the debug, this is
never sent or received.  But the presence packet is:


REC: <<presence to="adrian2000@jabber.org"
from="adrianxp@jabber.org/work" id="p1"><</presence>


Anyone have any ideas?


<fixed>        pb.reset();

   

        pb.setToAddress( UserJIDKit.getRemoteJID() );

        

        pb.setType(
<color><param>8989,1313,1515</param>"available"</color> );// this
doesnt get added to the packet, can't work out why?

     

	pb.setIdentifier( "p1" );


        <color><param>7676,0F0F,5050</param>try</color> {

        

            cb.send( pb.build() );

            

            System.out.println(
<color><param>8989,1313,1515</param>"Subscribing" ); </color>

       

       }

       

       <color><param>7676,0F0F,5050</param>catch</color>(
InstantiationException e ) {

       

            System.out.println(
<color><param>8989,1313,1515</param>"Could not subscribe" );</color>

        

        }

    

     }


Thanks!</fixed>
