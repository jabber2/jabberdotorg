I've got a question regarding nonstandard IQ queries, i.e. ones where
I make up my own namespace that is not already known to the server.
According to the "Generic XML Namespace Storage" draft document, such
queries will get or set XML data <italic>stored on the server</italic>
per-client: "If the client does an iq set in any XML namespace to the
server, it is stored on that users account. That XML is then
accessible to anyone doing an iq get with the same namespace to that
user account." <<http://docs.jabber.org/draft-proto/html/xml.html>


This is great in some circumstances. But what if I want to define
queries that are "live" and go directly to the client? (Isn't that
what the JAM project is all about?) How do I control who resolves the
query?
