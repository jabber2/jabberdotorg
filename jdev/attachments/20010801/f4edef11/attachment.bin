OK, I'm totally confused now. Does Jeremie's draft describe what
actually exists in the server now, or is it just some hypothetical
thing? If the latter, then what happens <italic>today</italic> if I
send a get request with a namespace that's not known to the server?


I have no interest in writing a server-side module, I just want to
define a protocol extension that instances of my client can use.
Please don't tell me that the server has to be hacked whenever clients
want to use a new namespace to communicate with each other!<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
