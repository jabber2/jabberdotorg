In general the error mechanism seems OK -- most places where the
<<error> element appears it has a numeric code as well as a message.
The error number is only missing in the top-level <<error> sent when
you get disconnected.


I think it's been mentioned before that it would be nice if the server
knew the client's preferred language so that it could try to send
error messages in that language. The language code could be an
attribute sent by the client when it logs in.

clients use.  The one I like the most is a geometrically increasing

reconnect timer.

That's a good idea. I'll try to remember to put it in my cheat sheet
when I add a subsection on reconnecting.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
