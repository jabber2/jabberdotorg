I love the idea of presence/IM based services like this, but I'm
worried that we're going to get into a real mess where they're all
driven by text messages using various different syntaxes ... which is
of course exactly what happened in the e-mail world with list servers.
(I just read a news article yesterday about a new AIM based agent for
Radiohead fans that sounds like it's running some kind of Eliza-like
"natural language" interface. Be very afraid.)


In the case of your personalbuddy, I can easily see people later
deciding they don't want the notifications anymore but not being able
to remember the magic "ignore" command. They'd then get mad at the
agent for spamming them.<color><param>0000,0000,DEDE</param>

Wouldn't it be cleaner to use the existing Jabber subscription model
for this rather than inventing your own? I.e. you subscribe to
"xxxxx@alsutton.com"'s status and it will send you messages when xxxxx
is updated. To stop getting updates, unsubscribe. (The status message
in the presence could indicate the current version number.)


Of course this requires that you run your own Jabber server at
alsutton.com, which you might not be willing or able to do. Is it
possible in Jabber to subscribe to a single resource? If so, then
perhaps people could subscribe to "personalbuddy@jabber.com/xxxxx" to
get notifications for package xxxxx.
