roster on Jabber.com is about 10 times the size of the next largest
user's roster.  Whenever Jabberbot tries to log in now, it causes all
kinds of server mayhem because every presence change causes the server
to go read and parse rosters of everyone in Jabberbot's roster.  This,
and the subsequent traffic backups, crash the server at Jabber.com

I don't mean to sound snotty, but: This demonstrates a
performance/scalability issue with the server (not to mention an
outright bug if it actually crashes), not a reason not to use presence
for this purpose.


How large <italic>is</italic> that roster? If Jabber isn't scalable to
this level, it may not yet be ready for widespread use. (Consider a
mail server that crashed if you tried to send a message to more than
100 people at a time.) There is a very, very large degree of interest
in the industry right now for exactly these sorts of IM bots.
