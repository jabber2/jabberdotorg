I think this is an important point.

Many people enjoy having a status while being gone.  What is the difference 
between setting your status in Facebook to &quot;gone fishing&quot; (which persists 
even after the browser is closed) and setting your status in Jabber to &quot;gone 
fishing&quot; and wanting to close the client?  Is a status string associated with 
unavailable presence less interesting than a status string associated with XA 
presence?  Should the type of presence (unavailable vs XA) affect the 
efficiency in which it can be received?

Today I noticed a Gadu-Gadu transport that replies with presence for all of 
your GG contacts, whether offline or not.  So you get maximum efficiency in 
receiving offline presence.  I believe this feature was inspired by the fact 
that offline messages are quite popular in Poland.

Whether this feature becomes a &quot;SHOULD&quot; or stays a &quot;MAY&quot;, we still have the 
problem that a client cannot rely on the feature being present nor can a 
client even determine if the feature is supported.  When should a client 
resort to jabber:iq:last?  I think we should come up with some best practices 
here, or possibly some protocol elements.
