<PRE>Hi,

There's no problem with re-licensing it under some other opensource
license.

Any chance to make use of it while keeping compatible to other
implementations like tomcat?

&gt;<i> My other concern with scalability is the use of a DocumentBuilder that

Well, they aren't. (I guess you're talking about the payload.) 
Unfortunately there's some issue with jabber servers that aren't fully
namespace aware. As the payload within BOSH typically has to be
classified as 'jabber:client' JabberHTTPBind currently removes the xmlns
attributes when forwarding those packets as the stream they are being
inserted to is classified as 'jabber:client'. 
Problems arise if you're sending packets to jabber components expect
packets of namespace 'jabber:component:accept'. Now a jabber server that
is not namespace aware would forward packets with namespace
'jabber:client' to the component if JabberHTTPBind wouldn't remove the
xmlns attribute.

Next thing is that parsing the stuff makes sure, that no invalid xml is
being forwarded. But maybe one could just skip that too?


Cheers, Steve

PS: If you need access to JHB's SVN repo contact me offlist to get the
required credentials.
PPS: There's also a trac site for JHB but I had to take it offline
because of massive spamming (...). If you think it could be useful I
could try to reactivate it again.
