Hi all,

I've just tuned into the Jabber/XMPP/BOSH stuff.  I'm the main developer of the Jetty webserver and
a contributor to the Cometd/Bayeux project at Dojo.

I've recently been working on using the async features of Jetty to scale Cometd/Bayeux to
20,000 simultaneous users on one server: <A HREF="http://cometdaily.com/2008/01/07/20000-reasons-that-comet-scales/">http://cometdaily.com/2008/01/07/20000-reasons-that-comet-scales/</A>

I think that BOSH and XMPP over BOSH are essentially the same technique as the long polling used
by Bayeux/cometd, so it should be possible to come up with a java servlet that scales to similar levels
for BOSH/XMPP

So a couple of questions (some/most being a bit newbie in nature):

While I understand that much/most/many XMPP applications talk to dedicated servers, what is the
interest in having XMPP/BOSH terminating in a standard java web container?

What is the state of the art with regards to XMPP/BOSH servlets. Googling reveals a somewhat
confused and perhaps dated picture?

The BOSH spec looks pretty straight forward and very similar to what we have for Bayeux/cometd
I should be able to implement that in a week or so.    But will that be sufficient for XMPP
clients and servers to use it or will I need to write some XMPP adaption/integration stuff
as well?

Any interest out there for a BOSH transport for cometd/bayeux?

Is this the right forum/community to be asking these questions?


If there are any similar efforts underway, then I'm happy to collaborate with them.
But then I'm also happy to create a totally new BOSH implementation and would be keen to
meet anybody interested in Collaboration.

cheers
