Right. The core streaming stuff is in XEP-0124, which BTW we might take 
to the IETF for standardization there. A while back, Ian Paterson split 
out the XMPP-specific stuff from XEP-0124 and placed it in XEP-0206 
(&quot;XMPP Over BOSH&quot;). But implementing XEP-0124 should get you 90% of the 
way there.

Feedback is welcome on the spec and any implementation challenges you 
run into. I know there has been discussion on the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">standards at xmpp.org</A> 
list about some ambiguities in XEP-0124, and we may run through it at 
some point to clarify those issues. So let us know!

Thanks for working on this -- it seems like we're seeing more BOSH 
implementations, which will help us ensure interoperability over time.
