Hi Greg,

I am very interested in having an open BOSH implementation in Java.
Currently, I am bootstrapping a XMPP server project at Apache Labs. 
Maybe this gives you (or will give you as the lab matures) the 
infrastructure to code against on server side. On the protocol level it 
is TCP-transport-agnostic and created with other transports like BOSH in 
mind. It should be easily embeddable into Jetty as it is based on Spring 
components.

If you need any help with the XMPP side, I'd be glad to collaborate.

   Bernd
