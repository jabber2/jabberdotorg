&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> I've just tuned into the Jabber/XMPP/BOSH stuff.  I'm the main developer of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've recently been working on using the async features of Jetty to scale

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that BOSH and XMPP over BOSH are essentially the same technique as
</I>&gt;<i> the long polling used by Bayeux/cometd, so it should be possible to come up
</I>&gt;<i> with a java servlet that scales to similar levels for BOSH/XMPP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So a couple of questions (some/most being a bit newbie in nature):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I understand that much/most/many XMPP applications talk to dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> servers, what is the interest in having XMPP/BOSH terminating in a standard
</I>&gt;<i> java web container?
</I>Sorry, I can not understand that question. Not a java developer, see...

&gt;<i> What is the state of the art with regards to XMPP/BOSH servlets. Googling
</I>&gt;<i> reveals a somewhat confused and perhaps dated picture?
</I>There are severeal implementations of BOSH are available. Punjab, http-bind 
for ejabberd, something in openfire (btw - in java), may be some more. Most 
of them are [nearly ]complete. openfire and ejabberd are the jabber servers 
with http support. punjab is a dedicated software that serves http port and 
connects to jabber server. AFAIK - there are no _http_ servers that support 
bosh natively, so far I've seen only 'proxy connection' configurations that 
forward requests to nearest bosh server.

&gt;<i> The BOSH spec looks pretty straight forward and very similar to what we
</I>&gt;<i> have for Bayeux/cometd I should be able to implement that in a week or so. 
</I>&gt;<i>   But will that be sufficient for XMPP clients and servers to use it or
</I>&gt;<i> will I need to write some XMPP adaption/integration stuff as well?
</I>Well, that depends on what you are calling 'XMPP integration'.
Yes, I think you'll need somewhat light-to-medium integration. Before it was 
the single spec (http-bind), but later it was split in two to clearly divide 
transport stuff from protocol stuff. Still, as I understand - stream 
initiation/termination and may be stream errors passing also should be 
handled separately.
Though, if you just implement what is required in XEP-0124 that should be just 
enough and there wouldn't be need for questions like 'do I need to implement 
xmpp integration stuff'.


&gt;<i> Any interest out there for a BOSH transport for cometd/bayeux?
</I>Well, as there are http servers with bosh support and so far the problem is 
solved via proxying/http support in xmpp servers - yes, I think there is a 
lot of interest for such solution.

&gt;<i> Is this the right forum/community to be asking these questions?
</I>Yes, it is.

&gt;<i> If there are any similar efforts underway, then I'm happy to collaborate
</I>&gt;<i> with them. But then I'm also happy to create a totally new BOSH
</I>&gt;<i> implementation and would be keen to meet anybody interested in
</I>&gt;<i> Collaboration.
</I>Take a look at openfire. If you are both GPL and as you are both java - you 
may be able to share code.

&gt;<i> cheers
