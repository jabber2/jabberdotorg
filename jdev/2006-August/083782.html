It is not in the JEP. We needed ways to limit who talks to who. I did
not see this in the JEP. There is just voice and no voice in the JEP.
We created the role of player so observers can talk to each other but
players will not be able to see what they are saying.

The affiliation came because it was needed to have a player marked as
a player before they entered the room. We may get rid of the role.

Unfortunately, yes.
It also does not support iq translating like the other MUCs do. This
will be supported in the next version.

Thanks! I have not tested it with the t.w.p.j in subversion. I need to do this.
