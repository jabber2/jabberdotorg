<PRE>I am doing the following 

1.) Developed a java component and register it in XCP Server as follows

       a) Using the XCP Controller, edit the JSM plug-in, and click the
checkbox beside 
	     mod_external.

	 b) Scroll down, and click the checkbox beside &quot;Redirect Events
to External    
          Components&quot;. Click Go to configure a redirect instance.

       c) Configure the redirect instance as shown in the following
figure:

	 d) In the Event list, select es_out.

       e) In the Type list, select message.

       f) In the JID(s) text box, enter ECR.jabber

2.) Add an Open Port component as described in &quot;Text Conferencing
Configuration&quot;.
	In the Open Port configuration screen:

	- Enter 0.0.0.0 for the Component IP.

	- Enter 9000 for the Port.

	- Enter test for the Password. 

	- Clear the checkbox beside &quot;Service Component&quot;

	-Click the checkbox beside &quot;XDB&quot;.
		-Enter jsm:es_OUT in the Namespace Filters text field.
		-Enter * in the Host Filters text field.

After this I restart the sever and start my component on 9000 XCP
identified it and 
I am able to sending messages from one to other client but the problem
is when any reply
from other side comes packet redirected to my component are losing
message body and &lt;thread&gt;
Tag in that case I am not able to perform any logical cheq. On the
message packet.

Is any thing in the server configuration need to be change or some
mistake from my side?

Thanks
Alok

Are you passing both the incoming and outgoing message events to the
EventBroker? It sounds like you have an asymetrical configuration, which
is only getting you half of what you want.

Hi

I am developing an Customized Authorization component which will plugged
at XCP server

So please I gone through the documentation of &quot;XCP4.2_DeveloperGuide.&quot;
and write the Sample Component program
ECR.java given in that I am able to replace the messages but not able to
chat in two way manner For example if <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user1 at jabber.com</A> sending a text
message to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user2 at jabber.com</A> my sample component

ECR.java is getting perfect XDB message packages and replace a
particular phrase if it in the message and edited message Is delivered
to the destination but if from the other side if any thing type and send
as reply then my custom component 

Is not able to receive the exact message body ..

Please suggest
Alok
