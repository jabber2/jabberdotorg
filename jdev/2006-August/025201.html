Totally agree, but I always had my doubts of how well this would work  
in reality.

For ex:
  - I use my JID to log-on with Psi for IM;
  - two or more scripts I wrote are already logged on with my own  
account doing some automated actions over XMPP. They use negative  
priority;

If I log-of, the other resources will still make me &quot;online&quot;. Also,  
there is no capability I can advertise that would mean &quot;Not For Chat&quot;- 
session.

This bots want to be online, because the services they are  
interacting with want to react to their presence, but they shouldn't  
be representations of my personal IM status.

What I do now is use a different account for them, but it seems wrong.


&gt;<i> XMPP would serve very well as a messaging backbone for all of Nagios
</I>&gt;<i> for that matter.
</I>
eheh :)

That was a project at a place I used to work.

I always add the dream of seeing a MUC chatroom with all the  
mailservers of a SMTP-cluster chatting and exchanging IP's of known  
spam sources that would get blocked with IP tables. Image entering  
such a room and saying: &quot;all, block x.y.z.w&quot;

Best regards,
