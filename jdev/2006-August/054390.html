Hi Carlo and Michael,

well, you brought up good reason, I follow!
Michael you replied only to me, but here the same.

Ok, then jabber servers do a job, which is complicated to lay all in the client for jabber. In CSpace it is done and it is not necessary to have jabber protocol and CSpace under one hood, if a python client like GAJIm is interested, maybe.. why not. Thanks for the discussion, good knowledge here. In the follopup i copy a discussion of a blog discussion Cspace and Jabber, so a small jabber conference outside jabber. Maybe you are interested to read. Carlo, if you then coded a client in three evenings,
then maybe you are interest to look into the code of cspace? As you write: not all of a DHT is uninteresting...

Kind regards!

World's Most Secure Instant Messenger is here !!

 submitted by putz 30 days ago (via <A HREF="http://cspace.in/">http://cspace.in/</A>)

CSpace is a Open Source Instant Messenger which Works on Peer - Peer Technology. CSpace Supports Text Chat, File Transfer and Remote Desktop. All users create 2048-bit RSA keys for themselves, A user is uniquely identified by his RSA public key. Believe me, its the best IM i have ever seen

The last time I looked at the OpenSSL license, it was GPL-incompatible. This means that nobody can make a GPL-covered program that incorporates OpenSSL code. See <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#OpenSSL">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#OpenSSL</A> for more on this.

One would have to either pick different encryption software which is compatibly licensed (like GNUTLS), do without encryption (not advisable), write one's own encryption software (not advised without much practice), or make the encryption happen through the exec mechanism where the GPL-licensed program runs the OpenSSL-licensed program like a shell script runs the programs it uses to work.

Also, for users of the program, it's worth keeping in mind that unless you control the machine on which the software is installed, it's not safe to trust it. It's great that CSpace is free software; we all ought to be able to run, inspect, share, and modify our software. But keylogging is not something CSpace's developers can protect against. If someone installs a keylogger on the system you run CSpace on, all of CSpace's software freedom and strong encryption won't keep your messages from being read by third parties. Suffice it to say that running CSpace on a non-free OS is not a secure CSpace installation.

Whom do I trust? I trust any distributor of free software (free as in freedom to run, inspect, share, and modify). Hushmail is &quot;currently free to download and use&quot; (as their website claims) but this language suggests that the Hushmail software won't always be &quot;free to download and use&quot; and that I'm not free to inspect the program or share it with others.

If this is so, Hushmail is non-free and thus untrustworthy by default.

Even with SSL-Jabber, you rely on two or more central servers which when they go down, people notice. This looks like it's decentralized, like an open-source version of Skype.

Also, even with SSL, the Jabber servers still have to decrypt the messages. That means they can still be read by 3rd parties. For example, Google does this with its saved chats (the server stores the messages).

There is a reason, it would take too long to unencrypt all of your data. Encrypting regular communications is fine because that's usally a lot less data than an average data file. I'm not saying data files with sensitive material shouldnt be encrypted but not all data on the internet needs to be encrypted.

&quot;If memory serves, IPv6 encrpyts every connection. The problem has been sovled, the solution simply needs to be implemented.&quot;

Yikes. Don't make comments like that unless you know what you are talking about. IPv6 has IPSec (network layer encryption) as part of the base protocol suite. It will not be used all of the time, or even most of the time. In fact, the current implementation relies on static keying, which means that it has no provisions for updating encryption keys when sequence numbers are reused, so it's not even practical for most people.

Not to mention that IPv6 isn't anywhere near widespread use. Are we just supposed to stay offline until it comes around?
 by Arevos on 7/05/06

@pingveno
Jabber still uses a client-server architecture, and SSL is used only for encrypting the message streams themselves. Thus, the server is party to all communications. You can see this happening in Google Chat, where Google's central servers can record and index your IM conversations.

This IM system appears to use a fully decentralised, P2P architecture, removing the need to rely unencrypted messages through a potentially untrusted third party.

Secure and decentralized IM is already widely available with e.g. Skype, albeit proprietary. And also some IM clients carry an encryption module for use with the centralized ICQ for example.

The Skype network is one rather large one (100 Million+ users?) so it is always nice to have an open alternative.

Personally you could be interested because it is easy enough to eavesdrop on your conventional/insecure IM conversations (as is the case with most direct POP/SMTP-e-mail traffic). That is an important point for many, not just businesses.

Well big telco's might be sharing your Internet traffic with the government, and Google might be using your instant messages for marketing data.

One argument for encrypting everything is that currently, encryption makes it look like you have something to hide. If everything is encrypted, then that will not be the case. For example, Skype encrypts voice chat (between two computers) automatically. So a Skype chat doesn't look suspicious. If you have everything encrypted, than you won't look like a criminal just because you want to send something securely.

Secure and proprietary communications are at odds with each other. Skype can't be both secure and proprietary. Skype is proprietary, hence it is not secure.

Why would you want to encrypt IM? Probably for the same reason I don't walk around screaming my private conversations in public. I value privacy. 

Maybe I'm just a tin foil hat wearing liberal but this NSA spying this is very serious to me. I would love to believe America will be free but you know what? I'm just not sure anymore. I don't want the &quot;special police&quot; showing up at my door in 10 years with some IM logs in their hands. Hitler used banking records to persecute the jews. Nixon used wire taps and FBI profiles on Democrats who opposed him. It could happen again.

&quot;Secure and decentralized IM is already widely available with e.g. Skype, albeit proprietary.&quot;

I don't think Skype is quite as decentralised as CSpace appears to be. For instance, Skype remembers my contacts across machines, so there must be at least a centralised server that contains a database of user information. So far as I can see, CSpace does not have this.

@Arevos: According to the PSI WIKI[1], and my general knowledge of public-private key encryption, using the built-in GnuPG facilities of PSI will encrypt your message using the recipient's public key, send via the central server (still encrypted) and deliver the encrypted message to the recipient, who then decrypts it with their public key. Unless PSI covertly encrypts the message with an additional public key so someone else can decrypt it, I don't see how this is any less secure than CSpace's peer-to-peer model. I may be completely wrong, it's not unknown for that to happen, and I'd be happy to be corrected...

Even though the central server has no idea what you sent, it still knows that you have sent something. Traffic analysis can sometimes reveal information that you would want to keep secret. CSpace makes traffic analysis more difficult.

Whether you need such security is, however, another matter entirely.

It insinutates itself as a proxy between Messenger and the actual web and handles the encryption and authentication of methods seamlessly. I couldn't recommend it enough, especially given it's free and the professional edition, which will secure all of your IM clients, including Yahoo, AIM, Yahoo, and Trillian is less than $30.

I've looked everywhere for similar alternatives. Does anyone else know of any other products that work like SIMP where I can use the MSN Messenger client and have encryption?

I was hoping to compared SIMP against other similar products. If there are no others, I think I'll dish out the $30 for the pro edition once WLM is fully supported and out of Beta.

The main problem is a p2p system usually has terrible latency, so for things like movies and music it works well, but for a small html file it seems slow. Also, it's hard to get going (though the example I give might have more to do with a shitty program and shitty performance): freenet. Hard because you have to have sufficient content before people bother with it. The now decentralized emule is probably the best p2p web network currently available, but everyone uses it for sharing media not small files (browser integration anyone?).

Sure people could theoritcally mess with the system - which is why such a P2P internet would have to have a layer of security. Hard to program but not impossible. Not impossible. The person which makes the web page becomes the temporary sole seeder until some of his buddies visit the web site. Possibly, there could be a hybrid model: where there's a central server that's always up which is helped by peers which visit the web site. Et cetera.

And of course there would be tons of legal issues. But we already have that with file sharing ;)

I was trying to get a few friends to install WASTE earlier, I managed alright, a friend who is a bit less computer-swavy managed, and another friend who's &quot;better at computers than me&quot; (can't think of a better way of putting it) couldn't get the thing to work.. After he finally got it running and connected, after he restarted it, it refused to take his passphrase..
Getting WASTE setup is a f'king pain, to be honest, once it's running it's fine, but getting enough people to get past that inital setup is.. difficult..

This program looks not bad.. I don't personally have a use for it (FTP/DCC/MSN File Transfer will do for now)

Why not write a jabber compatible client instead? Come on ppl, jabber won't ever be widespread if no one use it. Creating an IM client using an own protocol is like writing a chat client that doesn't use IRC protocol. (I love standards btw :) )

Jabber does rock.

I prefer Gaim over this though...

Gaim 2.0 looks awsome.

what a secret things are you talkin about using your IM to incode it with 2048bit encryption?
`best IM i have ever seen` 
is it your first IM?

You could use Silc ( <A HREF="http://silcnet.org/">http://silcnet.org/</A> ) and pipe it over Tor ( <A HREF="http://tor.eff.org">http://tor.eff.org</A> ).

Or you could reinvent the wheel.

It would be more impressive if it used AES.

AES is a symmetric key cypher. CSpace beings a connection with a Diffie Hellman key exchange and then switches to a symmetric key cypher. So, you get the best of both worlds, the security of asymmetric key cryptography and the speeds of symmetric key cryptography. Actually, this is all due to OpenSSL.

It's secure alright. If I can't get to the site to download and use it, it's 100% secure.

This seems that it would only be secure until someone or something (like malware) gets access to your private keys, than all your past conversations would be accessible if they had access to the past encrypted conversations of course. For better security which means perfect forward secrecy use Off-The-Record Messaging.

Your private key is encrypted with your password. The private key stays on your machine, encrypted. And as far as forward secracy is concerned, this is exactly the reason why we use Diffie Hellman key exchange. So you get forward secrecy too.

Wasn't there a prototype encrypted p2p chat client available and pulled off the scene by AOL because the creator of the code did it while employed by AOL? I'll have to find that reference unless someone beats me to it. It required you to move your mouse around to create a completely random [har har] crypto.

The mouse movement was used to collect entropy needed to generate a public/private keypair. Modern linux kernels will use a variety of sources to collect entropy, you can get random data by reading from /dev/random. (see <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random</A> for more information)

This is silly. OTR has forward secrecy and backwards deniability. Using just the standard asymmetric encryption will provide you with only forward secrecy. I don't want what I said held against me if my keys are compromised...

I'm glad you brought this up. I think that many people do not understand the deniability aspect of OTR. I know that I didn't. Not until I read the paper describing OTR that is. People who are interested in OTR should read this paper: <A HREF="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/otr-wpes.pdf">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/otr-wpes.pdf</A> (It's good stuff, I promise)

Well, CSpace has perfect forward secracy too :) And your private key is stored encrypted on disk. So I can't say that its absolutely fool proof, but I thinks its pretty good.

Great idea, but it will never catch on. For something like this to be practical it needs to use the AIM network. Most people will not switch to a completely new network just because it is secure. It is probably better than the AIM network in every way, but better doesn't mean anything when it comes to market share. FLAC is better than mp3, but everyone uses mp3. Beta was better than VHS, but everyone used VHS. lots of things are better than AIM, but everyone uses aim.

Gaim + Off the Record + Encryption plugin is all the security you'll ever need, plus it already works with all well-established networks. Not to mention the fact that you can always connect to an SSL proxy with it as well.

This looks to be a good tool for terrorists and people committing adultery, but how in hell will this even be noticed by the millions of people who use AIM and MSN? If it doesn't support AIM or MSN, then only people with something to hide will download it.

Who cares whether they notice it or not? If you really want to send all your messages unencrypted and in public then be my guest. But please don't complain when you find out that I (or someone else) has been reading them. The choice is yours.

I couldn't care less if you read my messages. You'd have to have one helluva dull life, so be my guest. ;)

No matter what you do, encrypt or not, there will always be a way to read electronic information.

I don't see why encryption in instant messaging is such a big deal. Imagine encryption in email. There would still be spam/phishing schemes, and people would still fall for it. IMs really aren't any different, it's just a false sense of security.

I like the idea of all my chat not going through AOL's centralized servers. Also very nice that many other applications may be built off of this. Who knows what we could do with this if more users switched. For starters, any online video game could use this for peer to peer play. Sure, hackers and cheats become a problem but there are many solutions available.

Unless you are a bit paranoid or do, in fact, share lots of private information through IM, I don't see why this is useful. I don't think this will catch on with the average user because the average internet user is just not interested in switching to a completely different network and probably does not have the motivation to educate him/herself about why such an IM client would be useful in the first place.

That being said, the technology behind it sounds very interesting. I'll definitly be reading up on it.

Did I miss out something? The cspace site doesn't seem to claim itself as an Instant Messenger but a platform, so i guess the title of this digg is slightly incorrect!
The 'platform' part seems interesting; though the site doesn't seem to have any instructions for one to make use of the platform other than to use the existing set of applications
One can always download the source and check out as to how to add their app but spoonfeeding's always good :)

Just what most ppl need... an IM they can add along with MSN, Yahoo!, Google Talk, Skype and AIM to their desktop.

I think I'd rather see companies working on compatibility (maybe Jabber) than continually inventing new protocols.

While my first thoughts were along the same line (and you left out ICQ), even good open standards like Jabber shouldn't be a cause to stop innovation.
I really like the secure architecture of the CSpace platform, let's see where it goes.
After all CSpace is also an open protocol.
