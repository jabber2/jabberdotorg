&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for the suggestions. As said, I think a gateway in <A HREF="http://Cspace.in">http://Cspace.in</A> is not necessary, as we mix up secure and insecure chats and Cspace needs other development than multiprotocol, though, other jabber clients should integrate Cspace, either as a code to get a multiclient or with a transport. The suggestions are quite fitting, but I think you did not get th earchitecture of CSpace, so test around please.
</I>
You do not seem to understand purpose of jabber. Why is cspace something
so special we should care more than with other IM networks?

Between, try meet someone ask him to dictate you his public key ;-). I
remember my JID.
&gt;<i> The messenger is a p2p decentral messenger based on a kademlia dht.
</I>&gt;<i> All is encrypted in secure channels.
</I>&gt;<i> This means creating a transport is quite impossible, we would need one transport server, forwarding the message from jabber user to the C-Space ID-User, this means e.g. several users get from the same server the RSA-Key as the sender (forwarder) of the message. This would mix up the system, so only the client can integrate CSpace as a hybrid version.
</I>
Well, is it possible to run more your clients on a same computer with
separate keys? Like on a unix system, two logged-in people, having each
his own? If no, then I think your system is broken.

If yes, why could not the transport have all the private keys of the
users (OK, it is not too much secure, I know, but no transport is, you
have to give it at last password or so..) and act as many clients on the
same machine?
&gt;<i> This is requested and recommended, and if two users could switch to cspace in Jabber to jabber client, than they should leave jabber for secure Cspace protocol... of course this is very acid to jabber as here a leave of the jabber identity is necessary...  But otherwise I see ne technical solution, if you have no idea to this problem.
</I>
I want to see all these jabber-only clients do that :D. That just makes
no sense. Being you, I would ask the multiprotocol ones.
&gt;<i> So how could a jabber transport be organized in to a p2p system ???
</I>&gt;<i> The transport server then needs to deliver all messages to a certain RSA-key, found on the kademlia dht. And this means, that eihter the server or the jabber client needs to get a RSA-Key too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But for a server this makes no sense, as then there is only one KEY for several users as said, and then we are again at the model, that every client needs a RSA-Key.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> this means only the cleints can get hybrid with Cspace.
</I>IMHO they can not get hybrid. Implementation and religious reasons.
&gt;<i> There was a long time ago the question for encrypted jabber, why we need servers, if they route white node traffic, they cannot read. So a server architecture of encrypted messages is nonsense and they could to it IP to IP. They only need a lookup service to get the IP adress or RSA-key of the client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once this understood, with the first coded p2p Messenger, which is now out with CSpace, we can get rid of the jabber servers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This lead to a total re-definition of jabber, and we do not need jabberservers anymore. As this is as well the jabber developer list, I want to make the discussion more wider to change the Jabber brand to Cspace protocol and clients.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *THIS* must be jabber. Jabber needs to get rid of the servers, as emule with kademlia has as well the option to work without servers.
</I>Um, and where would all the transports, all the services, dictionaries,
offline storages go? No, you made entirely _new_ protocol, that does not
have much to do with jabber. Jabber is server-oriented. You can hardly
turn it inside out. You can get inspired and define a new protocol.

Between, speaking about redefining protocols, you should go to JIG, not
JDev.
&gt;<i> And for this purpose each client needs to implement CSpace, or lets say more freindly kademlia (but kompatible with Cspace)... Like Emule implemented Kademlia.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> understood the revolution/turnaround?
</I>If you asked me, this will not fly. You need to persuade all jabber-only
clients to include cspace. They will say &quot;Um, why? Another foreign
network, we do not care.&quot; And you need to define some binding between
jabber and cspace. 

Between, even this approach has some disadvantages by itself. You can
not just go to friends computer and log on by name and password you 
remember. Do you have contactlist that you would download each time you
log in? Do you support offline messages? Normal users just do not care
about security. That is why they still use networks like MSN or ICQ,
they are totally unencrypted.
&gt;<i> We need RSA-Key&#180;s not jabberservers in the announcement of Messenger profiles. So this needs to be discussed in the next jabber conference and we need the first python clients getting hybrid with Cspace as this is the most easiest to start with python written jabber clients.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Betreff: Re: [Gajim-devel] p2p python instant messenger integrated in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GAJIM     (pyhton)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I can't speak for the developers, but from what I know of Gajim it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; aspiring to be a multiprotocol instant messaging client.  Gajim gets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it's ability to talk to users on other instant messaging networks by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; using the Jabber/XMPP protocol to talk to special gateways (known as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; transports).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; CSpace users could use a similar method to connect to other instant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; messaging services from the native CSpace client.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd also suggest creating a CSpace plug-in for Gaim.  Gaim is designed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to support many different instant messaging protocols through the use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; plugins.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
