<PRE>Adrian, this is really a question of implementation, and ultimately only the
architects and developers of the servers you are investigating will be able
to provide an explanation, and only test figures will give you an answer...

Beyond this generic statement, in a properly architected server, applying a
blocking policy as defined by XMPP can be considered in most cases as an
enhanced routing rule. I mean in more that 80% of the case the policy rule
is based on the JIDs in the stanza. As the server is already examining these
JIDs for its own routing decisions, the blocking rule will not add by itself
a significant performance hit if the rules are already in memory. 
But obviously, if the server does not provide a good caching mechanism to
keep the most recently used rules in memory, fetching the rules from a disc
backend store will take a toll....

As I said earlier, this is a matter of implementation, and you could ask the
servers development teams to describe the way they cache the blocking rules.

Hi,
   
  We have just made available our latest free web service to use XMPP for
backend message routing.  If you are interested, feel free to visit
<A HREF="http://www.apowertouch.com">http://www.apowertouch.com</A> and give us feedback.
   
  Per my understanding of XMPP spec, user (or server ??) can select privacy
policy such that only the designated sender(s) can send messages to the
user.  All others will be blocked (or messages dropped) by the server.  My
questions are:
   
  (1) has anyone had experience implementing this policy?
   
  (2) if so, how does the server performance got impacted as it needs to
inspect the blocking list per sent message)?  Does anyone has any experience
on the performance hit as related to number of users (or messages) using
this service increases?
   
  (3) has anyone had experience in setting the block policy by default and
incrementally opened by users as they choose to?
   
  I would like to hear from both developer and administrator's perspective.
I am 
  experimenting with jabberd and wildfire and thought to ask if anyone has
tried this before.
   
  Thanks
Adrian
