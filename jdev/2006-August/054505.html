Um, that won't go trough NATs, if both sides are NATed.. (if you do not
have NATs, you are lucky and I envy you a lot. That wile creatures are
destroying the Internet).

And, by the way, I would discourage you from using port 80, unless you
intend to use http on that. 80 belongs to http and people expect web
pages to be there, besides, you need (under some systems) administration
rights to bind low ports. If you to that over TCP, choose either some
random (or let the OS give you one) and negotiate it over XMPP, or
choose something that is not used by something such widely used as http.
