<PRE>Are you passing both the incoming and outgoing message events to the
EventBroker? It sounds like you have an asymetrical configuration, which is
only getting you half of what you want.

Subject: [jdev] About XCP Program


Hi

I am developing an Customized Authorization component which will plugged
at XCP server

So please I gone through the documentation of &quot;XCP4.2_DeveloperGuide.&quot;
and write the Sample Component program
ECR.java given in that I am able to replace the messages but not able to
chat in two way manner
For example if <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user1 at jabber.com</A> sending a text message to
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user2 at jabber.com</A> my sample component

ECR.java is getting perfect XDB message packages and replace a
particular phrase if it in the message and edited message
Is delivered to the destination but if from the other side if any thing
type and send as reply then my custom component 

Is not able to receive the exact message body ..

Please suggest
Alok
