<PRE>I'm not sure exactly what you mean by performance, it really depends on what--
hopefully you HAVEN'T been reading about the nasty Microsoft-requested
Mindcraft NT vs. Linux benchmarks-- but my responses are below.

</I>
With this, it really depends on software, but in most areas, it's not
dramatically better but there is a notable difference on older hardware. NT4,
for example, as I recall, requires a good 64MB of RAM, whereas a decent Linux
installation without Xwindows will require only 16-32MB for excellent
performance except in the most demanding applications. [Disclaimer: This is in
my personal experience as a sysadmin...]

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If so, which Red Hat Linux do I need - standard, deluxe or pro?
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://www.redhat.com/commerce/redhatlinux.html">https://www.redhat.com/commerce/redhatlinux.html</A>)
</I>
Actually, the difference is in the support, as I recall, with Red Hat.
If you have the bandwidth, you can even DOWNLOAD it, but then you don't get
tech support for installation. My personal advice would be to probably save
yourself money and buy SuSE or something similar; Red Hat is, $50-$80 or so, at
last I checked. Most others are significantly better priced... but the
advantage to Red Hat is binary support. It depends on what you're doing. My
experience suggests that unless you have strange, outdated or fairly uncommon
hardware, you shouldn't need the technical support (installation and simple
configuration only, I believe) anyway.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. If not, is it ok to run my Jabber Server on a server that's already
</I>&gt;<i> getting a lot of traffic in general (i.e. this is a Pentium III Xeon 550Mhz
</I>&gt;<i> with 256Meg of RAM)....would it be better for me to just install Jabber on a
</I>&gt;<i> seperate 2nd server I have (Pentium III 233Mhz with 128Meg of RAM)...I was
</I>&gt;<i> going to use this one for a Linux server running Jabber....but with the
</I>&gt;<i> Win32 version coming out I was wondering if I should just put it on my
</I>&gt;<i> bigger NT server or maybe just make the 2nd server an NT server and use it.
</I>
Generally, the downside to running programs in NT, regardless, is that the
actual existence of the GUI in any version of Windows hampers the memory
consumption. Therefore, significant load may make you distinctly unhappy
running it as an NT service, based on the fact that unless you want a graphical
interface, Linux is console-only. No one, besides Microsoft I would imagine,
will dispute that, unless you're doing something really bizarre, console mode
has much better resource usage. [Again, this is my personal experience talking]
