<PRE>Robert,

I would feel remiss if I didn't at least try and explain my purpose in
posting my reply to your initial inquiry. If you will bear with my frankness
for a moment, I think you will better understand my position...

&gt;<i>From my viewpoint (and apparently a few other people's), the two original
</I>emails/followups which you posted sounded rather rude. It sounded rude
purely based on the fact that it was coming from someone who hadn't yet done
anything but talk loudly about wanting a jabber.dll. Understandably, Eliot's
ire was raised, as was mine. While I can understand your feelings of
frustration about the group not understanding you are a *tester*, and not a
developer, you *must*  understand that from the developer's standpoint it is
extremely frustrating to have someone posting every few days about the
status of something that is being worked on as quickly as possible.

Jabber *is* an open-source effort. Consequently, things get out of hand
every now and then. It's not unusual for flame wars (or mini-flame wars for
that matter) to happen. With so many people, cultures and ideas floating
around, someone is bound to get ticked off. I would urge you not to view
this particular war as the end of the world. As a core developer, I've had
my share of wars too. If you plan on working on any other open-source
efforts, I would suggest that you get used to the fact that people are going
to get mad at you every now and then. :)

Respectfully,

D.
