<PRE>You may have noticed that jabber.org has been getting stale, well it's
because we've all been toiling away on a new version!

0.8 is now available at <A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/dists/0.8/">http://download.jabber.org/dists/0.8/</A>

The distribution and installation are nearly identical to 0.7, and if
you're installing over 0.7 make sure you update the config files with the
new ones.

What's new?  Glad you asked... 

Etherx has been rewritten and streamlined. This gains us server-&gt;server
communications that are significantly more reliable, a new API for
transports which is more flexible and easier to write transports with, and
better cross-platform compatibility.  Etherx is a completely separate
component, and can be used for routing XML Streams outside of Jabber.

The other major focus for 0.8 has been the presence system.  A significant
portion of jserver has been re-engineered to handle the presence
architecture and allow full control and flexibility from the client.  A
sample doc explaining some of it is included in jabber-transport/docs/*
and I'll be updating protocol.jabber.org today with the new docs.

The last piece that changed was a common error response for messages and
IQ, where type='error' is set and an &lt;error&gt;Error Message&lt;/error&gt; is
included within the response.  (Client Authors: note, this changes the
response to failed auth and may break a 0.7 client logins)

Now, yes, 0.8 was very fast and we're looking to do a 0.9 in a few weeks
and 1.0 shortly after that.  The core code for the server side is very
stable and functional, and the focus of the project is starting to shift
to the clients, transports, and other add-ons.

The main protocol is basically froze in 0.8.  Only additions will be made
(that don't break existing things) so if you want to get a jump on things
that will work with 1.0, you can start now and not fear it being broken by
any more changes.
