<PRE>Evan -

Thanks for reviewing my proposal. Your comments are most welcome.

On Mon, 6 Dec 1999, &quot;Evan Martin&quot; wrote:

&gt;<i> - Napster Server:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;drscholl&quot; (<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">drscholl at hotmail.com</A>) is currently developing a open source
</I>&gt;<i> Napster server, and documenting the protocol as he does it.
</I>
Ah, that is interesting! Does drscholl's implementation provide backwards
compatibility or any special features?

&gt;<i> I try to keep the latest version of his protocol specification on my home
</I>page
&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://students.washington.edu/eeyem/">http://students.washington.edu/eeyem/</A>), which is also where anybody
</I>&gt;<i> interested can download my Napster client.  To just look at the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> spec, visit <A HREF="http://students.washington.edu/eeyem/gn/napster.txt">http://students.washington.edu/eeyem/gn/napster.txt</A> .
</I>
Yes, I browsed over it after <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jon at starbits.net</A> mentioned it to me. From a
non-coder's perspective the only comment I can provide is that it still
wouldn't provide the flexibility that an XML based system might. Does anyone
else have comments as to why a Jabber implementation of this type of system
might be different?

&gt;<i> Napster uses multiple unlinked servers.  This means that the content on each
</I>&gt;<i> server is independent of the others.  Napster servers are probably under
</I>&gt;<i> incredible loads, because searching is expensive.
</I>
Ah! I wasn't sure if they were using one server or a distributed system. Do you
know if they use some type of standard SQL database? Are there plans to make a
distributed system that you know (at least in the open source implementation)?
I would like to figure out a way for Jabster to be distributed to decrease
server load. Suggestions welcome... ;)

&gt;<i> The Napster protocol currently has a few design flaws that prevent linking
</I>&gt;<i> the servers.  This could be worked around, but it would break compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> with the existing protocol.  The Windows client doesn't let you specify a
</I>&gt;<i> server anyway, so that may be a nonissue.
</I>
Ok. One thing that I think a few people (I am not inferring that you have this
idea) that I have talked with about this have a misconception of is that
Jabster is not aiming to be a Napster-compatible solution. While we *COULD*
provide a Napster transport to translate between the systems, I was looking at
creating a completely new system that is, hopefully, superior.

&gt;<i> - Server Design:
</I>&gt;<i> Eliot wrote, &quot;- Server gathers list of results, checks to see which of the
</I>&gt;<i> hosts that have
</I>&gt;<i> the requested songs are online, pings them and sends list back to client.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> This would add the additional load of pinging to the server, which isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea and doesn't accurately represent the client-client ping anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate that the idea is new, I just thought I should add that you
</I>&gt;<i> should offload as much processing as possible to the client.
</I>
Very true. It looked like this feature was in the Windows client and I thought
it would be good.. but after further discussion the Jabber system takes care of
that problem anyway with much less overhead.

&gt;<i> Finally, is there a mailing list archive where I could read the responses to
</I>&gt;<i> his post?
</I>
Not many people have posted responses yet, but you can read the archive at:

<A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/1999-December/date.html">http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/1999-December/date.html</A> 

&gt;<i> (To the napdev list members: jabber is a messaging client, visit
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org">http://www.jabber.org</A> for more information.)
</I>
It is a quite a bit more than a simple client, otherwise I wouldn't be
suggesting this idea. 

Thanks for the input! I'd love to hear more from you!
