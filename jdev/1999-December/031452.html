&gt;<i> More concrete than future dreams, here my questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Which arefunctionally working clients I could use on my Gnome
</I>&gt;<i> XWindows. As I understand is TCL already working, when are others to be
</I>&gt;<i> released? Status is often not displayed on the jabber.org web pages.
</I>
 Cabbar, the GNOME one is fine. I'm using it no problems, bar it has a
&quot;Resource&quot; field you have to fill in when you log in, which I don't know
what's supposed to be there, but it fails to work if the field is blank.

&gt;<i> 2) To support chats, would that be task of the server to support these
</I>&gt;<i> protocols or task of a client?
</I>
 Cabbar supports &quot;Chat to user&quot; type of stuff. I assume it's just something
you have to add to each client in turn.

&gt;<i> 3) Offtopic request: Please assure that some kind of security features
</I>&gt;<i> are implemented. It could be PGP integration or whatever system you
</I>&gt;<i> like. You would win a lot of hearts of people that hate ICQ because of
</I>&gt;<i> its (missing) security.
</I>
 I was told that some sort of pluggable authentication would be
forthcoming. It's just XML based at the moment though :(
