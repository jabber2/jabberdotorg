That depends. I have started development which will ultimately result in a
set of command line tools which can easily be used to create shell scripts
and other scripting language interfaces to Jabber. However, development
has just started, so they are not available anytime soon (sometime after
christmas if I'm lucky).

And we who listen to the sky, or walk the dusty grade,
Or break the very atoms down, to see how they are made,
Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand;
The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand.
