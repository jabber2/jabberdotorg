<PRE>Quoting <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">Isotope2k at aol.com</A>:
&gt;<i> So, what's on the horizon in the convergence of IM and the wireless
</I>&gt;<i> web?  Will I be able to navigate to a Jabber-enabled WML-enabled
</I>&gt;<i> website via my web-enabled wireless phone where I can send
</I>&gt;<i> and recieve instant messages?  Is this a desirable technology?
</I>&gt;<i> Another wireless &quot;killer app&quot;?
</I>
  Without a question.  I can't speak for anyone else on the matter, but I was 
looking at the www.openwap.org project, but they are still VERY preliminary it 
would seem.

  I do have a transport setup that will *send* SMS messages to SMS enabled 
devices, using the smsclient open source project.

&gt;<i> Will I be able to have my Jabber messages forwarded to my
</I>&gt;<i> phone,
</I>
  To a netconnected phone, without a problem.  To a voice phone?  Well, that'd 
require some sort of commercial effort, simply to pay for the phone charges.. ;-
P  But overall, I see no reason why there couldn;t be an integration into some 
of the variouse IVR systems that have the capacity to read data.

&gt;<i> or be able to hear my messages through a text-to-speech
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter, much like I can with my email?
</I>
  Tex to Speech would be fairly simple for a client package to include, really.

&gt;<i> Is Jabber extensible enough that I can reply to those messages
</I>&gt;<i> verbally and know that they can be heard by the receiver?
</I>
  Yes.  A simple iQ request could answer there.  The problem lies in the fact 
that a given client may not support sound.

&gt;<i> Certainly these are all very intriguing opportunities... so what do
</I>&gt;<i> we need to do to make this happen?  I see this convergence as
</I>&gt;<i> the first real opportunity to realise the dream of always being 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;jacked in&quot;.
</I>
  You'd be interested in reading the article several of us authored for OS 
Opinions.  <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/documents/users/articles/newface.html">http://docs.jabber.org/documents/users/articles/newface.html</A>

&gt;<i> What are your thoughts?  Does anyone have similar projects in
</I>&gt;<i> development?  I really don't mean to slight the all-important 
</I>&gt;<i> groundwork that is being done currently, but I'd like to look to
</I>&gt;<i> the horizon and see how we can exploit this wonderful potential.
</I>
  These are the kind of things that will be springing up really fast, now that 
we pretty much have the core system down.
