<PRE>Quoting James Husum &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jhusum at biznizweb.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Greetings,
</I>&gt;<i> I've been following the Jabber project for a while now and it looks like it
</I>&gt;<i> has a lot of potential.
</I>
  We like to think so..  

&gt;<i> A manufacturer would be able to fill out an industry standard form with
</I>&gt;<i> information needed to submit a bid (parts, tolerances, shiping weight,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> The information would be sent electronically (preferably through e-mail) to
</I>&gt;<i> a website in an XML packet.
</I>
  Very plausible.  The data could actually be sent to a CGI form that uses 
libjnix to send a message packate to the transport hosting this applicaiton.

&gt;<i> The website would 'unpack' the XML packet and store the information in a
</I>&gt;<i> database. The database would produce dynamic data-driven pages on the
</I>&gt;<i> website.
</I>
  That'd be the transport, who would actually do the database inserts, etc..

&gt;<i> When the information is processed it would also be sent to subscribers of
</I>&gt;<i> the website who are looking for the specific type of product made by the
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturer. The prefered method is to have it resent by e-mail to the
</I>&gt;<i> website subscribers, but they also want options for having the information
</I>&gt;<i> faxed automatically.
</I>
  Same thing, the transport handling the data could easily send htis out to a 
list of other jabber enabled destinations.  There are many command line faxing 
applicaitons that could also serve this purpose.  Take the text generated 
regarding the bid, run it thru convert, a public domain utility part of the 
ImageMagic format, that could convert this text to a faxable image.  And fax 
away..

&gt;<i> If I understand the goals of Jabber, this information (or perhaps a
</I>&gt;<i> notification of a new available bid) could be sent to WAP devices, pagers,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. as well.
</I>
  Exactly..  Sent to anything that has a transport available, which would 
include WAP enabled phones, SMS enabled pagers, AOL accounts, ICQ accounts, 
etc..

&gt;<i> Is this a plausible scenario? Would Jabber be able to handle something 
</I>&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;<i> this now? If not, how long might it be before Jabber could handle something
</I>&gt;<i> like this?
</I>
  With some programming work to create the transport/gateway, this could be 
done.  Technically, if one wanted to shorten the release timeframe, they could 
do without the transport, and have the CGI form directory submit the form into 
the database, and use a command line jabber sending client to send the data to 
Jabber enabled addresses.

&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>
  Thanks for coming out of hiding.. ;-P
