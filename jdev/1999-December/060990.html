<PRE>Three days till all of our efforts on computers come crashing down
around our heads... and so here is an update on the Perl Team's efforts.

With the XML::Stream module that I got from Thomas and Jeremie I was
able to convert Client.pm to connect to a server using that.  I had to
tweak a couple of spots to fix bugs that I found, but all in all it was
an easy fix.

Once I was able to use XML::Stream I took the documentation and hammered
out Message.pm and Presence.pm.  Those two module are complete except
for support of the &lt;x/&gt; tag.  I still haven't figured out a good way to
handle things when there are multiple copies of the same tag in another
tag.

With that said, IQ.pm is progressing, but without a solution to the
above problem Roster.pm will be slow to develop.  One note about IQ.pm,
since the XML namespace determines what the query tag looks like IQ.pm
creates sub objects that represent the query and have their own Set/Get
functions.  With that framework it is actually fairly simple to write
IQ::xxxx modules, but Roster still has that problem.  IQ::Auth is
complete, and the others will be started once I finish Roster.pm.

Things are progressing quite nicely, and hopefully with more people out
of the office this week I won't get support questions and can finish
working on this before our world ends on Friday night 11:59pm.  ;)

For more information I will try to post a daily status report on the
Perl Team's mailing list.
