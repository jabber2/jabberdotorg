<PRE>Greetings,

I've been following the Jabber project for a while now and it looks like it
has a lot of potential.

I would like your opinion on a possible use for Jabber. We have a client
that would like a system that works something like this -

A manufacturer would be able to fill out an industry standard form with
information needed to submit a bid (parts, tolerances, shiping weight, etc.)
The information would be sent electronically (preferably through e-mail) to
a website in an XML packet.

The website would 'unpack' the XML packet and store the information in a
database. The database would produce dynamic data-driven pages on the website.

When the information is processed it would also be sent to subscribers of
the website who are looking for the specific type of product made by the
manufacturer. The prefered method is to have it resent by e-mail to the
website subscribers, but they also want options for having the information
faxed automatically.

If I understand the goals of Jabber, this information (or perhaps a
notification of a new available bid) could be sent to WAP devices, pagers,
etc. as well.

Is this a plausible scenario? Would Jabber be able to handle something  like
this now? If not, how long might it be before Jabber could handle something
like this?

Thanks.
