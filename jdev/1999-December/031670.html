<PRE>Greetings Jabber developers...
We've got a working (very beta) copy of a Win32 COM server up at the
download.jabber.org site. I've tested this current version with WinJab and it
appears to be working OK. Note that I am 100% sure that minor things may change,
but this should get people that have been waiting for something to use off the
ground. As the jabber protocol itself continues to evolve, I have no doubts that
this COM implementation will do so also. In addition, the long term goal is to
use the &quot;main&quot; jabberoo source code as base for another COM object. HOWEVER, we
are going to do our absolute best to keep the object model the same for future
COM server (this would allow seamless upgrades for client users &amp; authors)

There is a text file describing the current object model and events &amp; stuff
inside the zip file. Also I included a copy of regsrv32 and a batch file which
should register the COM server where you put it.

If you have questions/comments, please email me.
If you have bugs, please use bugs.jabber.org

FWIW, this existing COM server is written completely in Delphi. The source is in
the cvs tree under jabberoo/win32/delphi

Enjoy.
