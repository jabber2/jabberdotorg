You want mirc2, I think. Most winpeople seem to be using it. Have a look
at download.com. Then have a look at

<A HREF="http://openprojects.nu/services/irc.html">http://openprojects.nu/services/irc.html</A>

for a list of irc servers where channel jabber is located. Invent a cool
nick, and you're on.

&gt;<i> Can I test the clients only on a running Jabber server ? How to register to the
</I>&gt;<i> server?
</I>
I don't know of any public test servers at the moment, but there will soon
be at least one (the one I'll be setting up in a few days).

&gt;<i> Why aren't the Win32 client sources available?
</I>
The various clients are released under individual licenses, so they may or
may not have available source. However, the reason for WinJab and Jabba
sources not being released is that they are in rather early development.
 
&gt;<i> I think all this information is not easily accessible for someone not deeply

</I>
One reason for this is that the current web site has been neglected
because a new one is being furnished. It is in beta right now and should
be up shortly.

For some fancy Win32 clients (built yesterday), have a look at:

And we who listen to the sky, or walk the dusty grade,
Or break the very atoms down, to see how they are made,
Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand;
The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand.
