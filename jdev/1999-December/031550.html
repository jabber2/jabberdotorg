<PRE>&gt;<i> HI
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I AM GLAD TO HEAR THIS BUT WHY DON'T YOU AGREE FOR THE PROTOCOL ONCE AND
</I>&gt;<i> FOREVER AND STOP CHANGING IT WITH EVERY NEW RELEASE. THIS MAKES CLIENT
</I>&gt;<i> DEVELOPMENT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
</I>
Val, We are still in the process of ironing out the protocol in an effort to
get to the 1.0 release.  After the 0.8 release, no more major modifications
to the protocol will take place.  I have also been developing a Win32
client, and I stay in the #jabber chat room on irc.linux.com to stay atop
the changes in the server.  If you are developing a client, i recomend
joining us!  we could certantly use your input into the protocol.

&gt;<i> AND WHEN WILL WE HAVE SOME DOCUMENTATION ABOUT THE PROTOCOL, SO WE WON'T
</I>&gt;<i> HAVE TO SPY THE XML MESSAGES AND THE COMMUNICATION TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE
</I>&gt;<i> CHANGED AND HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS.
</I>
The documentation was being held off until the 0.8 release, and now is being
feverishly worked on by several people.  There is no need to &quot;Spy&quot; on our
protocol... this is an open source project, if you have any questions about
how any part of it works, just ask us!  were here to help.  Join us in
#jabber, and you to can have your own say in the protocol changes.


&gt;<i> AND WHO'S WAS THE IDEA TO REMOVE CONFIRMATION FROM THE SERVER ON
</I>SUCCESSFULL
&gt;<i> LOGON.
</I>
The Auth confirmation was not removed.  It was changed, however, as well as
error reporting, to a more logical structure.
if you need any help developing your client, please come see us, that's what
we are here for.  I am in #jabber almost all day long, as are alot of us.
We look forward to seeing your client!  we can always use some win32
developers.  :)

Regards,
    Keith Minkler
