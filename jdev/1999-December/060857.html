<PRE>What in the world is wrong here?  I'm a Visual C++ Developer -- not an
end-user.  How in the world did this go from 3 months ago having an
intelligent conversation about using the Jabber.dll to 3 people bashing me
for asking about the Jabber.dll ???

Have it your way...I'm out of here....I have 4 other projects such as this
that I'm following and evaluating for use by my company which is dealing
with many large clients.  We have had great success with Roger Wilco, Hear
Me, the Miles Kit and other efforts several of which are following IETF
spec. releases.  Our goal is to pick the best; but this little angst session
has gone far enough.

I'm unsubscribing momentarily (as soon as jabber.org is up again...a site
which clearly describes &quot;Testing&quot; by developers as a welcome affair) and
will have nothing good to say about how I was treated by members of this
group.

Hope you feel better after flaming and bashing....Good Luck!

- Robert

&gt;<i> Robert,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My participation is as a tester.  And as such I was simply asking about
</I>&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it would be available and commented that I had not received any response
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after asking about it for quite a while on the Win32 list and this list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You do realize of course that the jabber.dll by it self will do nothing,
</I>as
&gt;<i> such, it cannot be &quot;tested&quot; as a single entity... as such, it is only
</I>really
&gt;<i> usefull to developers, and cannot be tested, except by those using it to
</I>&gt;<i> develop a jabber application...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There *are* however two win32 clients available for download at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/win32">http://download.jabber.org/win32</A> that are working (depending on the server
</I>&gt;<i> version of course.. :)  and *need* testing..   bugs that you find can be
</I>&gt;<i> directed to <A HREF="http://bugs.jabber.org">http://bugs.jabber.org</A> so that they can be rectified... so
</I>far,
&gt;<i> it seems I am the only one who is putting in any bugs.. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can use help anywhere you can give it!  (that applies to all you
</I>Mailing
&gt;<i> list Lurkers out there.. ;)
