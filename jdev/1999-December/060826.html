<PRE>Hey folks!! Man! It's exciting being a part of this project! I can't think of
any project I would rather be involved in at this point!! So many cool things
are happening...

Anyway, I wanted to give everyone an update on my Jabster Proposal. In case you
missed it, check the mailing list archive accessible by the URL in the footer
of this message.

After a very successful chat on #Jabster (#jabber was getting a bit crowded
;)), temas hacked out an excellent design for Jabster to be distributed across
numerous servers. Without this, Jabster would hardly be of any interest as an
open source implementation of the Napster server is just around the corner. But
what is even cooler is that Jer and temas have already figured out how to use
the distributed server idea with a user directory for Jabber. Before this we
were pretty stumped on how to do that effectively. 

Anyway... my MAIN goal of this note was just to tell everyone that is
interested in Jabster development to join the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jabster-dev at jabber.org</A> mailing
list. After Jabber.org has been overhauled, we'll also get a web page setup and
stuff. 

Thanks! Have a good week of finals all you students out there. ;)
