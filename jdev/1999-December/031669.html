<PRE>I didn't actually think of that. I'm going to assume that they CAN, because
it's their service, and they're providing it to us free. Would it win them any
friends? Hardly... but I have the feeling that, given what they did to MSN, I'd
doubt that there's any way we could stop them. That is, short of trying to
reverse engineer the Oscar protocol, but -- well, bleaghh, TOC's totally
documented.

If AOL chooses to close its TOC server, there's absolutely nothing
we can do but wait for this new messaging standard that supposedly is being
worked towards by, among others, AOL and Microsoft. We'll just have to keep our
general attention kind of focused in that arena, since Mirabilis' protocol (and
obviously IRC, the other big transport everyone seems to want for Jabber, not
being subjected to the whims of a company per se) doesn't look to be in as much
danger...
