<PRE>2006/1/3, Emile Nijssen &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">e.nijssen at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> afaik only one other person has done before: to make an IM in
</I>&gt;<i> javascript+php.
</I>
There was WebMessenger working like this.
I still got the last OpenSource version before they went commercial.

Bur guess what.. You don't really need any server-side support ;-)
Check out <A HREF="http://jwchat.sourceforge.net/">http://jwchat.sourceforge.net/</A> - pure JavaScript full Jabber client.
And it really works. :-)


&gt;<i> The reason i'm asking this here is because I could only find either specs of
</I>&gt;<i> xmpp which were extremely technical, or specs which didn't tell me enough
</I>&gt;<i> about the underlying code needed to do whatever was stated there. Humans
</I>&gt;<i> probably will do a lot better job explaining stuff to me than websites.
</I>
True. Specs are really hard tu understand until you grasp the whole concept.
There is a way though... Read the whole. You don't really get it at
the begining, but when you reach the end you know enough to read it
once again with ful enlightenment. :-)

There was some good documents at <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/">http://docs.jabber.org/</A> explaining
basic concepts of Jabber that would help. But they were taken down. I
guess because they were really old and outdated and explained the old
Jabber protocol that is somewhat different to the new XMPP.
