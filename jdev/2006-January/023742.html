You raise a good point. We need do a better job of defining the order of 
any stream feature negotiations, and defining exactly what stream 
feature negotiation is and what it should look like (e.g., one of the 
implicit rules seems to be &quot;don't use stanzas to negotiate stream 
features&quot; since stream feature negotiation is seen as a preliminary to 
sending stanzas).

<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/registrar/stream-features.html">http://www.jabber.org/registrar/stream-features.html</A> currently lists 8 
stream features. The RFCs define an ordering for the features defined 
therein, namely:

1. TLS
2. SASL
3. Resource binding
4. IM session establishment

&gt;<i> And we also seem to have at least one stream feature that works with XML
</I>&gt;<i> Stanzas themselves, jabber:iq:auth.
</I>
Although non-SASL authentication (jabber:iq:auth) is a stream feature, 
it uses IQ stanzas for the negotiation and essentially it is an older 
way of doing what the RFCs define in SASL + bind + session. So the 
following order seems appropriate:

1. TLS
2. jabber:iq:auth

Normally, however, if channel encryption is desired then clients connect 
on an old-fashioned SSL port (normally 5223) and do jabber:iq:auth 
there, rather than doing the TLS upgrade on 5222 and then iq:auth. 
Though I suppose that nothing really forbids that (except RFC 3920 says 
to use SASL!).

Similarly, in-band registration (jabber:iq:register) uses IQ stanzas. 
When it is used to establish an account, it would definitely be 
completed before SASL because you can't auth if you don't have an 
account (leaving aside SASL ANONYMOUS for now). So the order would be:

1. TLS
2. jabber:iq:register
3. SASL etc. (or jabber:iq:auth)

Advanced message processing is advertised as a stream feature but its 
use is not negotiated and does not really need to be before sending 
stanzas (e.g., support for it could be discovered via service discovery 
and we added the stream feature to JEP-0079 mainly for purposes of 
potential efficiency). So we don't need to define an order here. (Indeed 
it could be argued that we don't need a stream feature for this.)

Stream compression is negotiated when you can't set the TLS compression 
bit for whatever reason. I'd agree with Ralph that negotiating this 
after TLS and before SASL (or jabber:iq:auth) makes the most sense. So:

1. TLS
2. Stream compression
3. SASL etc. (or jabber:iq:auth)

What if you want to do in-band registration and stream compression? I'd say:

1. TLS
2. Stream compression
3. jabber:iq:register
4. SASL etc. (or jabber:iq:auth)

The more stream features we add, the more complex this all becomes. 
That's one good reason to not define more stream features than we 
absolutely need. :-)

Perhaps we need a little JEP that specifies the recommended order of 
negotiation for the stream features in the registry, and we update that 
JEP whenever we define a new stream feature?
