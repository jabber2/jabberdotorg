<PRE>Thank you for the feedback so far. Seems the right people are here. :)

First the environment. We're a small webhosting company that is actually
managed by my dad and me only, where I do the tech stuff. I'm running
that Jabber server to the public and primarily set it up for my personal
use. I don't expect more than a handful of users to show up there in the
near future (currently there's two users). So performance/scalability
isn't an important thing to me. I could even say I don't need a data
import facility right now, but that shouldn't be too often in the
future... In any case I'm going to use an open database (MySQL would be
good). I never managed to export that Erlang database thing (forgot its
name) and I somewhat dislike closed data storage systems.

I've been looking through the Wildfire issue tracker and forums
yesterday and I've seen that Privacy Lists are planned for a soon
version, but it's also been deferred in the past. So let's see when it's
ready. I'm not sure if using Spark is an option for me. I'm so much used
to Psi already. :)

ejabberd has virtual domains support which is a thing I really could
use. Once I have setup my e-mail spam filter, I could use the same jid
as my e-mail is. Currently that's on different domain names. While the
Wildfire web interface says &quot;Domain name(s)&quot; (translated from
&quot;Domainname(n)&quot;) we haven't seen where one could manage multiple domains
per server.

I've never had much luck with that Erlang thing. I somehow did manage to
get an old version (8.x or so) compiled or found an external Debian
package but that won't do for ejabberd 1.0 so I'll need to go with the
binaries from process-one. I don't even rudimentary understand Erlang so
not having the source code is okay for me, but I don't think I can use
bleeding-edge CVS or patched versions this way. I don't know if that may
become a problem. Wildfire is a Java application, which makes it equally
portable (a friend tested it yesterday, first on Windows then on Linux,
that's where I checked out the web interface) but I assume (didn't try
it yet) that Java should be easy to install and since I do read and
write Java I'm able to build it on my own if in need or even create
plug-ins.

The time schedule for this is something around one or two months. I'm
planning to get a new server by then and I'm currently preparing the new
setup. I think I'll be able to try out both servers on my test machine
by then.
