</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT VERY WELL VERSED IN JABBER.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I work in a 700+ seat call center where I would like to use Jabber
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for real-time notifications. Essentially what I would like is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> read-only or one way client for the agents on the floor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like it so that any supervisor or operations manager can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message any individual agent, team, group of teams (e.g. all teams
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on one operations managers group of teams), all agents currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> logged in and all agents in a particular queue (some agents are in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more then one queue). To accomplish this it would seem like some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sort of class based system would be required.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also I do not need nor want the agents to be able to chat with each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other or even reply to messages sent by supervisors/managers. A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receipt conformation might be helpful so that the sender knows that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the message has been read. It would also be great if it were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible to see if an agent is currently on the computer or if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computer has been locked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like the client to automatically login to the server when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user logs into Windows without the user needing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authenticate. Ideally the Windows username would be the JID. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don?t feel there would be any need for a password.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The client should stay hidden in the system tray when no message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has been received. When the tray icon is clicked a history of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages at least covering the current login session should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> displayed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there anything out there that would fulfill my needs? How
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difficult would it be to code such a client in something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Python or Ruby (Qt would be really nice).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Open source licensed clients, libraries and other bits of code are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more then okay.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for your input.

</I>Hmmmm chances are you are going to have to HACK alot of the
functionality you want. In terms of messaging only being one way, the
only easy way I could see that is if lets say you had virtual servers.

supervisor.jabber.domain.com
and
analyst.jabber.domain.com

In theory you could put in everyones privacy list, do ignore messages
from analyst.jabber.domain.com. (They may not have to be different
servers, and the above may not work, but its just an educated guess).

In terms of windows user/pass I don't know of any clients that do that
'perse' there was a thread here recently, and I think Wildfire / Spark
do that in theory, but not to the degree you want.

The groups are all very possible, but I think your best bet would be
to dare I say is to write a VB Application, and just use an XML parser
on it, or even string searches, since you want such a limited subset
of functionality, and also want some extra functionality. I don't konw
of any non-cumbersome way to have read reciepts that wouldn't be
annoying for the people recieving them.

In terms of Locked or Online, you could have it send it as a status.

So in theory you would need to create a Winsock object that sent the
auth credentials, (simple copy and paste would work, getting the
windows username), and a standard password in the database.

Messages would come in like

&lt;message from='<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at domain.com</A>'
type='headline'&gt;&lt;subject&gt;Subject&lt;/subject&gt;&lt;body&gt;Body&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/message&gt;

Since its so simple, and wouldn't require any roster support or
anything, something like the above to make would probably only be
about 2 or 3 hours. With most F/OSS stuff you are going to have look
at disablinging an awful lot tho. The above is just some thoughts.
