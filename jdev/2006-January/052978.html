If there is a consensus on this, then it should get a specific mention
in the new RFC.  Better to remove assumptions altogether.

&gt;<i> &gt;Regarding the issue of SASL EXTERNAL and support for subjectAltNames,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I dont think it is currently possible to have a valid certificate with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;subjectAltName extensions since none of the CA's are supporting it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Right. That's why as a fallback all server implementations I know check
</I>&gt;<i> the CN if there is no subjectAltName extension.
</I>
But CN check fails when I'm running a xmpp service for a domain (eg.
example.com), but using a different dns name (eg. im.example.com),
since the cert will have the CN as im.example.com

&gt;<i> &gt;I think there should be something done for enabling federation between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;servers using DIGEST-MD5 or even PLAIN.  Otherwise, this looks like a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;no-go.  Servers will keep relying on dialback.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Using DIGEST-MD5 or PLAIN for interconnection between servers would mean
</I>&gt;<i> that EVERY PAIR of jabber servers would have to agree on a shared
</I>&gt;<i> secret. That's very much impractical.
</I>
True, thats why I believe that something should be done to facilitate
it.  Otherwise, how about having TLS+SASL ANONYMOUS for s2s then?

Regards,
Vinod.
