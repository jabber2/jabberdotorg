I would be... surprised if they're validating XMPP more thoroughly than the commercial server that I am familure with (Soapbox). 

In fact, a big problem we had with XMPP validation is that so many clients and servers are noncompliant. Upon releasing our server, we actually had to turn off most validation by default because of the huge number of non-compliant clients and servers. At one point we naively asked people to fix all the broken code, but that didn't get very far, so &quot;StrictValidation=False&quot; became the default in our configuation files... 

If only there was a way to make all these lazy open-source developers actually update and maintain their code, everything would be so much easier. heheh. :)

As an aside, this is one of the areas I really wish was better about XMPP. I understand the reasons we can't use XSD to validate our stanzas, but it always stuck me as wrong to have an XML protocol designed in such a way that the tools and languages designed specifically to enfore compliance cannot be used. This is one area where the SOAP and WS- crowd is clearly ahead.
