<PRE>Hello,

I want to run an online service that allows users to organize their 
writings in a heirarchical manner and share them online - allowing for 
commenting, etc.

The difference between this and a traditional weblog service is that in 
this case, users can organize their writings in any way they wish, be in 
by subject or chronological.

This isn't a webpage, but rather a service with a downloadable client 
and server running off somewhere which acts as the main data repository.

I've written most of the client/UI in C++/wxWidgets, and am now trying 
to figure out what kind of networking architecture I want to use.

I figured that I could write a proprietary protocol or use an existing one.

I was looking for libraries that would make it easy for me to 
communicate between client and server. I stumbled across Jabber this way.

Is Jabber extensible enough to allow this? Would I write a custom Jabber 
server or write a component to provide these services? Would I save a 
bunch of trouble just using a custom ad-hoc protocol?

Can anyone suggest a C++ library that would aid me in this? I'm not sure 
if I want to release source for this, so a BSD-type license would be 
preferable.

Tommy Li
