<PRE>about that, I just signed up for the mailing list, so i'm kinda n00b here.

I need somebody who can help me to set up a new (hehe) xmpp server as a
gateway between my own IM and everything else. It's a personal thing that
afaik only one other person has done before: to make an IM in
javascript+php. The problem here is that I *do* want full compatability with
xmpp, but I also want it to work with *just* php (serverside). I've got this
hunch that that is not going to work. So who's going to help me to make it
work anyway? By helping, I currently mean:

- explaining how xmpp works :-) I haven't got a clue how to start right now
- explaining SASL and other security features

It would really be nice if that someone would add me in MSN Messenger.
Further details will then follow. It shouldn't take a lot of time, I just
need a small head start and then i'll complete everything else myself.

The reason i'm asking this here is because I could only find either specs of
xmpp which were extremely technical, or specs which didn't tell me enough
about the underlying code needed to do whatever was stated there. Humans
probably will do a lot better job explaining stuff to me than websites.
