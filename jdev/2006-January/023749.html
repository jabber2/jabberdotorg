Yes, most clients do this wrong.

In the old days (and possibly still today), clients often bolted account 
registration onto an existing login dialog with a simple checkbox saying 
&quot;register the account&quot;.  If checked, the client would attempt to create the 
account based on the login information you provide, prior to logging in as 
normal.  Because this meant that the fields were fixed, I suspect it started 
a trend of clients not honoring the registration form.

However, I don't see the situation improving at this point.  My personal 
opinion is that account registration does not belong in the Jabber protocol, 
just as you won't find an account registration feature in other protocols 
either (FTP, SSH, etc).  I hope to someday remove account reg/unreg from Psi.

As anyone should know by now, the best way to obtain an account for anything 
is to contact the administrator of the service.  If the admin wants to 
automate the process, he uses a web-based signup page.  If he wants to 
require certain information (read: email address), then he includes the 
necessary fields as part of the web form. :)
