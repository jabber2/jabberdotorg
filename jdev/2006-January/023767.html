<PRE>I'm not what you're looking for, but I might be of interest later on

I'm a first year university student who has been into searching for fun on
the far edge of Javascript capabilities for about two years already. I'm not
of much use for this job because I'm simply not full-time available, but you
might find me resourceful in smaller projects. If you want to see some of my
work, log in to my laptop at <A HREF="http://84.104.157.139:81">http://84.104.157.139:81</A> and you'll see what
I'm all about. In short: I can make anything work in Javascript and PHP, I
do lots of computer maintanance and building in my free time, i've got some
programming experience in Java (though C++ is my big knowledge gap) and
visually I like to use programs like Macromedia Studio MX 2004 and 3ds max.

My webpage isn't necessarily an organized webpage, it is more of a sandbox
for me to play and learn.Everything that is on there is 100% mine, hand
typed hardcore javascript and PHP. My current big project is Quing/Site
Chat, a 100% PHP+JS instant messenging thingy. If I can find time i'll try
to learn the XMPP protocol and make a transport from Quing to XMPP, although
I don't want to use any compiled programs because I want my website to be
(eventually) deployable on any server running PHP+mysql. Everything I do
right now is just a hobby. I don't make money out of it. When I get internet
of my own and more free time, i'll probably start my own company or
something like that. My mother tongue is Dutch, although English is the
language I use for practically everything but getting groceries.

Keep me in mind,
