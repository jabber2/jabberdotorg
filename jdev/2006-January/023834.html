While I do find WildFire's web interface prettier, the only real  
thing about it that I really -use- that ejabberd's doesn't have is  
the ability to see a user list, maybe muck with their accounts a tad,  
and most importantly add a new user.  I know the command like tool  
can do that, but still.  That's definitely something I'd like to see  
appear in the web interface.  =)
