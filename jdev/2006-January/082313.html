I want to note here that JEP-0138, Stream Compression, should be done
after TLS negotiation. The JEP does not mention that it should also go
before SASL but that seems fairly logical.

As we may come up with more and more stream features, it might be good
to think about how to do the ordering of steps correctly, before actual
XML Stanzas can start to be communicated.

And we also seem to have at least one stream feature that works with XML
Stanzas themselves, jabber:iq:auth.
