<PRE>Hi all,
 
Glad to join this mailing list! Hopefully it will help me solve the problem that has bothered me for quite a long time. 
 
Recently I'm trying to implement a jabber im client of j2me version. I found Mobber sets a very good example. But then I discovered Mobber works well only on emulator; when transplanted it to mobile, it doesn't work at all. I mean, it stops at the login stage. 
 
The main symptom on mobile is that when getting xml feedback from the server, it can read only a portion of the xml file (approximately 200 characters or so), and then it stops at a fixed position. It seems the program is still trying to read something from the server, but it's just trying, trying, trying, has no result; until the connection time used up. 
 
At first I thought it's because of mobile's limited memory resource. But after I tested on Nokia 6630, Sony E k700i, etc, I found every time it stops in the same position, and at the same time, their memory cost is not that costive (approximately more than half memory is free) as I imagined. 
 
Have you ever met a problem like this? Or could you give me some suggestions on how to connect and communicate with jabber server when implementing j2me version? 
 
BTW, the programming language I used is java. 

Any comments or suggestions are really welcomed!!!
 
Best regards,
Can
