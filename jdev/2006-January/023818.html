<PRE>DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT VERY WELL VERSED IN JABBER.

 

I work in a 700+ seat call center where I would like to use Jabber for
real-time notifications.  Essentially what I would like is a read-only or
one way client for the agents on the floor.

 

I would like it so that any supervisor or operations manager can message any
individual agent, team, group of teams (e.g. all teams on one operations
managers group of teams), all agents currently logged in and all agents in a
particular queue (some agents are in more then one queue).  To accomplish
this it would seem like some sort of class based system would be required.

 

Also I do not need nor want the agents to be able to chat with each other or
even reply to messages sent by supervisors/managers.  A receipt conformation
might be helpful so that the sender knows that the message has been read.
It would also be great if it were possible to see if an agent is currently
on the computer or if the computer has been locked.

 

I would like the client to automatically login to the server when the user
logs into Windows without the user needing to authenticate.  Ideally the
Windows username would be the JID.  I don't feel there would be any need for
a password.

 

The client should stay hidden in the system tray when no message has been
received.  When the tray icon is clicked a history of messages at least
covering the current login session should be displayed.

 

Is there anything out there that would fulfill my needs?  How difficult
would it be to code such a client in something like Python or Ruby (Qt would
be really nice).

 

Open source licensed clients, libraries and other bits of code are more then
okay.

 

Thanks for your input.
