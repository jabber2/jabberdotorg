</I>&gt;<i> In thinking about federated social networks, I started to wonder if
</I>&gt;<i> certain features enjoyed in monolithic systems might not carry over very
</I>&gt;<i> well to our world. There are many situations where Facebook tailors your
</I>&gt;<i> view based on its all-knowing graph database, but these kinds of things may
</I>&gt;<i> be hard to pull off when there isn't any all-knowing entity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take, for example, the case of viewing a Facebook post that contains many
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;likes&quot;. If any of your friends liked the post, then their identities will
</I>&gt;<i> be placed in the data summarization of that post. This scales well, too. A
</I>&gt;<i> public post which might have 10000 likes will still manage to include your
</I>&gt;<i> 1 friend that liked the post in the summary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if it's possible for these kinds of features to exist fully
</I>&gt;<i> decentralized (or at least not without it being insanely complex), but we
</I>&gt;<i> of course we don't want a wholly centralized system either. Maybe there's a
</I>&gt;<i> middleground, whereby complex brainpower can be offloaded to special
</I>&gt;<i> services dedicated to the task, without putting everything in that basket.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking of a model like the web and search engines. The web is
</I>&gt;<i> functional without Google, but Google adds a lot of all-knowing value to
</I>&gt;<i> those who wish to use it. So, perhaps services like Buddycloud could take
</I>&gt;<i> care of all the storage, actions, federation, etc, but then separate smart
</I>&gt;<i> searchy entities could be optionally integrated to augment the experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I bring this up here is to discuss some protocol. I think all
</I>&gt;<i> that is really needed for a system like this to work is for the smart
</I>&gt;<i> entity to act as a proxy. So, when fetching a post, you'd send a request to
</I>&gt;<i> the smart entity, which then requests out to the post source. If the post
</I>&gt;<i> has 10000 likes, then the smart entity would need to download all of these
</I>&gt;<i> and create a customized summarization to be returned to the initial
</I>&gt;<i> requester. Oh, and of course we'd need a way for the post source to
</I>&gt;<i> validate that the smart entity can act on behalf of the initial requester.
</I>&gt;<i> The smart entity should not have full access to everything, but only what
</I>&gt;<i> it is able to see based its users. The end result is that there isn't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily any smart entity that knows *everything*, but perhaps several
</I>&gt;<i> that independently know enough to get the job done for their users. Like
</I>&gt;<i> search engines on the web, these smart entities of federated social
</I>&gt;<i> networks could be proactive in crawling, subscribing to, and caching data,
</I>&gt;<i> such that in many cases they will immediately have answers for their users
</I>&gt;<i> without needing to proxy out every time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps this could be accomplished with something like XEP-291 (to allow
</I>&gt;<i> your JID to vouch for a third party JID allowed to act as you), and SHIM
</I>&gt;<i> (for the proxied request to stamp who the original requester was).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that it? Can anyone think of a smart feature they've seen on Facebook
</I>&gt;<i> or Google+ that could not be accomplished with this very simple protocol?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there are some features that absolutely require a central entity?
</I>&gt;<i>
