<PRE>Hi all,

I'm experiencing weird behaviour from Facebook's XMPP service.  It
sometimes sends a bunch of roster pushes where the contact's name is
empty.  This makes my roster display next to unusable, as Facebook JIDs
are all numeric.  After a minute or so, it _sometimes_ sends a bunch of
roster pushes containing the correct name for each contact, but more
often than not my roster is in an all-numeric state.

I could of course just modify my client to ignore such roster pushes,
but for my client, the processing of these roster pushes takes a
non-negligible amount of time, during which the UI is blocked.

I first experienced this about a month ago, and soon after that other
users reported the same problem on the jabber.el mailing list.

So my questions:

1. Is this a widespread problem?  It happens to me and some other
   jabber.el users, and I was able to reproduce the problem with Psi.
   On the other hand, I searched for other reports of this problem but
   couldn't find any.

2. Is there a way to make Facebook stop doing this?  Does anyone have
   contacts at Facebook who could be persuaded to look into this
   problem?

Regards,
Magnus
</PRE>
