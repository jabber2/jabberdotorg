<PRE>If I go and open 10,000 http requests to your machine is that ok?  What
if I send about 100+msgs/second through your mail server?  What if I
browse your web site and use your resources, but totally ignore the
terms of service that you have posted?  (Did you notice the terms of
service link on the bottom of all aol pages?)  And technically they do
feel the use of unauthorized software is a problem, because they feel
they own your username and screenname, and we're making unauthorized or
licensed use of that information.  Plus we're allowing for it's use in
an uncontrolled and unrestricted manner, which could lead to an increase
in password theft.  All of which they have large problems with.
Personally, I'm not seeing the double standard you are suggesting.
