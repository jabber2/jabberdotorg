completely untrue ? hmmmm just look at the
whitepaper on jabber.com site 'Comparaison between JCP and JOSS'.
Strange thing for me is that JOSS is shown there as something
completely immature - a toy that can be used only by few enthusiasts.
I understand that this is the way all the commercial companies should
go as they want to sell their products and it's not enough that their
products are good but because they are better then the others.

may you give me few hints about what protocol changes that
JCP doesn't have and JOSS has ? The strong points of
JOSS that you wrote above are the strong points of all
Open Source projects in general.

I don't want to fight with jabber.com :&gt; but i think
we should decide what is important for making our ( JOSS )
server better and to better respond to the market needs.
Why IRC is so popular ? Because irc was the first chat
but also because it offers reliable and free software
that you don't have to restart every few hours/days loosing all
your online users.

One of the things was scalability - ok - now we have
some people interested in doing this, i will also try
to help. We will see what happens next.


&gt;&gt;<i>yes, and i was thinking about this already. But the problem is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>people want's to have addresses like <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">pippo at hotmail.com</A> not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">pippo at s1.p2.rn45.hotmail.com</A> . Because this will be needed in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>future if your system will grow.
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, I think your confused, Jabber works very much like email and your
</I>&gt;<i> address is <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at domain</A>, not <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at localmachiene.</A>
</I>
So please can you explain me what i have to do to
make installation of the jabber server on 3 physical machines named
first.domain.com, second.domain.com, third.domain.com, and
to let all the users have the JIDs like <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">login at domain.com</A> ?
And to make it possible that when the average number of users
on each machine will be higher than given number i only add another
one called fourth.domain.com to lower the load ?
In my opionion this is impossible.
