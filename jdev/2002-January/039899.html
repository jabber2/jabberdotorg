<PRE>Mike-

It is my understanding that DotGNU working group wanted to use this for
their project. In that case, it is entirely possible that they are sending
messages much larger than the size a &quot;normal&quot; (user-to-user) message would
be... however, I'm still with you. I'm not convinced that much would be
gained by gzipping a 5K SOAP packet, especially when you consider the
overhead caused on CPU/memory usage. I think it would definitely need some
sort of hash to verify data integrity. Hmm... still seems like it'd be an
interesting idea to toy with.

Which I guess isn't outside the range of what everybody else has already
been saying.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hypothesize that the answer to question (1) will imply that the data

</I>&gt;<i> non-compressible compared to the 200kb that crossed in 24 hours, and so 
</I>&gt;<i> the answer to (2) will be no. But I will have to look into it further.
