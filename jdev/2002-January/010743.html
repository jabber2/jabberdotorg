<PRE>I totaly agree with Ashvil.
It's the same kind of discussion I was trying discuss in the jadmin list.
You can follow the the below discussion in the jadmin list.

Subject: Re: [jadmin] When may the scalability issues solved??


&gt;<i> Do you think these performance parameters are really necessary for the
</I>&gt;<i> design?
</I>&gt;<i> I mean in my opinion, anyone suffering from scalability and performance
</I>&gt;<i> should easily be able to overcome this problem by adding a new hardware
</I>box
&gt;<i> to the farm.
</I>&gt;<i> I know it is easy to talk about it :) and it may require radical changes
</I>in
&gt;<i> the design but it doesnt seem impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This issue is the most important advantage of  the commercial server over
</I>&gt;<i> the open-source one.
</I>&gt;<i> It's for sure Jabber.com has to earn some money to stay alive and continue
</I>&gt;<i> support for Jabber technology.
</I>&gt;<i> But in my opinion without solving the scalability issues, the open-source
</I>&gt;<i> server will go no furher than serving
</I>&gt;<i> limited community of users and never being considered as a mass IM
</I>&gt;<i> technology or an alternative to the commercial one.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well I think we'd need to set some parameters. It's easy to talk about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scalability but how high do people (e.g., you) really need to scale in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; terms of registered users, concurrent users, messages per second, and so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on? Hard numbers will give developers some design goals.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have been following the Jabber technologies through this list for
</I>&gt;<i> about a year.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And I have also setup a server myself and wrote a simple client for
</I>&gt;<i> test.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; At that time, I was searching for messaging technologies and heard
</I>about
&gt;<i> Jabber.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; After some research, my first question was the &quot;Scalability Issues&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which seemed a major problem to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I wrote it to the list and I asked what to do or any plans for solving
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I was told that by the time I was able to collect that many users, the
</I>&gt;<i> problem would be already solved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I havent of course that many users but without the techn.
</I>availability,
&gt;<i> you cannot promote your service with confidence.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As you can see the frequent posts on this list, &quot;Scalability Issues&quot;
</I>are
&gt;<i> still the major concern for many of us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I appreciate and congratulate all the designers, developers and
</I>&gt;<i> contributers to this technology.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But in order to boost it, in my opinion, it is a Priority #1 issue to
</I>be
&gt;<i> solved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I know there are methods to increase the # concurrent users on a
</I>single
&gt;<i> machine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There are also contributions to allow for farming and multiplexing
</I>&gt;<i> socket connections.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Do it yourself may be a method, but I think this issue must be solved
</I>in
&gt;<i> design and standardly integrated in the main architecture .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Again in my opinion, the best way would be the farming with support
</I>for
&gt;<i> a central xdb, which would give the most flexible architecture in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> scalability and high-availability.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You can offer the &quot;Jabber.com&quot; commercial product for those big
</I>players,
&gt;<i> but  you know it wouldnt be the best solution for many of us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I would be pleased to know what you think about this issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What priority should it be for future releases?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
