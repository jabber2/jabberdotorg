<PRE>This idea would also fit into the corporate way of thinking. 

If enterprises could have a single point of relay between their intranet
and the internet they would only have to worry about controlling one
place to handle access control, virus scanning, etc., etc., etc.

I like this idea a lot.

</I>&gt;<i> There is a very simple reason why any approach like this is doomed to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, the technique AOL is/was using to track the IPs
</I>&gt;<i> being used by aim.jabber.org was that they had a dummy AIM account and
</I>&gt;<i> registered the transport to use it via jabber like any normal user does.
</I>&gt;<i> Either they just used a normal client to do this or script with a jabber
</I>&gt;<i> module. Once aim.jabber.org logged into AOL w/ that dummy account, they
</I>&gt;<i> would examine the source IP for that client connection (I'm sure they
</I>&gt;<i> regularly block abusive users/IPs and this action is quite easy with their
</I>&gt;<i> administrative tools).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The entire thing could be automated on their side, and it would only take
</I>&gt;<i> a very short amount of time to obliterate any network of aim transports or
</I>&gt;<i> socket redirectors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fully agree, this battle isn't one for the technology, our technical
</I>&gt;<i> resources are better spent improving Jabber, and if anyone has political
</I>&gt;<i> resources those are probably best spent showing the world why a commons

</I>&gt;<i> commercial/corporate networks.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The key would for any &quot;permanent solution&quot; to be completely transport

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; install new software (won't happen), or even server-side which would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require server admins to re-do their entire server installation. Here's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a solution:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Modify Temas's AIM-T to find other AIM-T's on the Jabber network in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DNS-like propogation system (how DNS entries spread accross the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internet). When someone connects to an AIM-T, any AIM-T, the collective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AIM-T's &quot;shuffle&quot; the users connections around, randomizing IPs and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributing load. Once a hundred or so IPs are on this &quot;OpenAIM&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; network, it would be near impossible for AOL to track down even a small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; percentage of the IPs... especially if the IPs are somehow transparent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the client (to stop an AOL employee downloading and tracking AIM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connections through Jabber). The only IP the client would see is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AIM-T at their home server, but the IP that actually is making the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection could be any one of dozens if not hundreds. Alot of potential
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here, folks... And this OpenAIM network would bring on alot of those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;multi-protocol&quot; clients that are not yet 100% Jabber... I would see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Everybuddy and GAIM becoming full Jabber clients if we could pull this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; off...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And in actuality, I think alot of the technology to do this is already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out there, it just needs to be pulled together.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I'm 100% behind this idea. I am a crappy programmer, but I would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; willing to dedicate some pocket money to help a programmer or two get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this up.... Whadda say? I know there are some problems, but instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shooting this idea down, how about we put our thinking caps on and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; figure out viable solutions? Wow, I think this could work...
