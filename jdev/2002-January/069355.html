The truncated welcome message might have happened because of editing the
file. Do you by chance use pico or something similar when editing the
jabber.xml file? pico truncates long lines sometimes, which used to
cause problems with me until I realized it and just started making sure
of what I was doing.

The truncated conference messages are a bug that is fixed in the CVS of
&quot;conference&quot; I installed it and it's been working fine ever since.
Someone really does need to make a new conference package using the CVS.
It's stable.
