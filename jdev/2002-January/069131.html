<PRE>Jean-Louis,

Four points;

1) Antepos' website states it distributes Uppli's Messanger as a J2ME client, which is based on my library, as the Email from Uppli shown at <A HREF="http://www.alsutton.com/software/antepo-uppli.html">http://www.alsutton.com/software/antepo-uppli.html</A> prooves.

2) The fee-based licence agreement came into force because of companies distributing products based on my code under a commercial licence without donating to it's development, which I beleive is wrong and wanted to protect against.

3) The timing of the licence change had nothing to do with Antepo. I am sure you keep your partnering agreements under tight enough security to ensure non related third parties are not aware of them.

4) I'm not prepared to allow you to attempt to strong arm any developer using my library, and as this is the list on which the libraries availability was announced I felt it would be the best place to ask if anyone else has received legal threats from your company.

If you wish to continue this conversion please do so off this list, as I feel further disussions of this nature are not of interest to the general community, and please remember that your company's right to distribute or reproduce any system containing my code has been revoked.

Regards,

Al.

Dear Al,

Your recent whining has been brought to my attention. Before this thread
snowballs, I want to bring truth to what you are heralding in this forum. I
also would like to point out that the JDEV development list is probably not
the most appropriate forum for such discussions. IMHO your attitude is
disrespectful towards a community you are hijacking as a forced witness. I
am sure you will appreciate that we developers have better fish to fry than
read wrongful accusations against well-established companies such as ours.

Before you make any claims that &quot;Antepo distribute a J2ME client based on my
library&quot;, I thought you'd like to know that the current Antepo commercial
J2ME solution (I'm obviously not talking about Uppli's uMessenger freely
available for download) does NOT include any bit of your software and can
therefore be distributed as freely as we desire. Not to bring down your
efforts or skills, but KvmJab is a fly-by-night, crappy, buggy, non-secure,
non-scalable, non-device-optimized piece of software that our company was
reluctant to use from the very beginning given our customers' requirements
for real-life implementations. Feel free to revoke any right you want...

Second, I think you have no lessons to give regarding strong-arm practices.
I thought the community would be happy to know how you allegedly used such
tactics to obtain fees from Uppli following our company's public
announcement of a partnership with a major corporation involving software
derived from Uppli's.  Is it a coincidence that your KvmJab license
retroactively becomes fee-based on November 20th 2001 when Antepo announced
this major partnership on November 21st?  Where you hoping to make an extra
dime on second thoughts? A little too Microsoft-like for an open source
Robin Hood, isn't it?

As for copyright infringement issues and litigation we may have with other
companies, I suggest you stick to development like I do and let the lawyers
do their jobs. This is certainly something you and I have no control over,
nor expertise in dealing with. Convinced? If not, email me and we'll
talk...privately this time, in respect for the community.
