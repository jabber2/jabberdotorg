Excellent.  I've been harping on this for a while.

&gt;<i> I would like to see a freeze in features allowing to write those down
</I>&gt;<i> as much as possible, and move the parts which are actaully implemented
</I>&gt;<i> and in use from the draft section move into the &quot;standard&quot; section.
</I>
This is part of the standards process in the foundation however I agree that
its being given short shrift.  I was arguing for rigorous standardization of
the existing Jabber protocols before doing anything else but was convinced
that things need changing (jabber next generation).  So from what I
understand, we're going to be creating the next generation protocols then
documenting...  I'd be interested in discussing it further though.

&gt;<i> If you are really in dire need of ideas to code, I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> see how server SSL certificate checking like in https could be done from
</I>&gt;<i> the client. It would be great too if the SSL server would react better if
</I>&gt;<i> the SSL certificate is not present or readable (it simply don't answer
</I>&gt;<i> the client requests without dropping the connexion), and if there was
</I>&gt;<i> an official way to bin all interfaces (ACCEPT *) to the SSL port with a single
</I>&gt;<i> certificate (something like &lt;ssl port='5223'/&gt; in pthcsock and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;ssl&gt; &lt;key ip='*'&gt;/etc/sysconfig/jabber/jabberkey.pem&lt;/key&gt; &lt;/ssl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> in the io section). It's just a few things I had to fight with in the
</I>&gt;<i> last days. 
</I>
You should jump into the security jig at foundation.jabber.org.  We're just
now starting to look at these things.
