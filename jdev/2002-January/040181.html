<PRE>No one has responded to this on the jadmin list, and the only occurance 
I've found in the archives has no resolution. I'm not sure where to start 
in resolving this, but I definitely need a solution.

I have a problem where almost all my users have all the text on a line 
disappear following a quote (single or double) or a handfull of other
characters. Other clients without the problem can still see all of the 
message.

This wasn't a problem as each person started using Jabber, but once it
happens, we can't seem to fix it. We've tried restarting the client,
rebooting the machines (Win2k), and even uninstalling and reinstalling
the clients. It seems to be a problem on the server end.

This happens mainly with the JIM client, and <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">support at jabber.com</A> suggests
upgrading the OSS server. I'm currently running 1.4.1, with conference
0.4.1, on Solaris 8.

This is rather frustrating, since it really prevents serious usage of
conferencing for any technical conversations. We even have to restrict
the use of contractions (it's, that's, etc) in sentences.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
John
