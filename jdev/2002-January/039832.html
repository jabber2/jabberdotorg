<PRE>All,

Can I ask if anyone has received any Cease-and-Disist type Emails from a company called Antepo relating to any products based on my KvmJab library. Antepo distribute a J2ME client based on my library and they seem to feel this means that other companies distributing similar products are in breach of their copyright.

I have been made aware of one company that has received an Email and I would like to be made aware of any other developers who have had the same strong-arm tactics attempted on them.

I have just revoked Antepos right to distribute any code based on my library until this issue is resolved, so I can assure anyone who has received such a message that Antepo have no basis for their cliams unless you have used code from the Uppli messanger which does not come as part of the software you can download from my site.

Please Email me off the list if you have had such an Email so I can judge the size of the problem.

Thanks,

Al.
