<PRE>We are running a version of the MSN transport here that works with
xdb_sql.  If you'd like to run it I can email a tarball to you, but it
won't be easy to set up.  There are quite a few things you have to do to
xdb_sql before it will work with it.  You'll have to add a table to your
mySQL db, add query definitions to the xdb_sql.xml file and there was a
bug in xdb_sql that prevented the msn transport from working correctly
with it that we fixed.  I don't know if this bug has been fixed in the
newest version of xdb_sql or not.  The bug was due to the fact that the
msn transport sends values to xdb as attributes of an xml tag instead of
as children tags I think.  It may have been the other way around.  This
functionality was broken in version 1.1 of xdb_sql, if it was fixed I'm
sure the maintainer will chime in.  If it hasn't been fixed I need to
send him our fix.  If you want to give it a shot let me know.  Just
realize that it will be pretty complicated.

Subject: [JDEV] Mysql and transports
 
I have installes xdb_sql succesfully? 
Everything is working but transports, I cannot make MSN nor AIM to work,
winjab disconnects when I try to browse the agent... and then it
hangs... with colinjab is the same, and psi for linux also...
With jabber users everything is fine... 
Any clue?
