<PRE>&gt;<i> no, but we can come into this conclusion in few months. 
</I>&gt;<i> As commercial server has almost everything - and oss has just the
</I>&gt;<i> basic functionalities. 
</I>
Completly untrue, in fact, in many way it is exactly the opposite of that,
the open source 1.4 server has newer protocol support, more
options/features, and wider platform support as well.

&gt;<i> I've seen already some responses here saying
</I>&gt;<i> that - for this or for that you need to go and buy commercial server. 
</I>
Jabber, Inc.'s commercial server has better scalability, higher rate of
throughput, oracle/ldap integration, and is really targetted at large
scale enterprises and service providers.  

If you want features, flexibility, the latest protocol development and
prototyping support, and something that can be molded fairly easily into
many environments you'll find it in open source.  It's also getting better
on the scalibility and will likely improve as more people need to push it
further and can help with the development in that area.

&gt;<i> yes, and i was thinking about this already. But the problem is that
</I>&gt;<i> people want's to have addresses like <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">pippo at hotmail.com</A> not
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">pippo at s1.p2.rn45.hotmail.com</A> . Because this will be needed in the
</I>&gt;<i> future if your system will grow.
</I>
Hmm, I think your confused, Jabber works very much like email and your
address is <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at domain</A>, not <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at localmachiene.</A>
