<PRE>I sent this message to the jadmin list last week, but haven't received a 
reply so far. I just wanted to verify that this feature exists, and if so, 
how to set it up.
-

I was once told that groups could be created for distributed messaging,
but I've not found a way to set them up, or a client that appears to
support them. (I think I found something on the jabber.org web site a
while ago, but can't find it back.) The closest thing for the clients is
to send a list of users to someone else.

For example, if there are two groups of jabber users that work in two
separate departments of a company (groups ABC and DEF), I'd like to be
able to send a message to ABC or DEF, and it will go to all the members
of the respective group. Even if I could select multiple recipients, I
wouldn't want to select all their usernames each time I send a message
to everyone in a group.

Has this been implemented in the server or any clients? Is there another
name for it or a URL with more info? It certainly seems like too useful
of a feature to not have added it by now.

Thanks,
John
