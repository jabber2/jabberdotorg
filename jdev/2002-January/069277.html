I agree.  Connecting to an uncooperative service is one thing.  But actively
fighting, especially with some of the schemes being proposed here seem to be
crossing the line into active attack...  In particular, the denial of
service scenarios being considered are just plain evil.

There are business and political pressures that can be brought to bear and
they should be.  I imagine that companies using Jabber will be highly
motivated to do so and would hope we see some leadership from them in this
area (hint hint).

&gt;<i>From a community standpoint, our primary tools should be standards and
</I>technical excellence.  We must make it in everyone's best interests to join
us rather than fight us... Jabber isn't there yet but we should be spending
our efforts on that rather than attacking AOL or any others for acting like
800 pound gorillas.  They are 800 pound gorillas and are acting in their own
best interests.  We simply need to shift the landscape so that their best
interests and ours align.  Our discussions should be aimed at ideas,
technologies, and businesses that target that shift.
