<PRE>There is no SMTP, that is there is no clear cut standard.  The IETF has
proved themselves to be incapable of producing one as well, so we have a
competing market of IM providers.  All those providers want to grab as
many eyes as possible for whatever their means are.  There are clients
that work for all systems (gaim and Trillian come to mind), but you
can't message between systems.  A user has to be established on each
network just like with Jabber.  Until we get a common standard that's
the way it's going to be.  Who knows, maybe we'll become a de facto
standard =)

P.S. - It's not about ads, I don't think it ever has been for any of
them.
