<PRE>I don't know if many people expect me to say this, but I'm totally
against trying get around the AOL blocks. 

This issue has fully fallen into the political realm and I don't
see a political and easy resolution coming together any time soon.
Really if I were an admin at AOL and I saw a group putting together a
massive network to connect entities to my system I immediately think
attack.  Sure it may not be used in that manner, but that's what it
boils down to.  What would you consider a network of computers
attempting to connect to your server?  Especially on a single port.  It
is their network, and their resources, and I feel we need to respect
that.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for openly discussing the issue with
AOL, especially if there are some people we can talk to that will make a
difference.

On the note of having the data redirected out through the client, I
think that's a horrid step away from most of the Jabber design and
principle.  Are we going to step back and redesign major pieces every
time we have a political mismatch?  I don't think so.

I've personally left AIM.  I can't stand it anymore.  My friends that
won't convert, well I'll email them.  If there were ever a solution where
AIM was a full member of the jabber network (think <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at aim.aol.com</A>, or
some such) then I would graciously accept them, but until then I will
just accept AOLs wishes and move on.
