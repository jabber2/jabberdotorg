&gt;<i> I do care that Jabber does well. For me, Jabber is a community that includes

</I>&gt;<i> etc., open source clients WinJab, etc., proprietary clients like Jabber IM,
</I>&gt;<i> Vista, etc., clients libraries, server modules, innovative stuff like
</I>&gt;<i> Jogger, etc. and finally the end users who use Jabber. From the technical
</I>&gt;<i> side we are bound by the Jabber specification. So Jabber to me is MORE then
</I>&gt;<i> just an Open Source project. I think this is the view in the Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> community also, but if I am wrong, please correct me.
</I>
yes, you're right. This is jabber community. But to let it grow
we will have to let all the components grow or we will finish only
with free clients and some products that we can buy.


&gt;<i> With regard to my comment on JCS, my position is connecting to a Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> server (whether open source or not) is better then connecting to an AOL
</I>&gt;<i> server. Using a client supporting the Jabber protocol (whether open source
</I>&gt;<i> or not) is better then using the AIM client. Both the actions GROW the
</I>&gt;<i> jabber community, so if I want to use the open source versions of either the
</I>&gt;<i> client or server, I can MAKE that choice. With the CLOSED AOL AIM protocol,
</I>&gt;<i> that choice is not possible.
</I>
Of course but in a world where only people running small lans with
few dozens of users maximum use the open source server and all the
others have to buy commercial server.

no, but we can come into this conclusion in few months. 
As commercial server has almost everything - and oss has just the
basic functionalities. I've seen already some responses here saying
that - for this or for that you need to go and buy commercial server. 
And no discussion to change it in a way that people can download
free version with these features. 


&gt;<i> I never said in my email that we need to stop development of the server. I
</I>&gt;<i> support your desire to for Jabber to be 'the best server'. All I said were
</I>&gt;<i> two things with regards to the Jabber server, which I am expanding and
</I>&gt;<i> repeating here
</I>

&gt;<i> 1. If the Jabber server is used in a distributed fashion like sendmail and
</I>&gt;<i> Apache, then that reduces the scalability requirement
</I>
yes, and i was thinking about this already. But the problem is that
people want's to have addresses like <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">pippo at hotmail.com</A> not
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">pippo at s1.p2.rn45.hotmail.com</A> . Because this will be needed in the
future if your system will grow.

I found that we could use some kind of a gateway -
people connect to one server ( for example jabbber.org ) autheticate - 
get a token/session id - and then continue with a server 
l1.l4.dddljfds.jabbber.org that are real jabber servers.
The external traffic goes always trough the main gateway
jabbber.org and the internal traffic is going between machines
that knows that l1.l4.dddljfds.jabber.org and l2.l4.dddljfds.jabber.org
are in this same domain. The advantage is that
noone have to know about our internat structure, for the external
users we will always look like <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at jabbber.org.</A>

&gt;<i> 2. For ISPs that demand more scalability, let them use JCS, etc. now instead
</I>&gt;<i> of choosing some closed solution like Odigo or co-branding AOL, Yahoo, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> That way, when the jabber server meets their requirements, they can adopt it
</I>&gt;<i> easily.
</I>
How somebody can adopt closed source software ?
Reverse engineer ?
Yes you are right but in my opionion if you choose
closed source software you go for closed solution.
As you don't have possibility to change tcp/ip stack
on M$ Windows you will not have possibility to modify
anything inside JCS.
