<PRE>I'm sorry I missed most of this thread.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Last I heard, they were having trouble with the s2s setup.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Primarily the fact that servers doing dialback would try 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and contact go.com but their IM is running on im.go.com.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The in-ability to reroute the traffic within the Jabber 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standards without resorting to DNS workarounds had been a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bit of a bummer.
</I> 
&gt;<i> I believe this is not correct, anymore. They are using some sort of 
</I>&gt;<i> redirector on their network to route the packets. When they 
</I>&gt;<i> first brought up the server, it was on im.go.com, but now that its 
</I>&gt;<i> basically live, they have moved everything over to use just go.com and 
</I>&gt;<i> use a layer 4 switch to route the traffic to the correct host. (At 
</I>&gt;<i> least, that is my assumption.)
</I>
We would really love to have the server-to-server stuff running.  I thought
that we were waiting for the abber.com commercial s2s  software to be
completed 
before we could set it up.  I know in the past there was some issues with
Our network setup, but I had thought those were resolved.  I'll ask my boss
what is going on.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; I think they had the ability to do the technical hack but preferred to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; try and create an elegant solution rather than rush it.  In addition, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their primary goal is to provide IM between disney users so s2s isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the number one priority...  My impression is their IM team is very 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; small so most of the effort is going into the disney client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're probably right on the issue of the IM team being small, and
</I>
&gt;<i> I know they have tried to get S2S (SCM) working, however, like many other 
</I>&gt;<i> corporate networks, they are worried about potential abuses on their 
</I>&gt;<i> network from external servers. (At least, that is my impression.)
</I>
Team?  Its really just me with some parttime design support and the 
Occasional  Help from network operations.
 
&gt;<i> Hopefully they'll get S2S (SCM) up and running soon as I think it would
</I>add 
&gt;<i> a lot to the Jabber community.
</I>
I really hope so too!

BTW, its been a while since I've done a release.  I'm almost ready to make
a new release that will include support for message history SSL the new
text-conferencing, etc.
