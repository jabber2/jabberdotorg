&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: Aaron McBride [mailto:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">amcbride at verbots.com</A>] 
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [JDEV] Disney Jabber Client
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After poking around some more, I've found that there is an 
</I>&gt;<i> option where you can set the server you want to use (under 
</I>&gt;<i> the Tools menu).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They could make it a little more obvious how to select a 
</I>&gt;<i> different server by putting it on the login form, but I guess 
</I>&gt;<i> I could understand why they wouldn't. (They'd want to know that 
</I>&gt;<i> their users are on their servers that and they are going to be 
</I>&gt;<i> kept running, right?)
</I>
The only reason its not easier to configure that is because I
haven't spent the time to make it easier.   I've thought about
Making it so that if a person types in &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">foo at jabber.com</A>&quot; as their
Username, then I would connect to &quot;jabber.com&quot;.  The only problem
I have is I need to know what server the user plans on connecting
to before I show that sign-in window.

You probably didn't notice this, but when the client is configured
to connect to &quot;go.com&quot;, the login dialog has two links under the
Password field.  One called &quot;Register for a free account&quot; and
The other is &quot;Forgot your account info&quot;?  If you click on one of
These you are taken to the appropriate go.com website.   When
The client is configured to connect to a server other then &quot;go.com&quot;,
Those links are replaced by a checkbox titled &quot;Create a new account&quot;.

Our Jabber user database is linked up to a DIG (Disney Internet Group)
Database that includes users from go.com, ESPN.com, disney.com,
ABCNews.com, etc.  So you cannot create a new account through the 
jabber server, you have to go through the webpages.  

&gt;<i> PS - I just found the debug menu in the client too.  Now that's 
</I>&gt;<i> a nice feature. :)  (more props to the authors)
</I>
Thanks,

-Robert
