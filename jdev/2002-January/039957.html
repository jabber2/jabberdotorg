<PRE>I'm not going to go into all the litigation (or lack of) against
companies, but this move is completely consistent with previous actions
by AOL.  Remember the MSN days?  Remember Odigo?  There have also been
some other isolated cases, so there is a precedent for what they are
trying to do.  They set a level of what their service involves and who
can use it and so far it seems that any entity that is of a certain
size, and IM related, attempting to connect to the network has been
blocked.  We have to respect that, especially if we want to be respected
as well.

I'm not against a public statement.  It would also have more clout from
a public company, but it has to be made carefully.  Before a statement
is made I would strongly suggest the company has been blocked, you have
attempted to talk with AOL and resolve the conflict, and it's not pulled
into the larger Jabber scope.  This is a political problem, not a
technical one, and it needs to stay in that arena.
