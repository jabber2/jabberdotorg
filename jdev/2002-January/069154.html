<PRE>Update. I am finding that you can get better compression ratios, up to
around 57%, by maintaining the LZ dictionary between packets. Also this
reduces the processor hit asymptotically (but still quite nonzero) with
more packets sent along.

This technique raises still other problems, though, most notably
reliability. For this to work the gzip deflater on one end and the inflater
on the other end must remain exactly in sync for the duration of the
connection (hours, days, ...). An error in the compressed stream would be
magnified many times over in the inflated stream. So for reliability you
had better hash or at least checksum all the data going across. That means
you have to have an envelope format.

So for bandwidth and processor usage, this does a lot better than I
expected compared to my original run, but now we are just a few steps away
(credential verification, key exchange, and stream encryption) from
re-doing SSL.

Hi Adam, I looked over some of the DotGNU mailing list archives at the
discussion you are referring to.

One person from DotGNU says
---
At the end of the day, it is easier to just gzip it and forget about
the problem.  No data loss, and roughly the same level of
compaction.  Highly redundant data like XML compresses
very well.  For example, the 6 Mb All.xml file for the C#
library specification compresses to ~630k using gzip: about
10% of the original size.
---
I believe this is misleading in the context of realtime XML streams (e.g.
Jabber; SOAP; presumably, whatever DotGNU will use) because you are not
compressing 6Mb of data at once. Rather you are compressing small packets,
a few hundred bytes in length in the case of Jabber, and then transmitting
them individually. I ran some tests to see how gzip performs under these
conditions.

I wrote a program which generates random Jabber &lt;message/&gt; packets. The
body of each message is formed by randomly selecting between 1 and 25 words
from a 10,000-word English language dictionary file. For each test vector,
the program runs zlib compress, level 9, on it (equivalent [I think] to
gzip with maximum compression), then records the compressed size and the
original size. It repeats this until at least 1 million bytes of
uncompressed data has been processed.

The results from about a dozen runs of this program are very consistent: a
compression ratio of 17% in 7 seconds of runtime. A typical result is
1,000,011 total bytes of raw data; 830,654 bytes of compressed data.

If I comment the code to compress the test vectors, and leave the code to
generate the test vectors, the program runs in less than 1 second.

[This was run on]
athena% uname -a
SunOS department-of-alchemy.mit.edu 5.8 Generic_108528-08 sun4u sparc
SUNW,Ultra-60
athena%

Obviously these are preliminary and nonscientific results only, and there
are other factors to consider with Jabber, such as the likelihood
previously mentioned that the XML processing is going to be the limiting
factor in processor time. I find the topic quite interesting, however, so I
am going to fiddle around with it over the next few days and see if I can
get it to do better with custom deflate dictionaries and such. Hopefully I
will even find time to write something on the topic and post it with my
source code. However, based on these initial results I am very wary of
gzipping instant messaging XML because of the apparent high processing cost
and mediocre compression ratio. I will continue to test but my hypothesis
is that gzip or any generic compression algorithm is going to be very
mediocre for Jabber as instant messaging.

Hi, all. There's a good discussion going on over at the DotGNU Developer
list about gzip'ing the XML that is transmitted around on the DotGNU
platform.

Was wondering if it would be possible to incorporate the same thing for
future versions of the Jabber server? Is it feasible, anyway? They are
saying the trade-offs for extra resource consumption would not be bad at
all if designed into the server properly, and would reduce bandwidth
very dramatically (like by 80%, i think). This would be useful for
high-volume servers with enough processing power, i think...
