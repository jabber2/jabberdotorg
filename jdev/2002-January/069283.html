</I>I am far from an expert on transports but I was where you are at a few 
months ago. The best way to learn this stuff is to simply get your hands 
dirty. There is an example_transport somewhere that is good place to start. 
Grab the code for it, install it and then annotate the hell out of it so 
that you can see what messages it handles and so on. From there you should 
be able to begin to build your own transport to do whatever it is you want 
it to.  That is exactly what I did and now I have a couple of transports 
built and running.  Begin with very simple code that will handle the jabber 
protocol as it comes to your transport and then begin to provide logic to 
handle those portions that you need and ignore that which you don't.

I built my transports to link to jabber via socket connections rather than 
as loadable modules because it lets me run them wherever I want and jabber 
will simply connect to them (as set up in the jabber xml config.

The transports I have written provide call handling via an IM client, so 
that users can make, receive, conference, etc. all by interacting with a 
smart buddy. They are fairly complicated pieces of code today but their 
architecture is simple and they began by understanding the example 
transport and then applying the lessons learned to my own code.

Others may have better suggestions but this approach worked well for me. I 
have even been mucking around with modules to do things that will enhance 
the behavior of the transports without upsetting the normal jabber IM 
communications. Once you get dirty with this stuff it all starts to fall 
into place but it does have a bit of learning curve to get going.

Good luck.
