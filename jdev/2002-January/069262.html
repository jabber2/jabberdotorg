<PRE>I think you'll find what we have with IM is what happened with Email a
long time ago (well, long time in computing speak).

It used to be the case that you had;

- UUCP
- Various BBS systems (with their own Email systems Fido, 
- X400
- SMTP

All of which needed bridging products to send mail between the systems.

As IM matures as a system I think you'll find people converge on one
standard and bridge to their internal IM solutions internally, as
opposed to what we have at the moment.

In in the case of Email SMTP was the protocol people converged on, lets
hope it's jabber with IM.
