That's good.  I was only keeping up with them when they were in beta and
rolling out the system for testing.  I was curious to see how the rollout
went and the kinds of issues they were running into.  Now that its in
production use its not as interesting... (A well oiled machine is kind of
boring...)  :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> primary goal is to provide IM between disney users so s2s isn't the number

</I>
Yes.  I have been wondering about those issues (many of which are
political/business/legal and not technical).  For example, are there
&quot;rights&quot; to Jabber s2s access, service level agreements, usage policies,
etc.

&gt;<i> Hopefully they'll get S2S (SCM) up and running soon as I think it would add
</I>&gt;<i> a lot to the Jabber community.
</I>
I agree.  In addition, it would be interesting to see how well it works in
practice with such a large new addition to the Jabber network.  Hopefully it
won't be like the Gnutella meltdown...  ;)
