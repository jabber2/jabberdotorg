<PRE>I think one thing we could do is go to the ISPs with an open book and
say &quot;What would you want from an IM service?&quot;, don't say yes or no to
anything (except the things we already have), and then start forming a
to-do list from it. 

The list from Mike Lin can act as a start, but we need people going to
these companies asking what they want to fill it out.

Is anyone doing this/thinking of doing this?
