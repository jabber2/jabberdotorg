This happens automatically for presence.  So if all you need to do is send
some short message, you could use presence (just setup a &quot;status user&quot; and
set their presence message to whatever the message it is that you want to
propagate).  This is useful if you only want to alert people to check their
emails or go to a meeting or something like that.

Otherwise, this is something that either:

The client implements (like an email mailing group) - I don't know of a
client that does this.  This is more &quot;email&quot; style functionality and I don't
know of any Jabber clients that favor email-like interactions (although I've
only looked a few so there are probably some out there).

Create a groupchat group - use standard groupchat (conferences).  Setup a
group, then have everyone join it.  Any message sent to the group will get
relayed to everyone in the group.

Hope that helps...
