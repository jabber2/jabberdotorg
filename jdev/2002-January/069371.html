I believe this is not correct, anymore. They are using some sort of 
redirector on their network to route the packets. When they first brought 
up the server, it was on im.go.com, but now that its basically live, they 
have moved everything over to use just go.com and use a layer 4 switch to 
route the traffic to the correct host. (At least, that is my assumption.)

I think you're probably right on the issue of the IM team being small, and 
I know they have tried to get S2S (SCM) working, however, like many other 
corporate networks, they are worried about potential abuses on their 
network from external servers. (At least, that is my impression.)

Hopefully they'll get S2S (SCM) up and running soon as I think it would add 
a lot to the Jabber community.
