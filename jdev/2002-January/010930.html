<PRE>Greetings Jabberites!

As you may be aware, the Jabber Software Foundation has a mechanism for
adding to the Jabber protocol, known as Jabber Enhancement Proposals or
JEPs (<A HREF="http://foundation.jabber.org/jeps/">http://foundation.jabber.org/jeps/</A>). In the past these JEPs have
been sent directly to the Jabber Council without prior discussion in the
Jabber community. Based on last week's JSF discussion (visit the log at
<A HREF="http://perl.jabber.org/logs/conference.jabber.org/foundation/2002-01-16.html">http://perl.jabber.org/logs/conference.jabber.org/foundation/2002-01-16.html</A>
for details), we have modified the JEP process to facilitate more feedback
and discussion. Authors are now sending their JEPs to the JEP Editor
(i.e., me) and I am publishing them as &quot;Experimental&quot; proposals before I
send them to the Jabber Council. The intent is to discuss and improve the
proposal within the Jabber community before seeking to advance the JEP to
the status of a draft standard. In cases where we don't have a dedicated
Jabber Interest Group for the JEP's topic, we will be discussing it in the
Standards JIG. Each new JEP will be announced on the JDEV and members
lists, but the discussion will occur on the mailing list for the Standards
JIG. So if you want to provide feedback on proposed extensions and changes
to the Jabber protocol, I urge you to join the Standards JIG mailing list
by visiting <A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/standards-jig">http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/standards-jig</A>

This week I have cleared out my queue and have published 6 new JEPs. There
are some important protocol topics being addressed here so I encourage
anyone who is interested to join the Standards JIG list and get active!
The new JEPs are as follows (or see the list at
<A HREF="http://foundation.jabber.org/jeps/jeplist.html">http://foundation.jabber.org/jeps/jeplist.html</A>):

0011 - Jabber Browsing (jabber:iq:browse)
0012 - Last Activity (jabber:iq:last)
0013 - POP3 Handling of Offline Messages
0014 - Message Tone
0015 - Account Transfer
0016 - Server-Based Privacy Rules

Let the discussion begin! :)

Peter

P.S. Some of the above JEPs were published before we came up with the
&quot;Experimental&quot; status, so they may be re-labeled next week...
