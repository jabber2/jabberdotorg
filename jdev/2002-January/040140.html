<PRE>Hi, 
&gt;<i> Hey all it's about time for a new development cycle for jabberd. 
</I>Love to read that  - I am a fan of the Jabber concept.

Do you consider modifying the protocol ? 
I will join the effort on XML standards compliance as well. 

  
To me, the fact that Jabber is not fully compliant to XML standards
(namespaces for exemple) slows down the expansion of Jabber, as well as  the
lack of rigourous documentations and specifications. 

---This is what you can read on Jabber.org/ welcome page : 
&quot;The result? Jabber is quickly becoming a standard  component of Internet
infrastructure.&quot; 
--is it really true ? 

Preceding messages  (on protocole, error codes, or component architecture
for exemple) show that there is a demand for such docs and specs. 
A lot of messages sent to this list are questions that could be answered in
proper specification or documentation on Jabber.



That is why I propose you to also enhance the effort on documentation. 

I know that there are many  many things to do on Jabber,  
that documenting and specifying are time consuming tasks, 
and that Jabber developpers have only two fingers, one brain et two eyes... 
and like all developpers (from which I am) they prefer coding than writing
clear specification --  that's already in their head... 
But when you have to answer to questions you also loose time !


But when you intend to widely spread your techno over the world -- and want
people to build their software based upon your techno - please  consider
that documentation would ease their job, thus the adoption of your techno.
And if they can easily use it -- without having to read your code to
understand how to do --, the techno will really become a standard component
of Internet infrastructure. 

Well, I would like to...that's why I wrote you these kindly unpleasant
remarks... 
  


best regards,
