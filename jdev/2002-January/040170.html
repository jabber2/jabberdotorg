<PRE>You could actually accomplish roughly the same thing with much less effort by
writing a small bot to listen on a set of AIM screennames, using them almost
analogously to ports on an IPMasq firewall.  If an AIM user initiates a
conversation with one of the screennames being listened on, the bot reads the
first message (which would simply be a JID) to find out whom the AIM user wants
to chat with.  Once the AIM user has started a chat with a Jabber user, the bot
can keep forwarding messages from that AIM user to the same JID until the
conversation is over (which may be triggered by any number of events, including
an explicit &quot;:done:&quot; message, a loss of presence by either the Jabber user or
the AIM user, a sufficiently long pause, etc.).  Making this type of bot would
be substantially easier than coding a whole AIM proxy server, _and_ figuring out
how to change the AIM server in your AIM client.  Not only that, but AIM Express
and AIM QuickBuddy users would also be able to chat with Jabber users if we
employ the bot described above instead of an AIM proxy.  This solution also
allows us to stay within the AIM protocol, so if AOL decides to change the AIM
interface so that [%@] aren't accepted into text boxes asking for screennames,
we won't have to hack it to avoid rejecting those characters.

Just my two cents,
Dave Cohen
