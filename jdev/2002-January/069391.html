<PRE>&gt;<i> I had a SRV record on my domain pointing to my Jabber server but S2S
</I>&gt;<i> only worked with a few other servers (like Jabber.org). I thought that
</I>&gt;<i> was because it was new and not supported by most servers yet, but I
</I>&gt;<i> assume most servers are 1.2+. Could it have been a set up issue and
</I>&gt;<i> what possibly could it have been?
</I>
Yes, most or all of the servers are 1.2 or newer.  It should be working
fine, I know of a few other servers that are set up this way and work.  
There were a few issues in the early days of SCM that caused bugs when
doing SRV, but those have been fixed for some time (a month or two).

There was one bug fixed just yesterday (it's in cvs and will be in the
1.4.2 release) in the dialback module, which should cause a crash on
particular platforms if anything, but I guess there's a remote chance it
could just cause flakyness (memory being free'd but still referenced in a
hash table for a few cycles).  If you can reproduce any other connectivity
issues between two servers when SRV is involved, email me with any of the
data and I'll check it out.

&gt;<i> Also, are MX records still supported?
</I>
They were a really ugly &quot;hack&quot;, and only used by the 1.0 server :)
