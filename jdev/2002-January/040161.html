<PRE>I did some testing with this and I had some problems where it appeared to be
overrunning the buffers, can't say for sure as I was not given the time to
track down the problem.  It simply locked up my jabberd process and that is
my best guess.  This was when there was a heavy load where I had four
processes using the jabber test suite to create 4000 simultaneous
connections.  Somewhere around 700 connections I would get the lock up.
Sorry I can't be more specific, but even if it hadn't locked up I saw a huge
latency in logins when I had a separate xdb process so Ben is absolutely
correct in that it is very inefficient.

It appears that in all the discussions of &quot;The Important Things&quot;, your
message got lost in the shuffle. Yes. It is possible to run an
&quot;xdb&quot; component in an external Jabber process, although I wouldn't
necessarily recommend it. To do this, simply use &lt;accept&gt; in your &lt;xdb&gt;
configuration and set it up as you would any other external component.

The reason I would discourage this is that it is fairly inefficient as all
data going to the &lt;xdb&gt; component would need to be serialized into xml,
sent across the socket and then unserialized on the other end... which is
quite a bit of overhead compared to just passing around the data in
memory.

Is their a specific reason you're trying to externalize an xdb component?
