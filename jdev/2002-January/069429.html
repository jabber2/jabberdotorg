<PRE>Hi German,

Just curious. Are you going to release your code under an open-source
licence? Actually, there are several OSS java client projects, but none are
really finished products. Why don't all of you gather on the same project?

Thanks

Philippe Raxhon

     Thanks very muche Peter!.

     I comment my case. I need to make a messenger with support to a
     internal
     protocol form my mates(I see in Jabber a good point). But today I need
     communication to my clients to.

     I don't have any problem to make bloking on the client side. But when
     I
     send an unavailable because of the previous presence, they see me for
     a
     glance.

     I try to keep the block list in the server. But I don't know how!

     Apart of that. I try to make messagin to MSN too. I see that sending
     and
     unavailable to a MSN buddy must result in a block. But it work only
     with
     all of the client (sending a presence without to:) I don't know if it
     is
     a bug or what.

     Thanks again!

          I'm implementing a Jabber client over Java, then I fault into two
          problems

                     1- How block a user like MSN Messenger.

     Blocking communications from specific JIDs is usually done
     client-side.
     There is no Jabber protocol for this.

                     2- How define a name to show in the roster of each
          buddy that
          see my presence.

     When you add a roster item, you can include a 'name' attribute, like
     so:

     &lt;iq type=&quot;set&quot; id=&quot;uniquevalue&quot;&gt;
       &lt;query xmlns=&quot;jabber:iq:roster&quot;&gt;
         &lt;item jid=&quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">romeo at montague.net</A>&quot;
             name=&quot;Romeo&quot;
             subscription=&quot;none&quot;
             ask=&quot;subscribe&quot;&gt;
           &lt;group&gt;friends&lt;/group&gt;
         &lt;/item&gt;
       &lt;/query&gt;
     &lt;/iq&gt;

     However, AFAIK there is no way to suggest to your &quot;buddy&quot; what that
     name
     attribute should include.

     Technically, you should be giving each message (or ones that you're
     waiting
     on a reply for) a different ID rather than the same ID.  The way I do
     it
     is
     to have a global ID counter that increments every time it is
     called.  Jabber IM uses a string-based unique ID approach.  Any way
     works
     as long as the ID can be unique within your own context.

     Thanks,
     Chris

          hello,

          i was wondering if there is a way to send an id/key element to
          the the
     server
          which the server will return in it's reply on a iq packet by
          packet
     basis.
          basically, my concern is that some replies from the server simply
     return
          something like &lt;iq type=&quot;result&quot; id=&quot;1001&quot;/&gt; to signal a
          successful iq
          operation.  however, if i have different components listening for
          iq
     packets,
          but in different contexts then it's not possible for my listeners
          to
     know
          when the success signal was meant for them or not.  is there some
          other
          mechanism that i can use for this?

          for a concrete example i have a listener that waits for the
          return iq
     packet
          after authenticating, jabber:iq:auth, which returns  &lt;iq type
          =&quot;result&quot;
          id=&quot;1001&quot;/&gt; for success and another listener that listens for iq
     packets for
          jabber:iq:private which can also return &lt;iq type=&quot;result&quot; id
          =&quot;1001&quot;/&gt;.
     my
          intent was for each listener to get both packets and to leave it
          up to
     the
          listeners to filter out the packets their interested in.

          any help with this would be appreciated.

          zak.
