<PRE>What if we setup a network of &quot;socket redirectors&quot; (SR) to proxy the
connection to AOL????

This is the url for one such existing open source tool. (I've never used
it)

<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/apps/AppId_6615.html">http://www.linux.org/apps/AppId_6615.html</A>
&quot;aproxy is a multi-client application to forward TCP connections from
(local) listening ports to remote targets somewhere in your network.
aproxy works with all TCP-services that use a single TCP-Connection for
client/server communication&quot;

When any transport needs to needs to connect to AOL it asks the SR to
create the connection. Then all connections would be seen to come from
the SR's ip address. If Aol of anyone else for that matter, blocks that
ip address the SR detects that and deallocates itself. 

 
Its unlikely that AOL would disable these connections since any company
that uses AIM across a firewall has all the users coming from the single
ip address. AOL would have not way to differentiate our gateway from
users inside of a firewall. (I think?) 

We should create a pool of these SR's know as a &quot;socket redirector
allocator&quot; (SRA). 

The jabber development effort would be as follows: 

1) Create the &quot;socket redirector allocator&quot;. This server would be
contacted by each SR when it comes online, or when it detects that it
has been disabled or is too busy.  It would also be contacted by each
transport when it wants the address of a free SR.  Its could be based on
the existing JUD code.
2) Modify an existing open source SR such that it will register with the
SRA.  
3) Modify the Aim transport to contact the SRA for a connection and then
go to the SR for the connection.

Benefits to this approach: 
1) No modifications to existing clients. 
2) No modifications to jabber server
3) Minor modifications to each transport 

Drawbacks:
1) A bit of a hack to say the least. 
2) Increased latency would be introduced to each connection. 
3) It would be easy for someone to snoop on all IM conversations going
thought a SR that they setup.

I don't know, it's a bit complex, but this would solve the problem for
good. (I hope!!??) 

Eventually AOL will give up and we can remove the whole thing and go
back to busness an normal.

Any comments?
