<PRE>There is a very simple reason why any approach like this is doomed to
failure.  

As far as I can tell, the technique AOL is/was using to track the IPs
being used by aim.jabber.org was that they had a dummy AIM account and
registered the transport to use it via jabber like any normal user does.
Either they just used a normal client to do this or script with a jabber
module. Once aim.jabber.org logged into AOL w/ that dummy account, they
would examine the source IP for that client connection (I'm sure they
regularly block abusive users/IPs and this action is quite easy with their
administrative tools).

The entire thing could be automated on their side, and it would only take
a very short amount of time to obliterate any network of aim transports or
socket redirectors.

I fully agree, this battle isn't one for the technology, our technical
resources are better spent improving Jabber, and if anyone has political
resources those are probably best spent showing the world why a commons
for communication platforms is so important over closed
commercial/corporate networks.
