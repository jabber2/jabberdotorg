I haven't got time to go into detail right now but I've thought about
this myself for some time now. I'd suggest that you take a look at the
Annotea system at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/">http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/</A> if you don't know that
yet. It's a LEAD (Live Early Adoption and Demonstration) project of the
W3C to &quot;[enhance] the W3C  collaboration environment with shared
annotations.&quot; It's based on RDF and other W3C standards obviously and is
part of the Semantic Web activity. I almost started to write an
implementation that uses the Jabber network instead of HTTP requests to
fetch annotations from an Annotea server but then didn't get around to
actually do it after all.

Feel free to mail me off the list but I can't promise I will answer
promptly right now as I'm busy finishing my master thesis which is due
soon and don't have much time to spare.

bye,
Jan
