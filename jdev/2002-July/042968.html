Subject: [standards-jig] JEP-0037

I have received a new version of JEP-0037 from &quot;Bac9&quot;, one of the
co-authors, and I have posted this new version on the JEPs page of the
website. At the same time, I have removed two of the co-authors from the
authors list for this JEP, at their request. From now on, this JEP must be
attributed only to the remaining co-authors, and questions regarding it
must directed only to them. Unfortunately, this is made more difficult by
the fact that the main author remaining (who goes only by the name of
&quot;Bac9&quot;) refuses to join this mailing list and therefore cannot engage in
the discussions of his JEP within the recognized forum.

Because the co-authors came to disagree about the direction this spec
should take, I have allowed &quot;Bac9&quot; to continue with DSPS only in the
interest of avoiding a fork of this protocol. It is quite possible that
one or more of the former co-authors will create a new protocol (in
concert with others) to address part or all of the same problem set
addressed by the current DSPS. Therefore as JEP Editor I have little
option but to strongly discourage developers from implementing DSPS at
this time, at least until this mess gets sorted out.

Rest assured that changes will be made to JEP-0001 to avoid this kind of
debacle from occurring again. I will make some recommendations regarding
co-author disagreement and protocol forking. I will most certainly be
strengthening the description of author responsibilities so that authors
must be members of the relevant mailing list (usually this list, unless we
bring back specialized JIGs). I will also no longer accept JEPs from
authors who do not identify themselves (i.e., first name and last name
will be required fields). And I may make other changes as appropriate (of
course with due discussion).

If you have concerns regarding this JEP or my decision in this regard,
please direct them to me (on list or off) as you see fit.

Thanks.

Peter
