<PRE>&gt;<i> More precisely, 'porting' means that I dump all the pool, xmlnode
</I>&gt;<i> etc. stuff (AFAIK, this is the old libxode) in favour of apr_pool_t,
</I>&gt;<i> apr_xml_elem etc. (reason is: I will use apr anyway as a portability
</I>&gt;<i> layer for threads, file IO etc and want to avoid two different memory
</I>&gt;<i> pool mechanisms etc.).  AFAICT, four files will be 'ported: jid.c,
</I>&gt;<i> jpacket.c, jutil.c and perhaps xstream.c.
</I>
Ahh, interesting, shouldn't be too difficult, seeing as those peices of
code are very small and relatively self-contained.

&gt;<i> My only concern is the licensing.  By the use of apr I already have
</I>&gt;<i> the apache license there.  The four libjabber files are JOSL or GPL,
</I>
There shouldn't be a problem leaving them under the JOSL, but to be
honest, the code in those files isn't the best and I've always felt
they're in need of a rewrite anyway.  The jid one needs to be brought up
to spec to JEP 29, and the jpacket/jutil ones are dependent on the old
xmlnode dom and will have to be rewritten reguardless.

&gt;<i> building block for a new attempt to mod_jabber (which I won't do,
</I>&gt;<i> right now; the 'old' mod_jabber by Jeremie Miller seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> stalled).  
</I>
Yes, stalled but not forgotten.  It reached a point where it was actually
acting like a server, and I've been sidetracked since then.  Fortunately,
it's still high on my list, and with the code I started writing for the
jabberd 1.5 stuff earlier this summer it's done in such a way that much of
it will drop into the mod_jabber framework.  

&gt;<i> While we are at it, are the apr patches within mod_jabber already
</I>&gt;<i> submitted to the apr list?  If not, would you, the relevant people,
</I>&gt;<i> mostly Jeremie Miller I think, mind, if I submitted them?  And am I
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to submit those xml utilities like get_attr, set_attr (in a
</I>&gt;<i> suitable form) from mod_jabber:jpacket.c to apr likewise, if they
</I>&gt;<i> want them?
</I>
I don't think they are probably ready yet, and I'm not sure if any of that
has changed since then inside the apr.  If your interested in helping
flesh them out, just catch me online someday (jid:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jer at jabber.org</A>) and I'll
probably set up cvs and we can go from there.

Jer
