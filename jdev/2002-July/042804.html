<PRE>&gt;<i> What  we need would be all flash objects.
</I>
The libraries that I've developed are object oriented and provide a set of
top-level objects for each functional group of features (eg. presence ,
messaging , agents , roster etc.. ) .  I assume this is what you mean by
'Flash objects'. Flash 'objects' , strictly speaking, are simply named
instances of movie clips.  They aren't necessarily encapsulated or portable.

There's also the potential for deploying these libraries as Flash
'components' which would provide a somewhat cleaner interface to the methods
and properties of the top-level objects and prevent these from being
modified inadvertantly.  Developers can simply place the component in their
project , customize the UI , and they're ready to go.

re: email.
Flash media can be embedded into the body of an email using the MM ActiveX
control , or simply an embed tag. Any client developed using the libraries
can be delivered this way , though you need to know how to embed and address
the SWF properly.  When the user opens their email the Flash media is
presented just like it would be in a web page. This assumes that the user's
security restrictions don't prohibit ActiveX. This doesn't require any
additional support server side, though the socket connection from the email
would have to connect to the same domain as the SWF derives from if you're
using the F5 player. MX apparently enables you to connect to alternate
domains , but I haven't tested this yet.

What license would you be interested in releasing this under ?
