<PRE>Hi Thomas!

</I>The timeouts just default to a very long time. They can be configured 
with the sysctl interface (tcp_keepalive_probes and tcp_keepalive_time). 
At Linux you can also change the timeout by accessing the proc 
filesystem (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_*).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah I know. Even with Java there was a discussion if it should be 
implemented or not. But I think the bigger problem with OOB is that 
there was a big bug in windows. Older versions of Windows (pre Windows 
NT sp 4 I think) can be kicked by sending them OOB data. This has been 
fixed by Microsoft, but I expect that many unfixed Win95/98 are still 
out and we would kick our user's systems if the server starts sending OOB.
As far as I know OOB is also tracked by some intrusion detection systems 
and they will kick your connection if you use it with a protocol that is 
not known to use OOB (and I don't think Jabber is known by them). This 
would make it harder for our service to be used behind corporate firewalls.
