<PRE>(addendum to my &quot;Re: [JDEV] PHP-HTML based Jabber client&quot;)

Since I brought it up: anyone on this mailing list interested in hosting for 
rbjab? If you're worried about bandwidth because, for example, your ISP 
allows you a 1 gig upload max, rbjab will allow you to set any limit you 
want, such as 100 megs/month upload, and 300 megs/month download, or 
whatever. Anything that you don't use would be fine, and you don't have to be 
online 24/7. E-mail me at <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">rbjab at rebirth-rpg.com</A> if you are interested. Also, 
I'd appreciate full-time servers, and a reliable webhost which is personal 
enough for me to customize it quite a bit. I won't do anything that doesn't 
follow any restrictions you'd have in mind, such as webspace, allowed 
software and stuff like that, and I'd ask permission whenever there's 
something that could affect you. I'd also appreciate if the web host could 
host information for the game itself. It will interface with jabber, but 
other than that, the site would only have one section for rbjab, and the rest 
for the game. I'll continue maintaining rbjab, but finding a free or really 
low-cost host is impossible without striking up a deal on a personal level. 
Developing a free game with almost no income to be sacrificed on it is a very 
challenging task. I'll be willing to reciprocate in any free favor (link, 
game preview before everyone else, original art, etc.) we can both agree on. 
E-mail me please if you are interested: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">hosting at rebirth-rpg.com.</A>

If you want to talk to me about both rbjab and hosting, either e-mail will do.
