There is no standard way of manipulating keepalives. There is no 
standard set of system calls to configure keepalives. Keepalives may not 
be configurable per socket (they might be a machine-wide configurable, 
affecting all other services running on that machine) or configurable at 
all.

Also, keep in mind that the worst case timeout due to a keepalive is 
going to be around ten minutes, even if the keepalive interval is 
reduced down to one minute. This means someone who unplugs their modem 
may still take 10 minutes to timeout, and that any messages sent to them 
during this period will still be lost.
