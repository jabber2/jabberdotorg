<PRE>[Sorry about posting this to JDEV, but we don't have a Jabber Advocacy list]

Just a note to say that the Jabber service at dreamhost.com has gone live.
For those that are wanting a cheap hosting plan that also gives you a
managed Jabber server included in the price (starting at US$9.95/month) this
is probably a good place to start looking.  (Finally I have my email address
and my JID the same!)

Dreamhost currently host 44,845 domains, so that is a lot of (virtual)
Jabber servers that could be coming online very shortly.  You can read their
Jabber blurb here:

<A HREF="http://www.dreamhost.com/jabber.html">http://www.dreamhost.com/jabber.html</A>

If you come across any errors or problems with the servers, please report
them to the helpdesk.  The staff are really good at resolving issues and
getting back to you quickly, but they are fairly new to this whole Jabber
thing.

For those interesting in Jabber Advocacy - Jabber was a pretty easy sell to
Dreamhost.  When I first contacted them, they pretty obviously didn't know
what Jabber was or what it did, but it only took a few emails to convince
them to seriously consider it, and in a month or so they had a server
running internally for staff to use.  Now it's part of every hosting plan
they offer.  It's really nice when you find a company where the staff really
&quot;get it&quot;.  I'm hoping that we can use DH as an example to different ISP's
who haven't tested the waters yet...so, if you are with a different
webhosting company, now is perhaps a good time to contact them about their
future Jabber plans, and site DH as an example of what their competition is
offering.  If you want a hand with this, feel free to email me directly.

&lt;shamlessplug&gt;If anyone is signing up with DH, and want to support
development of the Yabber client, please feel free to put yabber.org down as
a referring domain, and we will get a discount off our
hosting&lt;/shamelssplug&gt;
