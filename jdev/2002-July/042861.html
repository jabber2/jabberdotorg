<PRE>Personally, I agree with modifying DSPS to *allow for* client-client
transfers.  On top of that, I don't see this being a big change,
either.  In fact (at a quick glance), the only thing I see needing to be
&quot;optional&quot; for this case is most of the administration traffic.

I think one thing that would significantly help this discussion is if
someone could provide some clarity feedback; how could this JEP be
better organized, etc.

    While I agree with your point, I personally don't think its as big of a
    problem as you think. Personally, I find it to be rather unlikely that any
    public Jabber servers will even run a DSPS component on their server, at
    least in a public environment. While I can see it getting used with
    corporate networks, because it provides useful abilities (read:
    multicast), anybody who's paying for bandwidth and running a public server
    won't want these &quot;virtual&quot; network connections to be causing increased
    load on their network.
    
    If you don't believe that, consider the behavior of every file sharing
    network out there. While some of these are true peer-to-peer (Gnutella,
    Kazaa?) and others use a hybrid peer-to-peer/server approach (Napster,
    eDonkey 2000) all of them share one thing in common, file transfer always
    take place peer-to-peer.
    
    I really think people are missing this larger issue in DSPS. That's why I
    would propose that the protocol be modified to be able to be used to
    negotiate peer-to-peer connections if possible, and use the
    client-server-client connections if necessary. Even in this case, I think
    any implementation of this protocol will need to have the ability to
    disabled server assisted file transfers (at the cost of potentially
    blocking some users from being able to establish a &quot;stream&quot;), otherwise it
    will never be adopted by companies that have to pay for their bandwidth
    and are running public servers.

    &gt; I dont think you quite get the point, ordinary NAT servers (without port

    &gt; But using DSPS people inside a NAT can setup servers that people outside can
    &gt; connect to (that is its function afterall) via the proxy'd socket on the
    &gt; DSPS server bypassing the NAT and its security, which if people are not
    &gt; allowed to host servers (listening sockets) to the outside world (which a
    &gt; NAT usually prevents) will possibly get the person bypassing the security
    &gt; sacked (or if at an educational institution expelled), and also make the
    &gt; network admins start blocking jabber access. You cant expect all network
    &gt; admins to have forseen all possible sources of breaches (especially for
    &gt; protocols that are extremely new, i.e. DSPS), also in my experience network
    &gt; admins react to breaches and start blocking things, rather than pre-blocking
    &gt; potensial things, either because they havent got the time, dont know about
    &gt; the possible breaches or cant be bothered, not a good thing but is a fact of
    &gt; life.
    &gt;
    &gt; The whole point of this is that sure, they may not oridinarily be too
    &gt; worried about outgoing connections, but DSPS allows the creation of virtual
    &gt; incoming connections that would not ordinarily be possible.

    &gt; &gt; If they're worried about outgoing connections, they should setup a
    &gt; &gt; firewall that blocks them, too.  If their firewall allows outgoing
    &gt; &gt; connections without having to hack around something (or crack into
    &gt; &gt; something), they're allowing you to create outgoing connections as a
    &gt; &gt; matter of policy (since NAT and IPMasq both involve very _active_ roles
    &gt; &gt; that the firewall must play in order to _allow_ you to create outgoing
    &gt; &gt; connections - clearly, a company wouldn't be so foolish as to implement
    &gt; &gt; an added feature only to disallow its use).

    &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry to put a dampener on this it looks for for some uses (helping

    &gt; block
    &gt; &gt; &gt; all jabber connections if they find people using it to breach network

    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Often, the problem is not technical (a SOCKS server can't be setup
    &gt; because
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it'd compomise network security), but is rather administrative (a
    &gt; SOCKS
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; server can't be setup because there's too much beauracracy involved,
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plus the possibility that the network admin is too scared to poke
    &gt; holes
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in his firewall, not realizing that allowing outgoing connections is
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already poking a hole big enough for people to create virtual incoming
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connections).  Also, an old hardware-based firewall may not even
    &gt; support a
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SOCKS add-on.  Finally, there's no real reason for people to have to
    &gt; setup
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a rather complex piece of software on their firewalls just so they can
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transfer files in Jabber; let them use a server-based solution

    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The original intent of DSPS was to address the problems
    &gt; transferring
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; data to/from &quot;firewalled&quot; clients, without introducing new issues
    &gt; (as
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with PASS).
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The current spec talks solely about components, although a
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;stand-alone&quot;
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; server could be utilized.  Also, although it is not by design,
    &gt; this
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could handle direct connections, with one of the clients acting as
    &gt; a
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DSPS &quot;server&quot; (for connection-handling only; I know I wouldn't
    &gt; want
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone trying to tell my client to create a DSPS connection for
    &gt; them
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (-: ).  This (a client-side DSPS &quot;server&quot;) is something I've
    &gt; thought
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about just recently, while looking at how we can &quot;clean up&quot; the
    &gt; &gt; &gt; current
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specification.
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At its core, DSPS is fairly easy to support from a client (as
    &gt; others
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have stated).  Also, it's &quot;required&quot; functionality (which, I
    &gt; admit, is
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not clearly differentiated from &quot;optional&quot; functionality) is not
    &gt; all
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that difficult to implement, and (with modifications, or a new
    &gt; spec)
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be used in direct, P2P connections.
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I think a single &quot;standardized&quot; method of handling
    &gt; &quot;data
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connections&quot; needs to be defined for Jabber, whether it be via
    &gt; DSPS,
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PASS, or even modifications to the current OOB mechanism.
    &gt; Currently,
    &gt; &gt; &gt; I
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can see DSPS as becoming an adequate, maybe even preferred, method
    &gt; of
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing this.
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is my opinion, although your mileage (and opinions) may (most
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; likely) vary.

    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     I agree, that using a stream layer separate from the file

    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     be preferred, I just think we shouldn't rely on a server as a

    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     all situations. Working around firewall issues is a problem

    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     solved by nearly every peer-to-peer network in existence, so I
    &gt; &gt; &gt; assume
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     there has to be a solution that will work for Jabber. In fact,
    &gt; by
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keeping
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     the stream layer separate, it should be possible to initiate
    &gt; the
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connect
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     from either side and then do a data transfer in either
    &gt; direction.
    &gt; &gt; &gt; This
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     if I am behind a firewall, but the person I'm communicating
    &gt; with
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isn't, I
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     can open a connection to them and then push my data across.
    &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     DSPS spec should be expanded/altered to the point where it
    &gt; doesn't
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     necessarily imply that a proxy is necessary.
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Currently, the server doesn't have any knowledge of what a
    &gt; user's
    &gt; &gt; &gt; IP
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     beyond socket creation, and I would guess that this will stay
    &gt; this
    &gt; &gt; &gt; way
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     the open source implementation -- it is a privacy concern,
    &gt; after
    &gt; &gt; &gt; all.
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     being said, however, it would be pretty easy to write
    &gt; something
    &gt; &gt; &gt; that
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     have this information (a DSPS component?) available if it was

    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; SSL, reverse-connections, etc.  I completely agree with Rob

    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keeping the

    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">joe at blow.org</A>/Home?  Connect to this IP address.&quot;  This might
    &gt; be
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through DSPS,
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; or it might be direct, or whatever.  I'm just saying, we
    &gt; need a
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple way
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; for clients to ask for a stream.  DSPS seems to have a nice
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interface, but it
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; assumes we want to route through an external point.  Maybe
    &gt; the
    &gt; &gt; &gt; real
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; is to have an even smarter component that will hook you up
    &gt; &gt; &gt; directly
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; other person if possible, otherwise fall back to DSPS (all
    &gt; &gt; &gt; hiding
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this from
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; the client).
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; The current situation is not optimal.
