</I>I would vote for opt-out because they don't break any client and many 
clients can profit by it. It will work with TCP/IP over GPRS the same 
way as with TCP/IP over Ethernet, PPP, HDLC, Bluetooth or any other 
protocol beneath IP or IPv6.

If have enabled keep-alives at my server (amessage) ... just two lines 
of code that have to be added. I will now lower the keep-alive intervals 
bit by bit. I havn't had any problems yet.
There are three &quot;screws&quot; you can turn: The time of inactivity after that 
the keep-alive is send, the interval for resending keep-alives that 
havn't been acknowledged and the number of unsuccessful keep-alives that 
are treated as a broken connection.
