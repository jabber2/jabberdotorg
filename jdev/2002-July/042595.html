True, I never considered OOB data though..

&gt;&gt;<i>2. It is bound to TCP/IP, I could for example use a bluetooth link or a serial link

Well, it's a problem in manny connection oriented enviroment, not just TCP/IP.. if we 
start using keepalive will people say: we've got the solution now, so why bother on 
making something on the jabber protocol level (or support it)? 

&gt;&gt;<i>3. keep alive is OS dependant. Not all OSes provide acces to it, and some let you

</I>&gt;<i>On the one hand I know no operating system that doesn't support it, on

</I>
Hm, I suppose you're right here, there's not manny operating systems left that don't 
support it, and the ones I can think of you probably would not want to run a jabber 
server on anyway.

&gt;&gt;<i>4 I asume keep-alives will be for *all* user that log into jabber, some might not 
</I>want 
&gt;&gt;<i>keep-alives or anything like it at all for their clients.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As I told: It's completely transparent to the client. The only thing why 
</I>&gt;<i>he couldn't like it is that the client has very expensive metered 
</I>&gt;<i>traffic. For this clients would be possible to include some way to 
</I>&gt;<i>disable keep-alives (the server can activate and deactivate keep-alives 
</I>&gt;<i>per connection). 
</I>&gt;<i> But as I wrote above: It is a very small amount of 
</I>&gt;<i>additional traffic and it's only generated on idle connections. Every 
</I>&gt;<i>other way to fix our TCP problems will generate more traffic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>A few of these problems came up before on the mailinglist, and I haven't yet heard 
</I>a 
&gt;&gt;<i>solution for them. It might not hinder any implemention for this on *nix, but the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>problem will still remain for the platforms/implementations that can not use this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We have servers on Unix, Windows and Java. All of this three platforms 
</I>&gt;<i>support keep-alives (Java since version 1.3). The client side is 
</I>&gt;<i>supported by every platform/language that supports TCP/IP.
</I>
I suppose my worries were a bit overstated, keepalives sound like a good solution 
(should they be opt-in or opt-out?). I hope they won't screw up my GPRS links but I 
don't think so.. I doubt there that manny implementations of jabber over something 
else as TCP/IP anyway, we'll just have to cross that bridge when we get there..
