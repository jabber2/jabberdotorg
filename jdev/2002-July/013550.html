<PRE>(Cross-posting, cause I think it applies to both lists.)

I agree, that using a stream layer separate from the file transfer would
be preferred, I just think we shouldn't rely on a server as a passthru in
all situations. Working around firewall issues is a problem that has been
solved by nearly every peer-to-peer network in existence, so I assume
there has to be a solution that will work for Jabber. In fact, by keeping
the stream layer separate, it should be possible to initiate the connect
from either side and then do a data transfer in either direction. This way
if I am behind a firewall, but the person I'm communicating with isn't, I
can open a connection to them and then push my data across. Perhaps the
DSPS spec should be expanded/altered to the point where it doesn't
necessarily imply that a proxy is necessary.

Currently, the server doesn't have any knowledge of what a user's IP is
beyond socket creation, and I would guess that this will stay this way in
the open source implementation -- it is a privacy concern, after all. That
being said, however, it would be pretty easy to write something that would
have this information (a DSPS component?) available if it was necessary.

Does any of this make sense? I'm just trying to avoid designing/developing
something that will not be used, because servers probably won't want to
take the extra bandwidth hit just to provide their users with the ability
to do file transfers.
