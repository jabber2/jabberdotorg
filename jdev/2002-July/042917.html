&gt;<i>The few things that you have pulled out as stats are just... a few

</I>    
The three core stats are just that &quot;core&quot; stats. they were choosen as being the ones
that most people would/want need to do a quick check of their server/component. By limiting
the core stats to the three &lt;who/&gt;, &lt;uptime/&gt; and &lt;traffic/&gt; that MUST be supported by a server
/component we make complience and support of the namespace less of a burden.
    
&gt;<i>the namespace you are describing is very limiting for future growth.
</I>    
I'm not sure what you mean by being limited as the mechanism for extending the namespace
as a component sees fit is described even in the non updated draft.
    
&gt;<i>although I would change the implemenation to use iq:rpc.
</I>    
personally I would prefer iq:stats to remain a seperate namespace, however i have
not yet discussed that with my coauthors and they may have different views.
    
however thank you for your feedback and drafts are only that. 
Everything is changeable.
