<PRE>I am definitely authenticated and when I print out the packet that has
failed, I also print out the connectionstatus... it says it is connected.

Over the past few days I have found that there are some bits of code which,
if they are included, cause a failed packet to occur, even if they are not
actually reached during execution.... I have identified these lines of code
by commenting out a whole series and systematically testing the program by
uncommenting one line at a time.... this is how I have narrowed down the
fault to the rosterRefresh()... I thought I would retry it by creating an
individually tailored IQ packet but it seems to be the packet content, not
the way of creating it that is causing the problem here.

I also find that after one packet has failed, no more will go through.
