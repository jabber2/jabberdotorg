<PRE>Hi Matthias!

&gt;<i> (Sorry for not being famillar with Japanese names. What part of the name
</I>&gt;<i> should I use for English internet greetings?)
</I>
Hiroaki is my given name and Nakamura is my family name, So &quot;Hi Hiroaki!&quot;
is perfect. In Japanese, we write a family name followed by a given name.
In English, most people write a given name followed by a family name, but
some people write like &quot;NAKAMURA Hiroaki&quot; or &quot;Nakamura, Hiroaki&quot; .

</I>&gt;<i> Sure ... with proxy passthrough the server can push you new XML packets
</I>&gt;<i> when they are available. With JEP-0025 it has to wait for the client
</I>&gt;<i> polling the information. But it's a real problem that this method is not

</I>&gt;<i> Content-Length header with a POST or PUT request). E.g. it's not
</I>&gt;<i> possible to use this with out-of-the-box squish.
</I>
If you build the content as a string before sending, you can calculate
the content length and you can send a Content-Length header?
As for sending file, you can also precalculate the content length by
getting the file length.

I read JEP-0025 and understand the real problem is that proxies do
not allow HTTP Keep-alives. Am I correct?

&gt;<i> &gt;As for security problems, JEP-0025 with https would be no problem?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;1.client -&quot;connect jabber.org:443&quot;-&gt; HTTP proxy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;2.proxy --&gt; jabber.org:443
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;3.jabber.org:443 --&gt; jabber.org:5222 or jabber.org:5223
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this would be no problem. But I would layer it up the other way
</I>&gt;<i> round: Make your polls with http and use a jabber-ssl connection over
</I>&gt;<i> it. You don't have to reestablish the SSL context with every poll then.
</I>
Well, what you are saying is like below?
1.client --&quot;connect jabber.org:80&quot;_via_http--&gt; HTTP proxy
2.proxy --via_http--&gt; jabber.org:80
3.jabber.org:80 --via_https--&gt; jabber.org:5223
And in 1 and 2, contents are encrypted, and 3 is just forwarding.
Is this what you are saying?

&gt;<i> With the proxy-connect method you get a plain connection to the server
</I>&gt;<i> and don't need to modify the jabberd. The only problem with it is that
</I>&gt;<i> most proxies only accept connections to port 443 (this can be
</I>&gt;<i> configured, but in most of the cases you don't have control over the proxy).
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm doing at my Jabber server (<A HREF="http://amessage.info/">http://amessage.info/</A>) is to listen
</I>&gt;<i> on port 443 for incoming jabber connections (I'm just forwarding
</I>&gt;<i> connections to port 443 to port 5222). &quot;CONNECT amessage.info:443&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> should work with nearly any proxy installation that doesn't block &quot;https&quot;.
</I>
I now understand the most proxies only allows the port 443 as https.
In most cases, the port 443 is already used by a web server.
If it is Apache, then can I use mod_proxy to forward connections from
port 443?

As for the destination port, I think the forwarding is like
port 80  -&gt; port 5222
port 443 -&gt; port 5223
Am I wrong? Well, I am not sure about that.

(snip)
&gt;<i> The security problem of JEP-0025 could be fixed. I have written a
</I>&gt;<i> working extension of JEP-0025 with a protocol that was discussed in this
</I>&gt;<i> list some weeks ago. But I have never published this because I am not
</I>&gt;<i> sure if it is right to do that much work to bypass firewalls without
</I>&gt;<i> being allowed by the admins of these proxies.
</I>
Well, in the ideal world, each protocol is assigned to a port number.
But actually, there are already many protocols which does http tunneling.
So why not one more? :) Seriously I hope you publish your work.
Please publish it.

&gt;<i> &gt;PS. At Exodus sourceforge site, I have submitted two patches
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=587361&amp;group_id=2049&amp;atid=202049">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=587361&amp;group_id=2049&amp;atid=202049</A>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and one request.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> And what are they for?
</I>
I will write in another mail.
