But ...

Thomas Muldowney &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">temas at box5.net</A>&gt; had written:

</I>
That's what I was thinking of when I surmised that just sending
individual invisible's was the simplest solution.  What am I missing?

One thing which I don't understand regarding how the transports handle
this: why don't they just understand what the invisible bit means and
do the right thing?  I'm guessing that the answer is here:

Matthias Wimmer &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">m at tthias.net</A>&gt; had written:
:<i> The problem with it is, that the Jabber server doesn't send the 
</I>:<i> &lt;presence type='invisible'/&gt; packet to the transports. Invisibility and 
</I>:<i> transports only work if the Jabber client sends an addresses invisible 
</I>:<i> &lt;presence/&gt; to a transport.
</I>
And the alleged response to that, paraphrased, was &quot;server-side implied
logic suxx.&quot;

Eh?  Far be it from me to question the wisdom of people who've been
working on Jabber much longer than I, and presumably understand its
logic and where y'all are going with it much better than I, but this
quite frankly doesn't make sense to me.  I would *think* the purpose of
the transports is to &quot;protocol convert&quot; between Jabber and protocol X.
ISTM that would include such things as &quot;invisible.&quot;  Forcing each and
every client to individually deal with such things on a
protocol-by-protocol basis does not make sense to me.

Jim
