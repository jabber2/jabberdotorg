Nope, I didn't mean to use binary responses.  I meant to use the TCP
technique of piggybacking ACKs on other types of packets (e.g., messages)
to save packets.  For instance, rather than sending an immediate response
of &quot;&lt;message id=&quot;243&quot; type=&quot;delivered&quot;/&gt;&quot; after receiving &quot;&lt;message
to='<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">somebody at somewhere</A>' id='243'&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hi&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/message&gt;,&quot; the server
would send &quot;&lt;message from='<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">somebody at somewhere</A>' id='244'&gt;&lt;body&gt;What&amp;apos;s
up?&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/message&gt;&lt;message id='243' type='delivered'/&gt;&quot; all at once
when the next message came, rather than sending the ACK immediately.
I don't think we should use binary in an XML transport layer, and I
don't think that's about to change.  (As I've indicated in the past, I
believe very strongly that Jabber should support other transport layers,
but the last time I said anything about that, I got flamed to death,
so pretend I didn't just say that ... hehe. . .)
