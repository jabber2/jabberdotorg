<PRE>Please can someone help me - I am having problems using jabberbeans to confirm subscription requests....

it would really help me if someone could show me an example of a presence subscription in XML, from the side of the person being subscribed to.... see thread below.

Emma





OK - I know my Jabber protocols - I have spent the last 2 months learning them... however, non of the books or jabber.org or other sites explain the process of subscription as it appear on the side of the person being subscribed to - just on the side of the person subscribing.
  There should be examples there in the test directory.
  In order to recieve messages you have to have a packet listener listening for &quot;message&quot; type packets and you won't get messages until you send the server an available.  

  I have several packet listeners, all of which print out when they receive or send a message.  I am receiving a print out on the sender's side to say that their roster subsribe ask has succeeded; however, I was surprised that the person being subscribed to doesn't receive a packet saying that someone wants to subscribe to their presence - its just appears in their roster as an unconfirmed subscription.... HOW  DO I CONFIRM A SUBSCRIPTION?

  You never send roster subscription packets.  You just send the user a subscribe and if they approve it then you need to move them in to a specific group and give them a nickname with a roster change.

  I have sent them a subscribe - they have recieved it (ie it appears on their roster saying subscribe=&quot;&quot;) - how do they approve it using jabberbeans; also how do I detect that the subscription is received?

  Beyond this I'm going to say you need to learn the protocol documents.  If you learn the protocol then using jabberbeans is simple.  I just really don't have time to walk you through the library.  Between the protocol, the tests and the javadoc, you should have more than enough documentation to complete your project.

  I have read your javadocs inside out - they are v complicated compared to other javadocs I have read.  I know my jabber protocol and all except 2 of the tests won;t compile because they use deprecated parts of the jabberbeans.
