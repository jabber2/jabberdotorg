<PRE>  After banging my head against the wall reading a bunch of out-of-date
and incomplete Jabber documentation on shared groups (mod_groups), I
finally resorted to reading and hacking the mod_groups.c code a little.

  I wanted to have some shared groups for our company's employees.
Here's what I was after:

  1. I wanted them to be &lt;static/&gt;, so only the administrator (me)
     could define the members of the group.  Good so far.

  2. I wanted the groups to drop into an employee roster without much
     work.  I didn't want them to be &lt;require/&gt;'d.  Registering with
     im.example.com/groups/groupname did the trick.  Good so far.

  3. I wanted the presence of all employees to be automatically sent to
     anyone that had the group listed in their roster.

     That is, if you registered with im.example.com/groups/accounting,
     and Mary is a member of the accounting group, you should get Mary's
     presence in your roster without having to subscribe to Mary
     specifically.

  As I found out, mod_groups.c doesn't allow #3 for &lt;static/&gt; groups.
Why, I can't be sure.  I tracked down what I believe to be the line that
makes the determination between a &lt;static/&gt; group and a normal group.  I
commented out a single if statement so that it runs the
presence-broadcasting code for all groups.

  Comments?  I want to make sure I've modified the correct line, and that
it won't have any unintended side-effects...
