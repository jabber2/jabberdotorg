<PRE>Why not just get people to use SOCKS5 ?? or similar instead of trying to
reinvent the wheel as it were. If on a corporate LAN and there is a firewall
with no SOCKS server then people probably shouldnt really be trying to
bypass the company firewall anyway. If not then they need to pester the
network manager to set up a SOCKS server to service the jabber clients.

&gt;<i> The original intent of DSPS was to address the problems transferring
</I>&gt;<i> data to/from &quot;firewalled&quot; clients, without introducing new issues (as
</I>&gt;<i> with PASS).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current spec talks solely about components, although a &quot;stand-alone&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> server could be utilized.  Also, although it is not by design, this
</I>&gt;<i> could handle direct connections, with one of the clients acting as a
</I>&gt;<i> DSPS &quot;server&quot; (for connection-handling only; I know I wouldn't want
</I>&gt;<i> someone trying to tell my client to create a DSPS connection for them
</I>&gt;<i> (-: ).  This (a client-side DSPS &quot;server&quot;) is something I've thought
</I>&gt;<i> about just recently, while looking at how we can &quot;clean up&quot; the current
</I>&gt;<i> specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At its core, DSPS is fairly easy to support from a client (as others
</I>&gt;<i> have stated).  Also, it's &quot;required&quot; functionality (which, I admit, is
</I>&gt;<i> not clearly differentiated from &quot;optional&quot; functionality) is not all
</I>&gt;<i> that difficult to implement, and (with modifications, or a new spec)
</I>&gt;<i> could be used in direct, P2P connections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I think a single &quot;standardized&quot; method of handling &quot;data
</I>&gt;<i> connections&quot; needs to be defined for Jabber, whether it be via DSPS,
</I>&gt;<i> PASS, or even modifications to the current OOB mechanism.  Currently, I
</I>&gt;<i> can see DSPS as becoming an adequate, maybe even preferred, method of
</I>&gt;<i> doing this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is my opinion, although your mileage (and opinions) may (most
</I>&gt;<i> likely) vary.

</I>the
&gt;<i>     DSPS spec should be expanded/altered to the point where it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>     necessarily imply that a proxy is necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Currently, the server doesn't have any knowledge of what a user's IP
</I>is
&gt;<i>     beyond socket creation, and I would guess that this will stay this way
</I>in
&gt;<i>     the open source implementation -- it is a privacy concern, after all.
</I>That
&gt;<i>     being said, however, it would be pretty easy to write something that
</I>would
&gt;<i>     have this information (a DSPS component?) available if it was
</I>necessary.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Does any of this make sense? I'm just trying to avoid
</I>designing/developing
&gt;<i>     something that will not be used, because servers probably won't want

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; DSPS is dead-easy to use from a client perspective.  What we need is

&gt;<i>     &gt; similar to it, as a standard part of jabberd, that allows clients to
</I>ask for
&gt;<i>     &gt; a stream to another JID.  Something very simple like:  &quot;Oh, you want
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">joe at blow.org</A>/Home?  Connect to this IP address.&quot;  This might be
</I>through DSPS,
&gt;<i>     &gt; or it might be direct, or whatever.  I'm just saying, we need a
</I>simple way
&gt;<i>     &gt; for clients to ask for a stream.  DSPS seems to have a nice
</I>interface, but it
&gt;<i>     &gt; assumes we want to route through an external point.  Maybe the real
</I>solution
&gt;<i>     &gt; is to have an even smarter component that will hook you up directly
</I>to the
&gt;<i>     &gt; other person if possible, otherwise fall back to DSPS (all hiding
</I>this from
&gt;<i>     &gt; the client).
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; The current situation is not optimal.
