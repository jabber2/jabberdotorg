Not really, as far as I understand XMPP is generally associated with
the exchange of vastly many XML elements within a single document. Now
I know that the VTD docs say that the XML document is updatable, but
as far as XMPP is concerned, once a node is parsed and processed, you
can forget about it's data entirely.  It seems that VTD is a 'bounded'
solution, i.e. there's no scope for throwing data away once it has
been processed.  I'm not sure if XMPP streams on busy servers could
reach the 30bit/1gb limit imposed by the VTD format, but it seems that
VTD is better oriented to parsing disk based files, rather than
streams.

I applaud you on promoting the parser, too many xmpp projects go and
re-write an XML parser.  I guess this has mostly been because of lack
of decent XML parsers being available at the time of writing, but even
projects like agsXMPP and XMPP.NET do it  (just to name two examples).
 I'm also not sure to what degree XMPP has glitches that
'framework/off-the-shelf' XML parsers can't handle, and therefore some
projects probably end up fairly far down the road with a standard
parser, before having to backtrack, and implement their own parser to
work around some tiny niggly bug.
