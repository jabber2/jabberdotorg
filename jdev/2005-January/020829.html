<PRE>Thanks for your reply. 
        
       I had assumed that everyone had found a simple way around flashes
sandbox by embedding flash inside shockwave which it then went on to make a
socket connection to jabber.org. Now I believe I could have been the only
one. When it first worked I watched it read the crossdomain.xml file once
and that was that. I assumed it was a function of director and flash. Can
anyone make comments if this is true? Did shockwave just receive a patch? 

Should Flash Player Settings say: Allow jabber.org to access your Local
storage Right now it says whatever my server name is in both cases. 
Is there anyway I could change that?

Anyone from jabber.org

Was jabber.org upgraded or changed one - two nights ago because I could not
log in with my exodus client and today my flash web client stopped working.
So I was wondering if my account was flagged or was the server altered in
someway which would prevent web connections or did I do something. It was
working fine. I wish I took some screenshots.
