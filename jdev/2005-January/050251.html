<PRE>I've been working with Jabber.com's XCP (for 2.5 years).  We have a
large ISP application, and we required that it scale to the hundreds of
thousands.  They pitched their XCP 4.1, and it looks pretty good --
we're upgrading.

We've been using a much older version, and have been happy with the
stability.  Since then they've worked on making it Data Center quality
(logging, reliability, redundancy, scalability, Web Admin, even
_documentation_!!)  We did a survey of the other commercial products,
and this one definitely was all there.  

We kicked the tires in our lab with 2 commercial products in an 8
machine, 100k concurrent user capacity cluster with 2 active XMPP
Routers.  We had 2 routers, 4 front-end machines. And we ran a half-day
load test.

We liked Jabber.com.  They definitely have a plan for scalabilty that
works in Active/Active mode that I believe will scale to millions of
users.  However, I still think they could have a better failover plan.

If you're serious about million user capacity, I really think you need
to go commercial.  Of course you'd also need to get off of Linux and go
to Solaris too.  Get yourself some big Sun servers with lots of
processors.  Get Oracle.  Put it all in a data center with raised floors
and 24x7 admins and pay union guys to run your cables.  Come play with
the big boys!

&gt;<i> If it is not important to have the same domain name for the one 
</I>&gt;<i> million users then the solution is trivial - just deploy f.e.100 
</I>&gt;<i> servers with 10000 users on each. :)
</I>
You dont have to have them on different domain names to be able to have
100 servers, you just use a jabber server with a distributed
architecture, which is where the commercial jabber server solutions come
in.

&gt;<i> This solution brings an additional benefit - failure proof. Small 
</I>&gt;<i> server can be much easily replaced than big one.
</I>
The solution of 100 servers each serving its own different domain is not
failure proof at all (if one server goes down none if its users will be
able to login), its only failure proof if any user can login to any of
the servers with a single set of credentials, which is something only a
distributed load balanced jabber server can provide.
