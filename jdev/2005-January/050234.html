<PRE>hello  all / carsten,
regarding  this  post
and  had  some  questions  and  thoughts,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Between two endpoints there are many things like firewalls, routers 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the like, this leads to the only solution: a relay or a server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Which of course has some obvious drawbacks. First thing is that 
</I>&gt;<i> someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs to provide a server (for free) and a _lot_ of bandwidth,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially if you're going to do video.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is true, but my point is more that the software, the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> and the servers should be open source.
</I>
FULL ACK

&gt;<i>  If you are not happy with a
</I>&gt;<i> server, you are able to create your own. Richard Stallman say's long 
</I>&gt;<i> ago
</I>&gt;<i> that freedom means that you must have the right to copy, share and
</I>&gt;<i> modify the sources. If you want you CAN run your own server perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> for your family. I feel that this is a bigger issue then ever, with
</I>&gt;<i> software patents at the door of europe and globaly controled standards.
</I>&gt;<i> As you know, one of the reason to doing this is that M$ doens't support
</I>&gt;<i> Win98 anymore.
</I>
I  try  to  find  the  cources  of  an  old  protocol  called  cuseeme
and  i  like  to  hear  if  some  body  else  is  interesed  in  
working  on this.

Carsten is  with  www.carminotalks.org  on the  way  to  create a  
multiconferencing  client  as  i  can  see  but  there  is  no  code
and  not  develeopment  in the  last  half  year.
I  am  in  contact  to  a  few  develoepers  and  like
to  bring  www.cuseeme.de back  to the  community.
My  question  is  IF  somebody  know  anyone  , that  probably  know
a  friend  that had  the  &quot;old  cornell client  sources &quot;
plese  drop  me  a  line.
&gt;<i> &gt; Other problem is logistics. If I'm talking to my girlfriend (who 
</I>&gt;<i> lives
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the same city) then it's kind of wastefull if that connection goes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through some server in the US. This will also add at least 100ms of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; latency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's note Realy a issue. If i be as good as Netmeeting, im happy
</I>&gt;<i> with that. Videoconferencing is nothing really new.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So yes, from a technical point of view using a relay/server is the 
</I>&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to go, it solves quite a bit of firewall/routing problems. But from 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user point of view using intermediate servers just sucks :D 
</I>&gt;<i> Especially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if those servers go down or can't handle the load.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> But i dont see another way to allow connections with more the two 
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Same thing goed for filetransfer BTW.
