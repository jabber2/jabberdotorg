The existing bot describes the current weather.  I wanted to do forecasts as 
well, as I've already mentioned.  But forecasts and current data are 
different creatures, and using XML like they have, not grouping the relevant 
data together, makes for difficult usage.  I would prefer to go to an element 
which has all the data for a single date and time, than go hunting around the 
document to pick up bits and pieces from all over the place, as they would 
have you do.

But what is your objection to using other means for getting data for other
days? Why can't three different forecasts be three different pubsub items? 
Or shall we just throw that feature of pubsub out of the window and go for
single, gigantic documents for everything in Jabber which uses pubsub?

</I>
I only care about file size because I don't want to spam a whole week of
weather data down an IM channel every half an hour to a hundred or more users.  
It should be more than sufficient to require people to (a) remember the 
previous data, or (b) make subsequent requests for the older data.

&gt;<i> The claims were that this file was filled with rubbish and not human

</I>&gt;<i> could read it and understand it in 1 go without any documentation

</I>&gt;<i> few things you don't *understand* in there, doesn't mean they are useless

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While we're at it, the way they use it much MORE human readable than what

</I>
Perhaps you missed the part of my email where I mentioned _standardising_ the
units.  Make it whatever unit the majority of people will use (in this
case, Celsius) and everyone else can translate it to whatever they want.

&gt;<i> It's like I would give you a free dinner, and you'd complain that
</I>&gt;<i> there's carrots on the menu (you don't even LIKE carrots)
</I>
The funny thing is... I probably would complain in that situation.

But it's not like those guys are the only ones giving away a free meal.  
Weather.com give their data out in XML format, and their data is more 
comprehensive, at least geographically.  There are two other XML formats for 
weather which I've found so far, and of the four, Weather.com's is easiest to 
understand.  Unfortunately it's not open. :-/

&gt;<i> &gt; P.S. You don't need to send a copy to me and the list.  I don't need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receive the email twice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, then you shouldn't have added a reply-to: header with your address
</I>&gt;<i> in it to your email. In case you don't know that means &quot;send a reply to
</I>&gt;<i> this address&quot;.
</I>
It's still considered bad form to send doubles in the case of mailing
lists. I'm on the mailing list, sending a separate copy to me isn't helping
anything... come to think of it, it's odd that the mailing list isn't 
overwriting the header to make replies go back to the list.
