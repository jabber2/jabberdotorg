Ok, there seems to be a misunderstanding here. I'm not suggesting you use  
this format to send over jabber, let alone all of it in one go. As a  
source of weather data I think the xml format we're discussing is good,  
it's certainly human readable. As I said, extracting the relevant data and  
sending it to the user (in whatever format you choose, this one or  
another) is your job.

So I of course have nothing against using different pub sub nodes for  
different days, predictions whatever. There's no need to pump this entire  
XML file straight onto Jabber.

Though I wasn't suggesting you should use it for your service, using the  
format for sending weather data over Jabber isn't bad either. It all  
depends on how fine grained you want your service to be. If it's all very  
simple, and you know it'll stay that way it's probably overkill to use  
this. You should go with whatever you think is best (you've obviously done  
more research than I, and you know what you're building).

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, then you shouldn't have added a reply-to: header with your address

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
It's considered polite to send replies to all reply-to addresses. To keep  
it on topic, if I was using a Jabber client to read this list through my  
email gateway, according to JEP-0033 (the mapping of these type of headers  
to jabber) I would be *breaking protocol* if I didn't. (section 4.6.4)

It's considered bad to set a reply-to: header when you don't want replies.  
There are valid reasons to request an offlist copy of any replies to your  
messages (for example if you subribe to a daily or weekly digest). Which  
is why the mailing list does not overwrite it I assume.
