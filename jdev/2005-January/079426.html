<PRE>Thanks for reply again. 

When it was working, I did see it say &quot;reading crossdomain.xml&quot; 

Now it just says 

&quot;Connecting to jabber.org...&quot;

Did you ever have a severed flash client connect to jabber.org before and
now it also has stopped connecting?  

To conclude: The crossdomain policy file is not accessible on Jabber.org
because the <A HREF="http://jabber.org/crossdomain.xml">http://jabber.org/crossdomain.xml</A> isn't resolving.  

Is there any action scripting I can do help the socket connection along via
undocumented stuff or otherwise? 

Thanks 

Should I assume that someone at Jabber.org will resolve this issue? 

Thanks again -Dan

Thanks for your reply. 

&gt;&gt;<i>I guess you tried to connect to Jabber.org with a SWF on a server and it
</I>Failed to connect? 

__
Yes, I'd attempted to connect to jabber.org from a SWF within a page served
by my own server and received a connection error.

&gt;&gt;<i>Can Jabber.org tell which kind of clients are connected at any one time?
</I>Can you tell if they are Director, Shockwave, flash or java, c++ or
whatever?  
__

Flash connections utilize the flash:stream element to signal their handling
requirements, but standard socket connections are handled uniformly. IIRC
the reason that flash connections are exceptional is that they're not
sending valid xml fragmenents.


&gt;&gt;<i> I had it working, but something changed. Either my code or jabber or
</I>something in between. 

I'd look into the fact that <A HREF="http://jabber.org/crossdomain.xml">http://jabber.org/crossdomain.xml</A> isn't
resolving, this is likely where the Flash Player is looking for the policy
file - you're attempting to connect to jabber.org:5222, so it checks the
root directory at <A HREF="http://jabber.org.">http://jabber.org.</A>

 <A HREF="http://jabber.org/crossdomain.xml">http://jabber.org/crossdomain.xml</A> isn't resolving for me - this could be
the problem.

Also, I've tested the current flash player version under this scenerio and
can confirm that you can connect to remote domains from a served SWF if the
crossdomain policy file is accessible.

Here's the policy file I'd tested against

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd&quot;">http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd&quot;</A>&gt;
&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;
   &lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;*&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;
