<PRE>&gt;<i> I've implemented a jabber client that uses jabberd2 open source server and 
</I>&gt;<i> we are going to need it to scale to well above the 1 million concurrent 
</I>&gt;<i> users mark.
</I>
You wont be able to with jabberd2, its not intended to be used to that sort 
of scale, you will need to pay money out and get a commercial solution.

&gt;<i> Right now we have moved all jabber services to its own box, but once this 
</I>&gt;<i> software goes open beta (gopetslive.com), we are going to need to scale 
</I>&gt;<i> up.
</I>
You will need an architechture that distributes components of the server 
over multiple physical servers.

&gt;<i> I'm just curious from developers as well, as where energy needs to be put 
</I>&gt;<i> in the open source tools that can benefit the community for making jabber 
</I>&gt;<i> an enterprise and greater scalable solution.
</I>
The scalability is not a problem with jabber itself, its a problem with the 
particular implementation you are trying to use, as has been said if you 
want real scalability you will have to pay for a commercial solution as I 
doubt high level scalability (what you seem to want) will be much of a 
priority for the developers of the jabberd2 project in the short and medium 
terms, their focus will be to make it feature complete and stable, as has 
been said high level scalability is a big business itch not an itch the 
smaller scale developers of the jabberd2 project have or need to scratch at 
the moment, they have far more important tasks to focus on.
