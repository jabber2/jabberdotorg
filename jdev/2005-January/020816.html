I think the problem here could be resource management on servers not 
clients waiting for the next few bytes. I say could be because I have no 
data and it might be a non-problem, but instinctively the ideal of 
holding XML parse streams open like this has my back up - framed octet 
streams, sure; XML events, hmm.

You still have to manage the buffer/frame coming off the socket while 
building the DOM tree. The natural solutions seems to be to layer a 
framing mechanism on top of SAX to manage the network i/o possibly 
exposing a pull style API. SAX may look like a streaming API but it is 
really designed for conserving memory footprint while crunching through 
documents that are &quot;to hand&quot; locally. It's not designed for network data 
streams. I imagine life would be simpler for your fragment approach if 
you were not modeling the entire message stream as a single XML document 
and were working with discrete XML documents instead of child nodes. I 
definitely would not want to be holding onto full DOM trees or some such 
while managing thousands of IM conversations.
