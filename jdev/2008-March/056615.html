Sure, as long as you stay within your roster, all is well. This is why
PEP is very well suited for PubSub. However, my argument was that some
people believe RSS feeds should be removed completely in favor of a
PubSub system, and this goes well outside your roster. And once it
goes outside of my roster of trusted contacts, that's where I would
stop using a push system for notifications.

And yes, SPIM will always exist, and your JID will always leak.
However, as with e-mail, the more your address becomes visible, the
more spam you get (and no, it's not just a fraction more, it's
significantly more). It always pays off to keep your jid private as
much as possible, no matter how much you are spammed already. But this
is getting off-topic.
