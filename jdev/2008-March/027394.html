<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Greg Wilson &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">gvwilson at cs.utoronto.ca</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Two grad students at U of Toronto have been working this term on a tool to 
</I>&gt;<i> analyze chat conversations (IRC, IM, etc.) and cluster messages into 
</I>&gt;<i> threads...
</I>&gt;<i> Would this make a good project for XMPP SoC?
</I>
&gt;<i> From: &quot;jehan&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jehan at zemarmot.net</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> for info, what do you mean by &quot;analyse chat conversations&quot;? Statistics 
</I>&gt;<i> analysis? Or intelligent analysis of the content (so an AI project)?
</I>
&quot;Analyze&quot; == &quot;run clustering algorithms to group individual messages
according to how related they are to each other so as to reconstruct
the logical threads of the conversation&quot;.  The clustering algorithms
themselves are statistical.  Their work does *not* include summarization
of the contents of the recovered threads, but that would be an obvious
next step.

&gt;<i> From: &quot;Kevin Smith&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">kevin at kismith.co.uk</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Could you send me a copy of the journal/conference paper please? I'd
</I>&gt;<i> be interested in reading about it, at least.
</I>
Nothing published yet --- this was a course project.  They will have a
screencast up on the web in a couple of weeks showing what their software
can do.  If you want, I can send references to the papers they've been
drawing on.

&gt;<i> From: &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">nicolas.verite at gmail.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Check out with the mouse pointer: <A HREF="http://linuxfr.org/board/">http://linuxfr.org/board/</A>
</I>
Times out on me.

&gt;<i> An user using the web-based interface clicks on this timestamp
</I>&gt;<i> in order to answer or reply to a line of chat.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus by hovering all the referenced timestamp,
</I>&gt;<i> one could easily read, follow, and instant view of mixed chat threads.
</I>
Interesting; Tong and Yaroslav's system doesn't require any extra
effort on the part of users, or use of new clients.  I'll point them
at it.

Thanks,
Greg
