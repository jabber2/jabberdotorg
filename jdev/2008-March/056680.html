<PRE>jehan a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> for info, what do you mean by &quot;analyse chat conversations&quot;? Statistics 
</I>&gt;<i> analysis? Or intelligent analysis of the content (so an AI project)?
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, about IM logs, I often thought that it would be nice to be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to store your chat history on servers. Indeed I often want to 
</I>&gt;<i> retrieve some conversation but I am not always on the same place, the 
</I>&gt;<i> same computer or simply I use different clients for tests (so even on 
</I>&gt;<i> the same computer I get lost to &quot;where&quot; is this interesting discussion I 
</I>&gt;<i> had with someone). Sometimes also I have to use clients with no log 
</I>&gt;<i> support, or I don't want to store them locally though I don't want them 
</I>&gt;<i> lost.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, it would be to XMPP what IMAP is to the emails and enable to 
</I>&gt;<i> separate the content (chat history) from the reader (Jabber client), 
</I>&gt;<i> though they will still have to process the data for displaying, search, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc. What do you think of this?

You're not the only one :) And a XEP exists:
