The point wasn't that python is useless. The point was why start writing
new server, when there are few fast &amp; good ones already, when you can
not possibly beat them in performance (and with XMPP server you need
performance, python is weak at that point). You could beat it with
functionality (on the long run, at last), but no bigger server would use
it anyway.

And people writing XMPP servers need to be really good programmers. So
faster learning is not a thing you would really need here, good
programmers do not (much) care, which language they use. Someone who can
not handle perl or erlang should keep away from tasks like XMPP servers,
kernels, GUI libraries&#8230;
