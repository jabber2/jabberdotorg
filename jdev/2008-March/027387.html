<PRE>Hello, 

for info, what do you mean by &quot;analyse chat conversations&quot;? Statistics 
analysis? Or intelligent analysis of the content (so an AI project)? 

By the way, about IM logs, I often thought that it would be nice to be able 
to store your chat history on servers. Indeed I often want to retrieve some 
conversation but I am not always on the same place, the same computer or 
simply I use different clients for tests (so even on the same computer I get 
lost to &quot;where&quot; is this interesting discussion I had with someone). 
Sometimes also I have to use clients with no log support, or I don't want to 
store them locally though I don't want them lost. 

In fact, it would be to XMPP what IMAP is to the emails and enable to 
separate the content (chat history) from the reader (Jabber client), though 
they will still have to process the data for displaying, search, etc. What 
do you think of this?
