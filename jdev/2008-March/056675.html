<PRE>Two grad students at U of Toronto have been working this term on a tool to 
analyze chat conversations (IRC, IM, etc.) and cluster messages into 
threads.  They presented their work this afternoon, and will be doing 
another presentation on April 9; I think it has promise, especially since 
they're using incremental algorithms that would be well-suited to 
real-time execution.  They're not going to carry on with it (they have 
thesis topics picked out, and this ain't it :-), but the long-term goal 
would be to build something that could plug into various clients, or be 
used to process logs.

Would this make a good project for XMPP SoC?  It would require a student 
who already has some understanding of IR, clustering algorithms, and NLP, 
but it could help make large chat spaces more usable.  I'd be willing to 
mentor...

Thanks,
Greg Wilson
