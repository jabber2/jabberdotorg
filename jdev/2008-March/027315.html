<PRE>&gt;<i> GMail is an example of 2 different applications clearly separated into
</I>&gt;<i> one user interface, and integrating on some fronts. I don't have a
</I>&gt;<i> problem with that. My problem is if you start creating one giant
</I>&gt;<i> client that does everything, where you soon end up with a user
</I>&gt;<i> interface that is only mediocre at all tasks, and very confusing. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I don't really agree. That's not like a program which does all and nothing, 
with too different tasks. As I said, for me they are related features and 
this can be done with a very simplistic and intuitive interface.
Of course, after this you have better developpers, better designers, and so 
better programs than other. 

I just spoke of gmail because this has some reputation currently and this 
enables to do many things which are very close to what could be done with 
Jabber, with the advantage that it is XMPP, so a decentralized network where 
you would choose your provider, though sharing some common clients (light 
web clients or heavy local ones). 

&gt;<i> An IM client wouldn't publish the capability of reading feeds, and as
</I>&gt;<i> such would not get notifications. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ok for this, but currently do clients tell what are their features? I 
thought it was only the server which does it. And so the idea would be that 
when a client connects, it tells to the server &quot;I can do this and this&quot;, 
hence a pubsub message would stay on the server as long as no client 
connects and tells it has this capacity? This is interesting. 

&gt;<i> I don't think anyone is doubting that XMPP is more than an IM
</I>&gt;<i> protocol. The question is whether you should build an XMPP client that
</I>&gt;<i> implements *everything* you can do with XMPP. My opinion is that this
</I>&gt;<i> leads to bad, uninspired applications. The best applications are
</I>&gt;<i> focused on their task, and do it extremely well. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I already gave my opinion above about this. I would just like to add 
thoughts in order to give weight to what Pedro Melo and Fabio Forno already 
said. XMPP has a specificity compared to what you suggest: it is a push 
system! This is something which gives the pubsub system for notification 
(for blog, website news, and so on) several very great advantages:
 - realtime
 - fabulous gain of bandwith: no need for a feed program anymore which 
connects to your website several times a day. Here it is replaced by a 
single connection by the website itself which will feed the node. And then 
it is up to the XMPP server to dispatch the notification to all subscribers. 
I remember some small blog which had to stop their RSS feeds because they 
had a small personnal server which had been completely loaded up by people's 
agregators trying to load news every 10 minutes. This could not happen with 
xmpp pubsub. 

This cannot be compared to current feed system because this work very 
differently. This is not something you check regularly. This is just a 
system where you are simply connected on the net without thinking of this 
and then you get notified about things you like and you wanted to be 
notified! The difference is that you don't need to take care anymore of 
this. You don't have to run specifically a program for following news: they 
come to you. For me this is another way of doing. 

For my own I use a little feeds, but I don't like it so much. I don't like 
to go and check my feed program.
Moreover even for IM features, I am not really fond of the current systems 
of a IM dedicated program with this list window which stays always opened. I 
think Jabber client can be so much more, and this passes through the step 
&quot;more integrated&quot;. 

After this, let's imagine many other advantages. You could imagine that at 
the opposite, you can publish from your Jabber client on your blog, by 
simply publishing to the node with a publisher login (and this would push on 
your blog bot which is a Jabber client).
And pubsub is not only notification. With this, you can imagine an 
implementation of &quot;Jabber mailing list&quot; where every subscriber has also the 
right to publish. So you just publish on the node and everyone receives 
(this is not like a muc chatroom, because you don't have the presence).
And for all this, I don't want to have 10 different programs, because for me 
it is the same thing: sending and receiving messages which matters (I 
subscribed to them). 

Your turn to speak. ;-)
