</I>PSYC is out of scope of &quot;IRC-to-MUC component&quot; project. The idea behind 
the project, as i understand it, is that xmpp protocol is superior to 
IRC, and that it would be good to have a bridge back to IRC from xmpp 
server (from MUC room exactly) for backward compatibility. And it is 
proposed to do so by making a component for xmpp server. &quot;Component&quot; 
means that this project is generally simpler/smaller than the whole 
server. And that project is especially made to work with xmpp server and 
do the bridging, nothing more. Morphing psyced into an xmpp componen 
would go as a downgrading, and that's not something you have in mind, i 
hope. While having a 'normal' (compiled with only IRC and Jabber 
support) psyced (with patches to enchant IRC-to-MUC compatibility and 
adaptations for different daemons) working as an xmpp server component 
is something i didn't had in mind when i planned to work on this project 
(i'm not saying it is completely unacceptable, but it sounds odd to me).

P.S. psyced is written in LPC.
