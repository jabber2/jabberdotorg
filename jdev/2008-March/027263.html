I am looking to fill the following position with YellowJacket Energy.
Any help would be most appreciated.

 

Sr. Software Engineer for Innovator in Energy Trading Solutions

applications. If you are excited about technology and interested in

YellowJacket. Working alongside some of the best technologists in the

technology that delivers results...what more could you ask for?

party IM providers. Reporting to the Director of Operations, you will
use your knowledge of messaging technologies such as SonicMQ, XMPP,
OpenFire, Jabber, AOL and OSCAR In this unique role, your ability to
work with a team is equally important as your own personal motivation
and work ethic. You will work with a variety of people inside and
outside of our organization and your knowledge of IM and Networking
Protocols will give you the insight needed to gain respect and establish
yourself as leader in this fast-paced industry. Your exceptional
Java/J2EE programming skills will be critical to your success, and
