Cool. Let us know when it's available so we can test it out.

&gt;<i> But the only remaining (but BIG) issue is that... I just discovered that
</I>&gt;<i> no client has a real support for pubsub nodes (at least, nor Gajim or
</I>&gt;<i> Psi, the most advanced Jabber client I think)!!! With Psi, you can

</I>&gt;<i> Moreover I could see in the xml console of both client that they well

</I>&gt;<i> in the roster, nor any message appearing. That's why I was on the Gajim
</I>&gt;<i> conference room, to ask for details of their implementation. :-/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I will try to add such support on Gajim or Psi?.. Because I am sad
</I>&gt;<i> that my plugin is useless! :p
</I>
What versions of Gajim and Psi are you using?

&gt;<i> So see you!
</I>&gt;<i> And sorry again for removing a gsoc project (unless you want to have 2
</I>&gt;<i> same plugins, but the mine will be good, I assure you! :p).
</I>
Heh. Well, there's no harm in two implementations, but I agree that it
does make sense not to duplicate efforts unless needed.
