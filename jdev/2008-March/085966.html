Well, there's XEP-0136, which does this within XMPP.

There's also been discussion of handling &quot;advanced&quot; archival and  
search by sticking the conversations into an IMAP store, since  
searching and managing is something that IMAP does pretty well. (And  
it'll improve without us having to do anything particularly special).

My apologies for changing the subject line to something relevant.

Dave.
