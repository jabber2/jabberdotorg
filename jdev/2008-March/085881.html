<PRE>Hello,

for further details, I tried it out with the last svn versions of Psi 
and Gajim.

The last psi version does not change anything. I can see the 
notification arriving to the client when I open the xml console, but 
nothing happens in the interface. No moving icon, no popping-up 
message... Apparently Psi does not know what to do when he receives the 
message from the pubsub node.

In last svn version of gajim though, there is improvement. When I 
receive the pubsub message, there is a small pop-up, but it shows only 
the title.

I will make further tests and investigations. Maybe something could be 
done because pubsub is a nice feature, but it is extremely flawed in all 
implementations (even gajim).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe I will try to add such support on Gajim or Psi?.. Because I am sad

</I>&gt;<i> What versions of Gajim and Psi are you using?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So see you!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And sorry again for removing a gsoc project (unless you want to have 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same plugins, but the mine will be good, I assure you! :p).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Heh. Well, there's no harm in two implementations, but I agree that it
</I>&gt;<i> does make sense not to duplicate efforts unless needed.
