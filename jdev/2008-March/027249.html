</I>&gt;<i> I proposed this idea and this kind of gateway because it won't harm
</I>&gt;<i> IRC users and will enable jabber users to connect to a certain
</I>&gt;<i> network. The operators of some IRC network would just have to allow
</I>&gt;<i> this new transport to connect to their other servers via IRC S2S
</I>&gt;<i> protocol and that's it. Though of course there is still the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility that the IRC people with their little egos won't like
</I>&gt;<i> that. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tobias
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>I spoke with Carlo v. Loesch. Well, what can i say...They got 
semi-working (private messages, untested/partial support for channels 
and presence) IRC-XMPP gateway. Problem is, they are making psyc, some 
kind of merged conference technology...As far as i understand, psycd is 
a psyc (*silly cow*!) daemon for inter-protocol gating, including XMPP 
to IRC. Good thing is that i won't need to do it from scratch (actually 
it's kinda bad, since this way i am missing all the *fun* of hacking 
into xmpp/irc protocols). Bad thing is that i'll have to read psycd code 
(which isn't *smooth*), and i'll have to separate XMPP-IRC code from the 
rest of the psycd.

P.S. Been reading about zeroconf. Howl (from Porchdog) looks nice. 
Thinking...
