</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Instead of creating (yet another) full XMPP server, how about creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like a standalone MUC component. This requires implementing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a part of an XMPP server, but certainly not everything from core and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IM. I have had a situation where I would have really liked to set up a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MUC conference server without running the full blown server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or maybe, to have something more general, something that can take any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; component (like a transport, ...), and serve it standalone. I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; given this much thought whether this technically makes sense or  is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible at all, but from a user's perspective I think it would (cfr
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the MUC case).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I can certainly see where you coming from but you may not be able to do
</I>&gt;<i> just that without implementing most of RFC 3920 and part of 3921. That
</I>&gt;<i> being said, if your application reisde in a closed environment you could
</I>&gt;<i> consider dropping part of what would be useless to you. That wouldn't work
</I>&gt;<i> well if you were to open your XMPP network to external nodes which may
</I>&gt;<i> require more of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or you could just use ejabberd :)
