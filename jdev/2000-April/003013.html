    A better solution might be to (optionally) make the client do some
hard work that the server can check easily, such as factoring a large
number chosen by the server:

    C:  &lt;jabber-request&gt;[content]&lt;/jabber-request&gt;
    S:  &lt;jabber-response please-factor=&quot;21&quot;/&gt;
    C:  &lt;jabber-request please-factor=&quot;21&quot; factor_a=&quot;3&quot; factor_b=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
        [content]&lt;/jabber-request&gt;

    Of course, substitute a suitable bignum in place of `21'.

    Added work on the server side:  generating bignums (and their
factorizations), managing a pool of same, checking factor_a and factor_b
on every request, making sure the challenge is currently in the pool,
issuing new challenges for failed responses.

    Added work on the client side:  keeping the most recent request in a
buffer in case it is challenged, factoring bignums, resending requests
that have been challenged.

    Very minimal bignum support (integer multiplication only) is required
on client and server; one doesn't require a full-featured implementation
like libgmp.

    The advantages are that, under high load, throttling is handled by the
client, instead of the server keeping per-client state; and throttling can
be per-client (privileged clients are offered non-expiring challenges, but
everybody else has to periodically respond to a new challenge; and/or
second-tier clients are given bigger nums to factor).

    Thoughts?  I wouldn't be averse to coding this up myself.  I'm going
to be dealing with serious Jabber scaling issues soon . . . .
