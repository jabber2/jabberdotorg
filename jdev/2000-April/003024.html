<PRE>Currently I believe Jabber uses what us java people refer to as 'Green
Threads'. Single process, no operating system control of threading. It also
uses a single thread per socket, mostly because of the amount of 'state'
associated with a socket.

I agree that a pool of threads (shoot, 1000 enough?) servicing all TCP
connections would be enough. And I wouldn't doubt there could be a change to
the TCP/IP layer in Linux and other operating systems to support a massive
number of TCP sockets - the problem is that it wasn't really until recently
(HTTP) that people had to deal with massive number of TCP sockets at all,
and even then they don't have to deal with long-lived connections (i.e.
hours or days) that will be idle most of that time. And having these user
threads in 'groups' of native threads will help utilize multiprocessor
machines (although I do not know how much of a load jabber puts on a
machine, I though the server was currently memory-limited)

I imagine that if the jabber project does not come out with a server
supporting this, some commercial entity will. And, if that commercial entity
starts charging a lot of money, the jabber community will do it then anyways
;-)

David,

When you refer to the stack and heap below, are you referring to the thread
that services the connection?

I believe the way to improve that situation would be to have a pool of
threads servicing many connections.  Most software that uses threads to take
advantage of parallelism does so wastefully.  The ideal situation is to have
one or two processes working (runnable) per CPU.  This works find when other
threads are blocked/sleeping, performance suffers when the number of
runnable tasks is too high in relation to the number of CPUs able to service
them.  Performance also suffers from the overhead of context switches -- and
the memory needed to create all those threads.  One way to solve this is to
have a pool of threads that are all able to service any of the available
connections.  If utilization is light, then probably only one thread will
ever be used, and it will save context switches, as well as memory.  When
the load begins to increase, more threads are called into use.  The key is
to not have too many worker threads unless what a worker thread does can
block.  Too many threads causes degradation in overall performance due to
context switching and synchronization.  Too few and you have network events
that are not dealt with in a timely fashion.

I hope this is useful (for any and all).

-- Jacob.

The number of open sockets is indeed a big issue. The main memory 'eater'
with multiple TCP/IP sockets is the kernel-level memory. At last I heard
(which is another way of saying 'don't hold me to these numbers'), one
active client connection took about 50k.

With Linux, you have to do some kernel reconfiguration to get above 1024
file descriptors per process(temas today explained how to do it without
recompiling the kernel, I need to explore this area of l-k more). a TCP
connection is of course represented by a file descriptor.

Note that much of the memory above is stack for each session. Even if you
somehow eliminated the stack and the heap for each open connection, you'd
find that the kernel memory for each client was about 16k (which is
unswapable). You could possibly get this down to 8k (two 4k pages), but one
4k page does not have enough space to handle an active TCP connection.

At least (from the numbers I've seen) the server is not CPU-limited.

So unless you rewrote the Jabber server to not require separate stack
spaces, and rewrote some operating system kernel to somehow 'share' a large
datablock between many 'idle' TCP sockets, I don't know of any way you could
acheive an extremely large number of users on one server. I do not know of
any operating system that can handle an extremely large number of TCP
connections- 10k is ususlly the first real limit a machine hits.

It would seem the only other feasible you can manage this is to rewrite the
Jabber server to allow clusters of machines. You could also attempt to
modify the Jabber protocol to use UDP, but then you would have something new
that wasn't Jabber anyways.

One aspect of performance I was wondering how Jabber addresses is the number
of open sockets. Does the
Jabber server keep a TCP socket open for each logged in client? What
determines how many sockets can be open
simulatenously using Linux? Does Jabber or Linux do any tricks to increase
the number of open sockets (such as
transforming open, but quiet sockets into some placeholder objects that use
minimal memory until the next message)?
Does anyone know of any implementations that do this? Does anyone know how
big IM/presence servers like Yahoo, ICQ
or AOL handles this?
Our applications have to communicate with tens to hundreds of thousands of
fairly low traffic clients. Our servers run on
Windows NT where the limit on open sockets is a significant issue. Thanks in
advance for any info.

Thnx,

Mike Petras

It sounds more like the test was throttled due to you sending too many
messages at once, rather than any sort of scalability or other type of
limitation in the Jabber server.

Hi ,
        The real issue which I want to highlight is not spammers but the
Scalability of Jabber . The tests which I performed on Jabber clearly showed
that it slows down which is definitely not acceptable in real-life
situations . Jabber has to be more scalable than it is now . Any Thoughts
and Ideas ?
