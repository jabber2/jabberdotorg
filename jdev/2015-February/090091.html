It is the right mailing list. But there is also the
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jdev at conference.jabber.org</A> MUC, which is also a good place to ask questions.

Nice to see that someone is working on Vines's s2s support. :)

&gt;<i> According to XEP-0220 the Authoritative-Server receives via a new
</I>&gt;<i> connection `db:verify` and sends a go or no-go back to the
</I>&gt;<i> Receiving-Server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How can he send the `db:verify` to an other server without having a
</I>&gt;<i> established connection?
</I>
The Receiving Server just established a TCP connection and XMPP stream
to you sending the db:verify. According to XEP-220 &#167; 2.1.2. the
Receiving Server either re-uses an existing XML stream or establishes a
new one. Either way, there is an established connection, the one over
which the Receiving Server send the db:verify to the Authoritative Server.

&gt;<i> According to the RFC a proper XMPP stream is initialized by
</I>&gt;<i> `stream:stream` and `stream:features`. But then we are stuck in a loop
</I>&gt;<i> cause he wants to authenticate again.
</I>
You have to distinguish between authenticated and unauthenticated
streams. You can, and in fact have to, exchange dialback elements over
unauthenticated streams. So there is no loop.

Hope this helps.
