</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Short version:

The authentication only affects &quot;stanzas&quot; - the routable elements,
&lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt;, so dialback elements aren't affected by
this and can be sent even if the session isn't authenticated.

Longer version:

When the Receiving server sends the Authoritative server a &lt;db:verify/&gt;, it
is actually making the assertion that it has authenticated the
Authoritative server to be the authority for a particular domain, and as
such is giving the Authoritative server permission to send &lt;db:verify/&gt;
responses for that domain. So you can't send a &lt;db:verify/&gt; result unless
you've received that permission.

In principle, an Authoritative server could reasonably just send any old
stanzas once it's received a &lt;db:verify/&gt;, since after all if it's the
authority it may as well - but this isn't done (and will break/confuse
servers by sending stanzas in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction anyway). All this is
mostly because dialback wasn't really treated as a &quot;proper&quot; authentication
method, and wasn't really analysed, and despite it working really well for
years, the community just didn't understand it - as such, there's a lot of
weird choices in the system. The one-way directionality of S2S is just one
case of this.

As such, if you're looking at all this with a fresh pair of eyes and
thinking it doesn't make sense, you're right - and between XEP-0288 and
XEP-0344, you might find some attempts to clean this up a bit. More input
is always welcome, on standards@

Dave.
