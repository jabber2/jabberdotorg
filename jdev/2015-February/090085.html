<PRE>Hey guys

First of all I would like to thank you for all your feedback. I don't
know that the idea is so heavily discussed (after the nice post from
stefan) and on active development.

&gt;<i> So &quot;XMPP as a social network&quot; is defenitely an idea being actively
</I>&gt;<i> worked on.
</I>
I like :-).

</I>
I don't know that Buddycloud is `just` a backend, Simon Tennant. Due to
that the frontend is to protect. At the time I wrote the initial e-mail
I thought on something like buddycloud compared with tomcat. And I don't
like Tomcat (and its vulnerabilities) very much, even java, but not to
bring java to the front(end) is a thing I can get used to it. :). So
I've get bc a go.

Not people but sysadmins. I don't want to mess up my server with java
ruby on rails and python installations.

Nice work and hang on your plan :-) :

We are working on a &quot;social network&quot; in python, and looking for devs !
The project is well advanced: <A HREF="http://salut-a-toi.org">http://salut-a-toi.org</A> (demo on
<A HREF="http://www.libervia.org">http://www.libervia.org</A>).

Still waiting for the validation mail :-)

Folks, we should keep this thread up, that everyone can share updates on
his projects and roadmaps.

Cheers.
