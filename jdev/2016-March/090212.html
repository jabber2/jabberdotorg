</I>&gt;<i> Other XMPP clients I use seem to (sometimes after awhile) detect this situation somehow and tell me I'm no longer in the room (or try to re-join).  How are they doing this?  Is this some quirk of the external component protocol where normally Prosody would generate this kind of stanza to a client?  Or what else could I be missing?  I really need to solve this issue...

There was a bug in Prosody before 0.9.10 that caused &quot;unavailable&quot; presences
to occupants to never reach the users on remote servers as the s2s streams
were closed before sending those stanzas [1]. I can't tell if chat.yax.im has
already updated to that version.

But even with that there's no guarantee it will always succeed: if the s2s
streams are closed your unavailable presence won't be sent before the server
shuts down.

Regards,
Thijs
