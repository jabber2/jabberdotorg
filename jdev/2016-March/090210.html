Is this some quirk of the external component protocol where normally Prosody would generate this kind of stanza to a client?  Or what else could I be missing?  I really need to solve this issue...

</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m also interested by this issue, this is annoying for the users. I already asked for ways to solve this (on the jdev@ muc, for example, I believe), and the conclusion was to ping my own in-room JID (e.g. <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jdev at conference.example.com</A>/MyNick) once in a while.

</I>&gt;<i> If the room considers that the client is not in the room, then it should get an error instead of a ping result.

This is probably as good as it gets, but sadly even this isn&#8217;t reliable - a MUC room could send you an error even if you&#8217;re in the room, if it&#8217;s configured not to allow IQs or such.
