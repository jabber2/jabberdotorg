<PRE>One of the factors to take into consideration is that while ssl provides
an encrypted tunnle for the client to server connection, it is almost
always plain text on either side of that tunnel. Generally this includes
while it is being maintained by the server. (store and forward for users
off line)

What David is recomending is that if the data needs to be encrypted from
one user to anotheer, then the proper place for that encryption to be
done is on the client.

Another way to look at it is like e-mail. The reason you set up a ssh
tunnel to collect pop mail is not to encrypt the data you are
transfering, it is to encrypt the authentication process to prevent
someone from sniffing your password, and passing themselves off as you,
while they send threatening e-mail to the president, or knock down
yahoo's web servers. Unless you use some form of encryption on the
message itself that can only be decrypted by the intended recipient(s)
_Anyone_ at your ISP with admin rights, or on any server storing your
e-mail along the way, can read your e-mail. 

Likewise for Jabber. If you look around, you will find jabber clients on
various platforms that will use pgp, gpg, or openpgp to encrypt messages
you send, or decrypt messages you recieve. there may be others, but
these are relatively common on a variety of platforms. 

Then again, I could be wrong.
