<PRE>Hello,

I just browsed the FAQ and the many post of this mailing list to see if
my question was not already answered in the past.  I didn't find it but
if somehow I missed it I would like to apologize to the group and,
well...  invite you to throw the appropriate rocks at me.

We would like to host a Jabber server as an added feature of our
services and are trying to understand the load capacity of Jabber, the
jabber.org popular version, and compare it with the commercial version
published by Jabber Inc.  It appears that Jabber Inc. went to great
length to reorganize and optimize the Jabber server code in order to
make it scalable to 100,000 and more concurrent users.  In particular
they made it

- Multithreaded,  supporting multiprocessor servers.
- Added support for server farm architecture.
- Enhanced the number of simultaneous maintained sockets from 1,000 to
up to 25,000.
- Redesigned the internal database from a flat file to an optional
database
- Enhanced reliability.

What is the experience of this group regarding the number of concurrent
users that the Jabber.org server can serve?  And what is its
reliability, Jabber Inc. claims that it is potentially poor needing
frequent restarts versus their version which supposedly is a lot more
reliable?

Thank you for your passionate replies.

Mike Kronenberg
