<PRE>I have posted repeatedly to the conference room and it seems as if either 
no one knows the answer or no one wants to respond (hope I didn't over 
extend my welcome). In any event I cannot seem to get the conference 
rooms to work any where but internally. 

When I try to get to conference.jabber.org I cannot. Nor can I use the 
find option, all of which returns a 502 error message, Server not found, 
which doesn't make any sense to me since I can telnet from the box to 
that server, I can also telnet externally into the box through port 5269, 
the jabber.xml is fine as I use in on another box that I setup and it 
works there. I also get the same error message when I try to use the MSN 
or icq transports.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated as I have now been working on this 
same problem for nearly a week.

Thanks.
