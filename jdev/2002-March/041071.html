<PRE>Hi List -

I asked this question on JADMIN, but got no responses at all, so I guess
they don't know.  So may I bow to everyone's great wisdom, and send the
message to this list?

Having a great time with jabberd-1.4.2 on SCO OpenServer 5.0.6!  Some
questions, if I might.

1. What is the difference - in practice - between the &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot;
   configurations of conferencing?  It seems to me that under either setup,
   any user can create and/or enter any chatroom on the system.

2. In the sample &quot;public&quot; configuration, I see a &lt;secret&gt; tag - I assume that
   implies a password to access a conference room?  How would one supply this
   password.  With that tag, -nobody- (even the admin user) can enter that
   &quot;admin&quot; room.

3. I believe I read in the archives that there is no way yet for a user to
   easily &quot;see&quot; a list of existing chatrooms - am I correct?

4. Finally, is it possible to limit the system to a certain group of pre-
   defined chatrooms?  I'd like to control which chatrooms exist, and 
   prevent people from creating their own chatrooms on the fly.  Doable?

Thanks so much for your help and patience with a newbie!

Glen
