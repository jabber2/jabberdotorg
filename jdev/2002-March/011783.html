</I>&gt;<i> Gunjan, I don't think it's the Net::Jabber code that's at fault here. What it sounds like is that you've given the Send the wrong type of argument. When I set up presence (this is based on examples from the book), I create a Net::Jabber::Presence object, fill it appropriately, and pass it to $connection-&gt;Send() (not PresenceSend). It works for me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It's a 'wrong type of argument' problem, but not with Send(); in this case
it's with the new() method of Net::Jabber::Presence() - called in the
handle_presence() callback in the script. As Piers, and the nj10021.html
article, has already mentioned, what is happening is that Net::Jabber is
now sending two values to the callbacks - the first being a session ID,
the second being the one that we really want to pass to the new() method.
Pre-1.0021, it just sent the latter value.

&gt;<i> Also, be aware of a few things in Programming Jabber: for one, it's got *lots* of typos and errata. I haven't found anything yet that affects me in the code examples, but there is always the possibility that something has gone amiss. I suggest you check the Errata page for the book on the O'Reilly website. Also, as you have already pointed out, the Net::Jabber libs are a moving target, as is Jabber itself, to some extent. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Stephen - I try to check the Errata page regularly, but please don't
hesitate to bug me by email (<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">dj.adams at pobox.com</A>) with anything you find
and want to ask about or thwap me over the head about :-)

Cheers
