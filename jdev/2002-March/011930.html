</I>[snip]

Hanging out in #gaim on OPN, here are the two reasons I hear most
often:

    1. &quot;I'd use it, but nobody else I know does.  All my friends
	are on (AIM|MSN|ICQ|Y!M).&quot;  and &quot;I don't know anybody on
	Jabber.&quot;

    2. &quot;Where is/are the server(s)?&quot; and &quot;It's not stable.  I keep
	getting kicked off.&quot;

The first I counter by trying to improve Gaim's Jabber plugin support.
Being a multi-protocol IM client, it's easy for people running it to
add another account.  Thus, to the &quot;I don't know anybody on Jabber,&quot; I
reply with &quot;Yes, you do.  Most of the people on this channel have
jabber.org accounts.  It's easy to get one with Gaim now.&quot;  That
frequently gets 'em interested enough to at least *get* a jabber.org
account.

I also avoid adding a proprietary protocol's user to my buddylist if
they have, or are capable of having, a jabber.org account.  In fact:
since my Y!M account is not well-known, I don't have an ICQ account at
all, I absolutely *refuse* to even consider M$N and I run &quot;permit only&quot;
on AIM, it's easy for me to &quot;encourage&quot; folks to contact me via Jabber
instead of the others :).

As far as the server(s) question... well, that's a trickier one.  It
does seem to me that jabber.org seems to be getting more stable.  But
to be brutally honest: it's kind of hard to beat AOL's AIM reliability
w/o a helluva server farm and a mind-boggling amount of bandwidth ;).

I've thought about pitching to my ISP the idea of them hosting a Jabber
server for their customers.  Maybe if enough ISPs did this, and linked
their servers together (I'm *guessing* that's what s2s is for?): ISPs
could offer Jabber to their customers as a value-added thing and offer
the user-base exposure via s2s w/o one or two or a few in particular
having to carry an excessive amount of non-customer load?  But the
server codebase would have to be rock-solid for this to work.  As
anybody who is familiar with the ISP landscape right now should be
well-aware: ISPs have been cutting-back on resources.  They won't be
looking to add workload for something that may or may not be regarded
as a value-add by their customers.  Especially during infancy.

And there'd have to be dependable, easy-to-use, easy-to-install, easy-
to-configure, and reasonably familiar-looking clients for them to
offer.  May sound simple, but take it from somebody whose been &quot;asking
around&quot; about M$-Win clients for possible deployment at work: it ain't
necessarily so.

In the final analysis: part of the problem is certainly a &quot;chicken and
egg&quot; delimma.  This will only be solved by steadily and mercilessly
chipping away at it, user-by-user.


Regards,
Jim
