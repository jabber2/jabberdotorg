<PRE>RE: [JDEV] Question on using NIO with SAXI agree with your analysis. There are lots of things that need to be done here. Peter had run a poll at Jabbercentral at my request and so far 54% voted for reliable gateways (which is not something Jabber can control) but I have not seen any coordinated advocacy. 

&gt;<i>First of all, I am surprised that there is no Jabber Advocacy mailing list - has one ever been proposed?  Or maybe this is the role of the Jabber Foundation/Council.  Either way, it doesn't seem obvious or grass roots enough.
</I>
I would like to see a section on Jabber.org devoted to advocacy. I am willing to sign up on a new mailing list, but the problem is that there seems to be a lack on interest in advocacy in the Jabber community. 

What we need is a group of people to step up and say I am interested in Jabber advocacy. That's the first step. 

Regards,
Ashvil
