Well, in my opinion right now we're getting out of an &quot;IM slump&quot; --
there was a *lot* of talk about non-IM uses for Jabber, and the people
who are interested in that have mostly clustered together. Don't worry,
as much as I want Jabber to be IM, I understand that it is more and
there are people who work on that. I prefer to work on mostly the IM
side for now, because that's what I want to do. But pub/sub is something
I've been asking for for quite some time now, so I'm trying to push
that.

There's no way anyone can restrict Jabber back down to &quot;just an IM
system&quot; now - until/unless there are separate protocols for &quot;simple IM&quot;
and &quot;services&quot; - in which case you can be sure there will be a common
base.
