Not even necessary.  Just let would-be users know that they register
through the client.

I need to learn how to use it.  Especially the &quot;suspend and connect
from another machine&quot; feature.  I want jabberd to start at boot,
though.

Ack.  Is there a known workaround or fix?

Thanks for these tips.  I tried a few out, and Exodus looks quite
ideal :-).  I especially like the installation method -- unzip this
file where you want and run the app.  If the router at home weren't so
dead I could install it remotely, hehe, (except for the shortcuts in
convenient locations).
