&gt;<i> Can someone tell me if there is any organised Jabber advocacy?

No.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [Long rant follows]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I get the feeling that Jabber is a great standard with way less 
</I>&gt;<i> publicity than it deserves.  I can see the day where Microsoft wins the 
</I>&gt;<i> IM wars in the same way as they won the browser wars, and Jabber lives 
</I>&gt;<i> on as nothing more than a niche product for the rest of its life.
</I>
Yep.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Back before AOL started blocking Jabber servers, the mentality was that 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber was for us - we were right because we ran Jabber - less educated 
</I>&gt;<i> users ran AIM, but we could still talk to them.  This isn't the case now.
</I>
Well, it can be. Someone needs to make aim-t not crash constantly and 
I'll be ok since I run my own server ;)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think there are ways we can work against this, and maximise the 
</I>&gt;<i> chances for Jabber to flourish, but I'm sure that there are many I 
</I>&gt;<i> haven't thought of, so I look forward to other peoples ideas. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anyone out there that is of the mindset that we shouldn't do 
</I>&gt;<i> anything, and let people judge Jabber on it's technical merits alone?  
</I>&gt;<i> There is something to be said for the argument that time is better spent 
</I>&gt;<i> improving Jabber than fighting political battles that we cannot win, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that without some exposure to Jabber, the public are not even 
</I>&gt;<i> going to think about it let alone switch to it.  Remember, we are 
</I>&gt;<i> working against MSN Messenger icons on every Windows desktop from XP up; 
</I>&gt;<i> those annoying AOL ads where the schoolgirl says that she is so pleased 
</I>&gt;<i> she can chat with her friends since AOL invented Instant Messaging.
</I>
I'm fairly certain that most of us want Jabber to be promoted, but most 
of the people involved in Jabber are not the PR type.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, I am surprised that there is no Jabber Advocacy mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list - has one ever been proposed?  Or maybe this is the role of the 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber Foundation/Council.  Either way, it doesn't seem obvious or grass 
</I>&gt;<i> roots enough.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How about a Jabber webring?  Anything that can group together all the 
</I>&gt;<i> great websites out there can show that there is a significant community 
</I>&gt;<i> behind Jabber, and it is more than the sum of all its parts.  Is there a 
</I>&gt;<i> way we can set up a Jabber ad server, so we can promote each others 
</I>&gt;<i> products on our websites?
</I>
I've never liked webrings. They always seem so cheesy... and ads... I 
don't want any more ads. :)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Corporate Support.  It's good to see companies like Jabber Inc out 
</I>&gt;<i> there, as it give the technology a corporate farce, but lets face it - 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber Inc doesn't have much in the way of industry muscle.  What are 
</I>&gt;<i> the chances of getting some major companies involved?  From what I can 
</I>&gt;<i> tell, the only major player that is showing any support is IBM, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> strange, because Jabber is (at least in part) directly competing against 
</I>&gt;<i> its Lotus Sametime product.  What about seeing if Apple could be 
</I>&gt;<i> convinced to place an icon on the next MacOS desktop.  Redhat should be 
</I>&gt;<i> a sure bet.  Putting an icon to a Linux client on every desktop install 
</I>&gt;<i> of Redhat would increase our userbase and give Redhat a feature that 
</I>&gt;<i> they appear to be lacking when compared to Microsoft's offering.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> same should be true for any other Linux distributions, but I have yet to 
</I>&gt;<i> hear of one such company that is even running a Jabber server yet.  
</I>&gt;<i> Also, there are other companies - Sun, Palm, Nokia, Sony, etc that make 
</I>&gt;<i> platforms that could benefit from Jabber.  Then there are web based 
</I>&gt;<i> companies - all the free mail providers that could use an offering 
</I>&gt;<i> similar to MSN Messenger that Hotmail is offering; Portal services etc.  
</I>&gt;<i> The list goes on.
</I>
Yes, except that in order to get a company to get behind an entire 
technology like Jabber you have to get organized connections into 
multiple layers of a company. That's something which is very difficult 
for an Open Source organization to accomplish -- typically the companies 
which incorporate such technologies do so of their own will...


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Media coverage.  All the stories about AOL blocking MS, IM wars and even 
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability stories - Jabber is almost never mentioned.  Jabber Inc 
</I>&gt;<i> do a good job with their press releases, but there has to be a way to 
</I>&gt;<i> make the media more aware of what Jabber is, and what it does (and why)
</I>
I've certainly tried a few times, but we just don't have a good enough 
handle on why the general population should care about Jabber. 
Personally, I'm having a hard enough time selling it to fellow open 
source developers, the same people who refuse to MS Office documents 
because they're closed! (Yet they're fine using AIM/ICQ/MSN/Yahoo!)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IETF.  Can someone who understands the inner workings of the IETF give 
</I>&gt;<i> us a short summary of what process we need to go though to get Jabber 
</I>&gt;<i> listed as an Internet standard, and an honest estimate of our chances of 
</I>&gt;<i> succeeding?
</I>
We've tried this route twice and have several people involved in trying 
to make this work.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ISP's. The idea behind Jabber is that each ISP can offer an IM service 
</I>&gt;<i> in the same way they now offer mail and news servers.  Does anyone know 
</I>&gt;<i> of any ISP that is actually doing this?  Can we get some examples of how 
</I>&gt;<i> popular it is?  Feedback from the customers?  Can anyone think of any 
</I>&gt;<i> ways to encourage ISP's to offer a Jabber server other than writing 
</I>&gt;<i> emails?  Can anyone provide an example email that we can send to our 
</I>&gt;<i> local ISP's?
</I>
Yes, there are several somewhat major ISPs which have adopted Jabber. I 
think the only way this will happen is if the actual customers of the 
ISP talk to them, not outsiders.
