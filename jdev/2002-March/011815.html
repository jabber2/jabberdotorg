<PRE>Hello all you JDEVers

--short version for busy executives--

Join the standards-jig mailing list - it's not just to discuss standards
compliance - now it's _the_ place to talk about the protocol present and
future. The future of Jabber depends on the discussion that goes on there.

--longer version for, er, busy executives--

This is a short(ish) email to alert those that don't know about the
standards-jig mailing list, or how it's role in the community has
(recently) changed.

The list was originally formed to host the discussions purely related to
standards compliance, conformance, and testing. That is, protocol-related
standards. 

Recently there's been a drive to improve process, flow, and communications
regarding the development of the Jabber protocol. In the past there have 
been 'island' mailing lists formed for specific Jabber Interest Groups (JIGs)
that talked about specific parts of the protocol, present and future. 
Now, all that discussion is moving into the standards-jig mailing list.

The standards-jig mailing list is now _the_ place to discuss the existing
protocol and future enhancements and extensions. It's where ideas for
new proposals can be discussed, thoughts and opinions rallied, and chat
about important subjects such as i18n (internationalization), encryption
and security, and publish/subscribe.

So while this list is for the discussion of development of _implementations_
of the protocol, the standards-jig list is for the discussion of the
_protocol_ itself. 

It's a list that's perhaps more important than you might think. So may
I humbly suggest you consider having a look. You'll all be welcome!

Kind regards
