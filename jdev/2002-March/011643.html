<PRE>In that case, the IPv6 network would have the same problem with SMTP and
NNTP servers, wouldn't it ? I don't think that HTTP tunneling of SMTP/NNTP
is planned, but perhaps I'm wrong...

I don't think that HTTP-tunneling of everything is a good thing.
The point is : firewalls were &quot;created&quot; to filter access to network
ressources. The HTTP port is opened on most of them to allow web-surfing and
webserver hosting. If every protocols get HTTP-tunneled, the firewall
becomes completely useless, because all protocols will go through the HTTP
port. So, what you'll get will be HTTP-level firewalls that will filter the
tunneled  protocols...

I really think that HTTP-tunneling is a short-time workaround to solve the
current firewall problems. Making Jabber accepted as a standard protocol
like SMTP or HTTP by network administrators will perhaps take time, but it's
probably the only good solution...

Objet : Re: [JDEV] jabberd and Proxies : leave AOL alone


Before we go picking at AOL, it's worth noting that an IPv6 network
has no way of accessing our IPv4 internet without proxies, unless your
IPv6 network also has a valid IPv4 block mapped to it.  In that case,
putting your server on the Internet will be impossible, even if you
aren't using AOL.  Having an HTTP-based s2s sidesteps all these issues
in a very convenient way.
