<PRE>mikem has a nice server-side solution for #2.
It's a group messaging transport.  You subscribe to
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">whateveryouwant at whateveryoucallthetransport.yourhostname.yourdomain</A>,
and then anything sent to that address gets forwarded to you.

</I>&gt;<i> the WAN, I can't have more than one workgroup on either end (unless I

</I>&gt;<i> recipient or a whole workgroup.  Clearly this is clumsy, but we live
</I>&gt;<i> with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I recently added a Linux workstation to the mix.  No winpopup, although

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber seems an obvious choice as it allows me to run my own server.
</I>&gt;<i> This is useful for both security and bandwidth reasons.  So features I'd
</I>&gt;<i> be interested in seeing (or suggestions of a client that allows any of
</I>&gt;<i> these ideas) are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1- the ability to interact with winpopup
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2- the ability to configure groups (pseudo-workgroups) and point and
</I>&gt;<i> click a message to the members in one go.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3- the ability to select graphically all desired recipients of a single
</I>&gt;<i> message.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think two and three are included in ICQ, but I don't want to blast
</I>&gt;<i> inter-office stuff all over the internet if I can help it!  I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> found a jabber client that will do this, but I haven't installed them
</I>&gt;<i> all... However the documentation I've scanned doesn't seem to mention
</I>&gt;<i> these abilities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any comments this might evoke would be appreciated.  Please CC me as I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not yet on the list...
