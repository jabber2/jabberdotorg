<PRE>Hi Vikas,

Probably I was also at your stage a couple of months ago...i took the following path...

Best way to know jabber is to install, and run it first of all, it gives you a good excitement to start with, configure transports, configure other components, and setup your own (so called .IM service), start using those funky clients and ask people to look at what you have achieved, I am sure people will be amazed with that setup, specially knowing that you have not even opened the details of Jabber platform yet and still have an amazing IM platform up and running!:)

Next, I would suggest to refer to the documents, how-to's at <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org">http://docs.jabber.org</A> (i am not sure if the URL is changed???) and also start referring other Jabber sites like <A HREF="http://www.jabbercentral.com">http://www.jabbercentral.com</A> you will see, lots of news, and other important links there. 

If you want to be more adventurous, than I would suggest referring to &quot;Programming Jabber&quot; book by our own DJ. Since you (and me to) are from India, there is no Indian reprint available as of now, but the book is available at <A HREF="http://safari.oreilly.com">http://safari.oreilly.com</A> for online viewing with some minimal charge (i think its affordable in Indian Rupees too!). I think they also offer a trial account. Thanks DJ for that nice piece of work, and thanks Oreilly for providing that online:)

Once you have the Jabber platform up and running you can start experimenting with various settings and configurations, and you will start understanding the internals of the server, and communication protocol also. There are some cool Perl modules available at CPAN to get you started with writing some small perl programs to communicate with Jabber server, and do some funny things, again DJ has published some cool articles on the Perl modules (accidentally these modules are also written by him only:-) that you can refer. I am sure with that information, you will feel at home with Jabber platform, and I am sure people at JDEV and conference.jabber.org/JDEV are always here to help!:)

Cheers, and have fun with Jabber!

-GC
