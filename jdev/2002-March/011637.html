<PRE>&gt;<i>Proposals:
</I>&gt;<i>1)  &amp; 2) &amp; 3) &amp; My proposal:
</I>&gt;<i>...
</I>&gt;<i>AOL comes over and decides to be a cheater and signs on as a 
</I>&gt;<i>user/server.  Then it queries the registry directly for the list of servers 
</I>&gt;<i>and kaboom, all the Smart Forwarders just became Dumb Ignorant Idiots.. 
</I>&gt;:<i>)  Thus I think a certificate-based authorization is required to connect 
</I>&gt;<i>to the registry.  The certificates are only issued to those that are 
</I>&gt;<i>approved.  Bigger overhead, but it will lead to better interoperability.
</I>&gt;<i>What do you all think?
</I>
That would sort of make the Jabber community more &quot;closed&quot;, and even then AOL will 
still kill it when they see too much traffic coming from one IP adress.. (maybe they'll 
just do a quick nmap to see if any jabber server is running on it)..
It's still a lot of effort for something that's basically at the mercy of AOL.

You also forgot to include one proposal, letting the server do the conversion between 
the xml jabber protocol and the property protocol (like it does now) but then send it 
back to the client, to let the client send it to the the property format. This however still 
excludes mobile clients. Maybe a combination of this system and your proposel would 
work best..
For example let's say my client wants to comunnicate with AIM, it sends a message 
to the aim transport like it normally would, then AIMt let's the client choose wether it 
wants to get the converted binary data back itself (you are the &quot;redirector&quot;) or wether 
it wants to choose (or let AIMt choose) another (public) &quot;redirector&quot; for this binary 
data.. (these two steps could be made into one ofcourse)

This requires some work to implement (a bit too much if you ask me) just cause AOL 
doesn't want to play with us, but it would be the only solution that would hold out for a 
while (maybe long enough for jabber to grow big). It does need more up to date 
transport codes, but knowing that all the work you did for it won't be swept away 
because AOL decides to block server IPs might be a bit more motivating for the 
developers.

Implementing the streams of binary data etc. is ofcourse a lot of work, but I think 
manny agree that stuff like OOB data needs some work too (out of band data doesn't 
always have to be file tranfers, can be a full duplex binary stream as well), wich 
ofcourse could be used for this. Better specifications and implementations (one good 
lib could be used by all the transports) of OOB data wouldn't hurt anyone I think :)

Advantages of this method:

- you can choose between privacy &amp; security (the only one who sees your data is you 
and the server,ofcourse you still need to trust the server, see below) or a client that's 
not any more complex then todays (for mobiles etc.) that unfortunaly has to trust 
others with it's property IM sessions.

- these public &quot;redirectors&quot; for the binary streams don't have to be full featured jabber 
clients (maybe they can be, but they don't have to be). They'll be extremly simple 
programs. With some options to let it limit CPU and bandwith usage I think you can 
find a lot of people willing to run something like this.. (<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">pissoffAOL at home</A> anyone? :)

- almost transparant intergration with todays clients, the redirector program can run 
seperate from your client on your own machine, so no need for all the clients to 
implement this on their own.

- it works! AOL can't block *every* IP outthere.. espc if you choose to let your own 
computer handle all the streams. they simply can't block you on the IP level. Maybe 
they can still find some things that are wrong with the protocol, but this was always 
the strenght of Jabber, these things can get adjusted serverside, updating all the 
clients at once.

- maybe this model can be used for more then just chat transports.. who knows what 
usefull things will come out of it :) also some good OOB data specs would be 
welcomed by the community..

Disadvantages:

If you choose to handle your own binary streams (you are the &quot;redirector&quot;):

- adds complexity to the client (a bit), still acceptable for desktop machines though

- Security: you have to trust the server you connect to, the server has control over 
binary streams that are send from *your* computer. Restricting your &quot;redirector&quot; to 
connect to only the IP's you want is a requirment, else it's too much open for abuse 
like DDOS attacks. This requires a Jabber client to know where the AOL server is 
wich is a bit against the Jabber design philosophy.. still acceptable though IMHO. With 
this securty measure in place the only thing it could be abused for is a DDOS attack 
against eg. AOL (if that's what your &quot;redirector' is allowed to connect to) or that your 
redirector is used for sessions that are not your own (yey appear to come from your 
IP). Again.. if you trust the server you connect to this is all not a problem..

if you choose to use a public &quot;redirector&quot;:

- Security: your data travels over other peoples redirectors.. 
However if you trust the server, and the server only connects to trusted redirectors 
(or you can tell the server to connect to one, for example I could use my desktop 
machine to &quot;redirect&quot; for my cellphone) this could still be within the limits of 
reasonable security. 
You always have to trust your server anyway, and if you thought your IM sessions on 
ICQ, AIM or MSN were safe in the first place you needed the wakeup call anyway. (If 
they were they'd use something like SSL and it wouldn't be a problem redirecting 
them over servers you don't trust anyway)

The biggest disadvantage of this probably is that noone wants to build it.. for now we'll 
just play cat and mouse with AOL for a while (there's manny manny different IP 
adresses we can use for our AIM/ICQ transport.. I wonder if they'll really block them 
all.. :P). Maybe if it doesn't work out that way we'll free some resources for this.. but for 
now I doubt I can do it on my own.. (not familiar enough with jabbers internal working 
yet)..

Even though probably noone wants to make something like this for now, it could still 
be intresting to discuss what the best and most efficiant way of solving this problem 
is.. :)
