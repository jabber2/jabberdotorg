This is exactly the implementation that I independently figured out last
week (independently because I hadn't been keeping up on JDEV email); we've
got our server name set to example.com and an &quot;alias to&quot; to put in the
real.name.example.com which is the full A name of the server.  Gabber is
set to connect to login to real.name.example.com and JIDs now can be
specified as <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at example.com.</A>  Using an SRV record to locate the real name
would be better, but this really isn't too bad, and we haven't noticed any
confusion in the client.

Incidentally, we've also got an &quot;alias to&quot; to &quot;localhost&quot; so people can
do SSH port forwarding to the jabber server; they forward port 5223 on
the server to localhost port 5223 and specify localhost as their server.
