Ok, I may have missed some questions/answers on this already, so sorry
if this is repeat stuff...

Are you trying to get to conferencing.jabber.org from a client connected
to jabber.org or connected to your.own.server?

If the latter, can your server see / connect to any external Jabber
server/services?

If so, is it just a conference room join that's not happening, or
can't you do a (e.g.) version query on the conferencing component
either?

If you're connecting from your own server, are there any clues
in the debug logs?

cheers
dj
