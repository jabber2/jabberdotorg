<PRE>Sounds intriguing, and I'm sure that at least some folks in the Jabber
community would be willing to help out. Personally I'd like to see a copy
of your research proposal so that I can understand your data requirements
and your protections for anonymity. Once I'm comfortable with that, I'd be
happy to strongarm, er, persuade others into participating as well.

In true open source fashion you could of course just post your research
proposal as a URL to get maximum feedback. :) If not, send it to me
offlist (email and jabber addresses below).

Peter

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is it I need? Specifically just a database describing

</I>&gt;<i> personal information, everyone can be anonymized as numbers 
</I>&gt;<i> and the data will still be ok.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I found out about Jabber recently and since it is still 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly client/server I was hoping that perhaps you have DBs 
</I>&gt;<i> on the server describing users and their contacts. I do not

</I>&gt;<i> man), personal information (I want research not $), or 
</I>&gt;<i> anything else no one wants to give out. Since I will be 
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with aggregate statistics I won't really know much 
</I>&gt;<i> about a specific user anyway. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, to make this email short (too late I guess) I was 
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if anyone could help me out and let me know if 
</I>&gt;<i> jabber servers have this kind of information or and if so 
</I>&gt;<i> if I could &quot;mine&quot; any servers to get some user info. Any 
</I>&gt;<i> help is appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My full research proposal is available to anyone upon request.
