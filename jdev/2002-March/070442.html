<PRE>Hi,


I'm in my last but one year at the University of Ghent in Belgium
(<A HREF="http://www.rug.ac.be">http://www.rug.ac.be</A>) where I'm attending my Diploma of the Second
Cycle (licentiaat) in Computer Science. For my last year, I have to work
on my thesis. We can choose from subject that our university presents to
us or we can choose a subject of our own (but we have to do this before
next week :( ).


Because I'm very attracted to Jabber and XML I would like to do
something with it. I personally thought of a news report system through
Jabber. For example, there are a lot of newsgroups now, only available
through a browser. Sometimes you would like to follow a discussion very
close, so it would be very helpfull if you could be notified in real
time when a new message arrives at that discussion. Because of the open
source thing Jabber has, this could be &quot;easy&quot; implemented (by &quot;easy&quot; I
mean that it would me much harder to do with systems like ICQ, MSN,...).
So I would like to do the inverse thing of jogger
(<A HREF="http://jogger.jabber.org">http://jogger.jabber.org</A>): instead of &quot;me&quot; bringing messages to the web
I would like to have the web bring messages to me. So it would have the
functionality of <A HREF="http://www.jabberbuddy.com/watcher.html">http://www.jabberbuddy.com/watcher.html</A> but I would
like to have it available to more people and continuing the
decentralised spirit of jabber.


Because I wouldn't like to reinvent the wheel I contacted you first,
because maybe this already exists or maybe you have a much better idea.
My goal is to bring Jabber much much closer to the &quot;ordinary&quot; home user
or &quot;ordinary&quot; web developer, I want them to see that jabber has much
more in it than e.g. ICQ or MSN. I tried to convince some friends of me
to go to using Jabber, but they just didn't saw nor I could convince
them (or not all of them) why it was important to have another
IM-system taking up their RAM.



hoping to hear from you soon
greetings
Mattias Campe
