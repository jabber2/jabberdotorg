<PRE>Hello,

I am attempting to use xdb_sql with Jabber and am wanting to use the MSN
transport. Would it be possible to request the code as well?

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Eddie Conner



(From posting found on the internet)

We are running a version of the MSN transport here that works with
xdb_sql.  If you'd like to run it I can email a tarball to you, but it
won't be easy to set up.  There are quite a few things you have to do to
xdb_sql before it will work with it.  You'll have to add a table to your
mySQL db, add query definitions to the xdb_sql.xml file and there was a
bug in xdb_sql that prevented the msn transport from working correctly
with it that we fixed.  I don't know if this bug has been fixed in the
newest version of xdb_sql or not.  The bug was due to the fact that the
msn transport sends values to xdb as attributes of an xml tag instead of
as children tags I think.  It may have been the other way around.  This
functionality was broken in version 1.1 of xdb_sql, if it was fixed I'm
sure the maintainer will chime in.  If it hasn't been fixed I need to
send him our fix.  If you want to give it a shot let me know.  Just
realize that it will be pretty complicated.
