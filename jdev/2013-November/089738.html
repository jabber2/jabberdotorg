So each server presumably makes an unattended leap-of-faith in order to get
your pinning info, and then every server has to store the pinning info for
every other server they ever contact?

If the certificate was *also* signed by a CA, you'd at least limit the
initial LoF, and protect yourself against subsequent CA compromise - which
is basically the attack that Perrin et al consider. I hold that DANE
provides security against *initial* CA compromise as well, and obviates the
need to pinning as such - it certainly requires an infrastructure upgrade,
but provides a security upgrade as well.

As such, I suspect your quote above has several flaws:

a) DANE does not require a CA.

b) DANE does work with self-signed certificates.

c) DANE provides a higher level of security compared to mere pinning.

d) DANE also puts direct trust into the hands of the service admin.

Dave.
