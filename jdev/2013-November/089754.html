</I>This thinking that there is only ONE MASTER ROOT KEY that has to be trusted
is a fantasy.

1. Most likely will there be a set of MASTER ROOT KEYS
2. And even if it would be true [it is not] then what percentage of the
Internet users would put their trust in a key that is ultimately
geopolitically aligned with the US? And why should we not care about the
other users?)

The RFC is also very clear on this and mentions this:

&quot;This prevents an untrustworthy signer from compromising anyone's keys
except those in their own subdomains.&quot;

Let me give this another try with an example that shows that ANYONE in the
domain-chain can compromise the trust.

For simplicity we use jabber.ir but it works equally well on other/longer
domain names).

Public Keys:
&quot;.&quot; - Public Key shipped with the resolver. This is the MASTER ROOT KEY
.IR - generated their own private/public key pair. Public key is signed by
ROOT.
JABBER.ir - generated their own private/public key pair. Public key is
signed by .IR

&quot;.IR&quot; is the attacker. &quot;.IR&quot; has access to the private key (they generated
it).

User requests via DNSSEC the certificate for jabber.ir.

The attacker intercepts DNSSEC traffic and answers with a new public key
(signed by &quot;.IR&quot; private key) and sends this new public key to the user.
User authenticates and verifies that jabber.ir's public key is signed by
.IR. (and .IR's key is signed by &quot;.&quot;).

Pinning solves this. DANE does not.
