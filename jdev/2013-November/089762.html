No it would not. This is the wrong assumption. The ROOT or the TLD KEY can
be (ab)used to perform a active attack. Nobody but the targeted user would
see the changed public key and then it would vanish.

This attack and vulnerability in the TLS authentication has been recognized
by all major browser manufactures. Pinning (on top of DNSSEC) is being
implemented as we speak. Why jabber tries so hard of being less secure than
the web browser is a mystery to me.
