Another which didn't understood.

I just said want to be able to use weak security. It's about having the 
choice.

Maybe because I don't need strong encryption or mabye because I have 
devices which are unable to use strong encryption, maybe because of ...

There might be a lot of reasons why I might not want or why I might be 
unable to use strong encryption on a specific server, device or whatever.

</I>
If I do look at the facts, there are those special letters. And if you 
don't have physical control about your server (e.g. if you don't sleep 
besides it), those letters enable some unnamed government to get your 
keys without you noticing it, except if you have secured them by a 
passphrase or similiar you would have to enter whenever you start a 
service. (That means they can e.g. show such a letter to whoever 
physically protects your server and then you are compromised). And those 
letters do compromise all the CAs in that country too. And it doesn't 
help me, if that country isn't a dictorship when that country feels free 
to handle everyone from the outside like a possible terrorist, outlaw or 
human without rights.

Anyway, now it's really enough. I feel like I've ended up in a 
kindergarten with a lot of people which seem to have become angry 
because I did say something against a small part of their toy and which 
do prefer to play the three monkeys and which like to turn my words in 
my mouth into something I never said.

Sorry to the serious people which do read this list, you aren't meant.
