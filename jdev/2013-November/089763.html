I guess one of the issues is that XMPP, being federated, is far more complicated than the straightforward client-server of the web. I&#8217;m far from an expert on these things but some kind of certificate pinning would require some extra xmpp protocol would it not? Plain DNSSEC and DANE could be implemented today though so my view would be let&#8217;s make sure we&#8217;re using the best we can do today in imlement the silver standard, and then have a really good discussion about how to implement the gold standard (potentially certificate pinning, but even this has drawbacks).

For users that absolutely require secrecy then they can still use e2e encryption today.

Let&#8217;s implement what we already have standards for today as a good start, and then, once that&#8217;s implemented, we can look at the gold standard. Otherwise we risk delaying for no really good reason.
