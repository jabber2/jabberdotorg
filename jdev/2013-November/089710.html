</I>&gt;<i> You don&#8217;t care about security, you don&#8217;t want your communication to be secret&#8230; why are you even discussing this? You&#8217;re derailing this thread with misinformation and showing an unwillingness to change anything.

Sorry, people, do you all like to turn the words in my mouth into 
something I haven't said?

What a scarry list.

I nevery said I don't want that my communication is secret and I never 
said that I don't care about security. I just have said that I don't 
care if the communication I do through XMPP on my little server uses 
strong encryption. And no word about security.

And that doesn't mean that I don't care about my privacy, in fact a care 
a lot, I'm just not that silly to think that I could use XMPP for that 
whithout P2P encryption. That's a whole different thing than you want to 
imply.

Thanks for beeing that iniquitous.

Alexander Holler
