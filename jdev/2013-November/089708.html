Hi,
I might have misunderstood, but it seems that you are mostly against
draft-saintandre-xmpp-tls, rather than the points stated in this
manifesto, as it is only a manifesto. The manifesto only creates
requirements for people that sign it; the only requirement for
interoperability is that your server, to be compatible with the ones
that sign the manifesto, must support s2s encryption and a FS suite
(although I agree that allowing servers to *require* FS might be
a little strong).

On updating software/hardware, I think it is reasonable to assume that
anything that runs today is able to negociate TLSv1, which I consider
the baseline. The manifesto says that software that endorses it must
be able to negociate and prefer TLSv1.2; I consider that as *new
versions* of the software, on an up-to-date system. We can&#8217;t
realistically have every XMPP software bundling its own recent OpenSSL
because debian is stable.

As someone who runs his own XMPP service, I won&#8217;t ever have a &#8220;trusted
certificate&#8221; as a matter of principles, but I don&#8217;t see what would impact
me in other people signing this manifesto.

In my opinion, the manifesto is, for software, to kill SSLv2 and SSLv3
for good, and provide security sane defaults that can be changed. For
deployments, it&#8217;s more about upgrading the network, which security
properties haven&#8217;t been updated in a while, and to provide a set of
quality guarantees for a large number of public XMPP services.

A bit of off-topic, but out of curiosity, what would you use for a
communication you want to keep secret? I think that&#8217;s precisely what
a personal server is for.

Regards
