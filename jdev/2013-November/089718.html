I have not read this thread, because I am very busy at the IETF
meeting this week in Vancouver.

The Jabber/XMPP community has always had a culture of being friendly
and respectful of others (yes, we've also had some flame wars during
that time!). I request that we keep it that way.

Security is hard. There are legitimate choices to be made here, we
don't want to fracture our network, and there are many problems yet to
be solved (opportunistic encryption with TLS + Dialback, DNSSEC/DANE,
POSH, key pinning, certificate transparency, peer-to-peer trust among
servers without so-called trusted third parties, end-to-end
encryption, potentially even things like cover traffic and mix
networks). I for one don't claim to have all the answers. As a
community, we need to figure out where we want to go. I agree with
Marco that our network currently provides a lower level of security
than we are capable of offering today -- a level that I think does not
show appropriate respect for those who use our services. IMHO we have
a responsibility to do better, and that's why I published the manifesto.
