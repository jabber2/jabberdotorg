There is no difference. I know of a lot of &quot;production&quot; environments 
which still do use much older systems. E.g. I've already mentioned SLES 
and RHEL.

&quot;up to date&quot; is the keyword here. E.g. squeeze is still supported but 
it's openssl doesn't support TLSv1.2. And even if it would be EOL, I 
would like it, if I would have the freedom to choose myself, when I stop 
using it.

Some people just don't want to buy a new phone every year. And there are 
many legitimate reasons to refuse upgrading a phone, pc or whatever to 
the latest available software versions.

&gt;<i> Your server is surely in production, isn't it?
</I> &gt;
 &gt; Production means &quot;deployed for everyday use&quot;, in my mind.
 &gt;

Sure, therefor I'm here and speak against the requirement for TLSv1.2. 
The manifesto sounds like it might be a good idea to enforce that 
requirement on the S2S too, and that clearly isn't what should be done 
in my opinion.

I now could start to talk about the questionable requirement for 
&quot;trusted&quot; certificates (whatever that should be) or DNSSEC (which I see 
as a red button in the hand of a foreign, not that friendly, government, 
which for sure doesn't care about me), but I think it's better not to 
start such a discussion here.

I already seem to be pretty alone with letting the user choose  what he 
thinks he needs (I'm pretty in support of encouraging strong encryption, 
just not of _requiring_ it, at least not now).

&gt;<i> In any case, the attack vector here isn't that the NSA or GCHQ are
</I>&gt;<i> targetting you specifically. It's that they're targetting everyone, and
</I>&gt;<i> keeping that information around in case they need it later. This is why
</I>&gt;<i> we're suggesting encrypting everything, and with PFS, so that it's
</I>&gt;<i> worthless, and so they *need* to target you to snoop on you.
</I>
I know that all that (don't misinterpret the fact that I've forgotten 
that DH is supported by openssl since a long time), but I wouldn't use 
my server for any communication I want to be secret. At least not for 
stuff which isn't p2p encrypted (and XMPP usually is not).

Alexander Holler
