Hello,

I think it is important to make a distinction between suggested key pinning
and automatic key pinning. Suggested key pinning is what is proposed in [1]
and [2], automatic key pinning is what SSH uses.

Automatic key pinning works for SSH, because private keys are rarely changed
and people are more tech-savy than average XMPP users. If you start doing this
for XMPP, you'll see a lot of false positives. I doubt you can convince a
large part of the network to start using self-signed certificates valid for a
long time. Every time a user who doesn't understand the security implications
removes a pin, the security of the system is weakened because it makes MitM
attacks easier. The manifesto requires software to be able to inform users
when a certificate changes and I think this is the right approach to automatic
pinning.

Suggested key pinning would be the server telling the client &quot;please verify
one of these keys is used on your next connection: xxx, yyy&quot;. I'm greatly in
favor of this, and for those who might have missed it, I wrote a proposal on
how to apply it to XMPP on [3].

But right now this is just a proposal, with no working code to go with it.
With the manifesto going in affect on May 19 2014, I think making this a
required part of it would be too soon.
