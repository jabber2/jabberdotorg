&gt;<i> &quot;up to date&quot; is the keyword here. E.g. squeeze is still supported but it's openssl doesn't support TLSv1.2. And even if it would be EOL, I would like it, if I would have the freedom to choose myself, when I stop using it.
</I>
And some people might still want to use SSLv2 with DES, but it&#8217;s really not a good reason to keep using protocols with known vulnerabilities. If we were adjusting the requirements so even the laziest admins wouldn&#8217;t need to do anything, then it would hardly be a manifesto.

&gt;<i> Sure, therefor I'm here and speak against the requirement for TLSv1.2. The manifesto sounds like it might be a good idea to enforce that requirement on the S2S too, and that clearly isn't what should be done in my opinion.
</I>
There&#8217;s no such requirement in the manifesto and I know many people would be against doing that right now.

&gt;<i> I already seem to be pretty alone with letting the user choose  what he thinks he needs (I'm pretty in support of encouraging strong encryption, just not of _requiring_ it, at least not now).
</I>
There&#8217;s also no requirement for &#8220;strong&#8221; encryption, unless you count the MTI cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA from 6120 or the requirement to prefer forward-secret cipher suites.

&gt;&gt;<i> In any case, the attack vector here isn't that the NSA or GCHQ are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> targetting you specifically. It's that they're targetting everyone, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keeping that information around in case they need it later. This is why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we're suggesting encrypting everything, and with PFS, so that it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worthless, and so they *need* to target you to snoop on you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know that all that (don't misinterpret the fact that I've forgotten that DH is supported by openssl since a long time), but I wouldn't use my server for any communication I want to be secret. At least not for stuff which isn't p2p encrypted (and XMPP usually is not).
</I>
You don&#8217;t care about security, you don&#8217;t want your communication to be secret&#8230; why are you even discussing this? You&#8217;re derailing this thread with misinformation and showing an unwillingness to change anything.
