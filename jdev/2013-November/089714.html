</I>That's legit to not care, but ultimately the manifesto is about caring...

</I>Good, but using weak security &quot;channel&quot; wise would mean leaving still 
only one layer and no matter what the main encryption's semantic is that 
it's a reversible process. Perhaps, the &quot;(stronger) more the merrier&quot;.

... I'll avoid commenting the last message, except that as long as your 
server is located in country where there's a state of right and not some 
dictatorship you should not worry about your private keys (because 
that's the *kind* of keys needed after all), or another property of 
yours, for that mean, being handed to someone else &quot;without you noticing&quot;.
Also I ultimately prefer to look at facts, rather than what &quot;seems to 
be&quot; :).
