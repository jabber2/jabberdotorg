<PRE>Hi,

Definition:

- POST-Prism means the time after PRISM. What we know now. It does not
imply that PRISM ever carried out a DNSSEC or DNS attack. Sorry if this was
not clear.

- Khomeini: Sorry, you are right. He is dead. Use Khamenei. Sorry for the
typo. Makes zero difference.

Let's stay technical.

Assuming the DNS was used then the user could be tricked in connecting to
the wrong IP address of the jabber server. Yet the security is not
compromised because the TLS connection will fail (assuming the certificate
is pinned).

The attacker can prevent the user from connecting to the jabber server but
the attacker can not read the data/chat/messages of the user. What we
should focus on is that the data/chat/messages stay confidential. Pinning
does this.

The pinning (without DNSSEC) is open to attack on the first connect. SSH is
vulnerable the same way. SSH works on the same model (pinning). See my
other email why the 'first connect' scenario is not practical for an
attacker.

(and if you want to fix this then you can use DNSSEC with PINNING).

On the other hand just using DNSSEC requires the user to trust at least 3
different keys from 3 different entities that have 3 totally different
geopolitical interests. What can possible go wrong...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. A black person wishing to sit in the front row of a bus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5 ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/SARCASM&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> Typically, sarcasm is used to posit something that is clearly the opposite

Sorry if this was not obvious.
