<PRE>Dear member of the XMPP Community,

Like every year, we are grateful that the XMPP Standards Foundation had 
several sponsors in 2019. These contributions allow the XSF to pursue 
its mission &lt;<A HREF="https://xmpp.org/about/xsf/mission">https://xmpp.org/about/xsf/mission</A>&gt; to build an open 
infrastructure for real-time communication based on XMPP. We would like 
to kindly ask you to consider if your organization could sponsor the XSF 
in 2020.

Sponsorship is the primary source of funds for the XSF. Besides costs 
for running the XSF as a corporation and its (online) infrastructure, we 
spend these funds on participating in events, as well as organizing 
events like the XMPP Summit, FOSDEM, and meetups. This includes 
purchasing and transporting promotion materials (posters, stickers, 
clothing), as well as lunch at the Summit.

Your contribution also enables the XSF to sponsor travel for people, so 
they can attend such events. An example is inviting former students of 
Google's Summer of Code, as an encouragement to remain active in our 
community. For this year, we are looking into funding work on necessary 
maintenance on our infrastructure.

If you would like to be an XSF sponsor in 2020, please let us know at 
<A HREF="https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">sponsors at xmpp.org</A> &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">sponsors at xmpp.org</A>&gt;, along with your desired 
sponsorship level and contact details. We will then send you an invoice 
to complete the application. More information on sponsorship levels and 
benefits can be found on the sponsorship page on our website 
&lt;<A HREF="https://xmpp.org/community/sponsorship.html">https://xmpp.org/community/sponsorship.html</A>&gt;. Should you have any 
questions, please let us know at that same e-mail address.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards,

Ralph Meijer
Chair of the XMPP Standards Foundation
