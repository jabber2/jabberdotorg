<PRE>I'm trying to determine whether XEP-0004 can be used by a bot to send  
data forms to a client. I've tried a couple of things and none have  
resulted in forms, but i don't know whether that is because of my lack  
of understanding of the spec or lack of support in my clients (pidgin  
and Adium)

Here's what i've tried:

- include a form via &lt;x/&gt; inside a message sent from the bot to the  
client. Client gets the message and shows the body in chat, but does  
not show the form
- send an &lt;iq/&gt; of type &quot;result&quot; for some imaginary command with &lt;x/&gt;  
inside the &lt;command/&gt;, also did not result in a form
- tried using a &lt;message/&gt; with a &lt;query/&gt; element advertising my  
imaginary command, hoping that the command would then be callable by  
pidgin so that i could properly respond with a form in response to the  
command request. I know pidgin and Adium discover commands at the  
server level so that admins can execute various commands, but i can't  
determine whether they support commands at the jid level. Advertising  
the command did not result in a callable option in the dropdown.

Basically is there a way to push a form to a client or if not, how  
would a client request a form from another client?

thanks
arne
