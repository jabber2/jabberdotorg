Sure, presentations and demos are quite welcome. Our format has been a
bit different for each XMPP Summit. However, the first 4 were quite
small (~15 people). At the XMPP Summit 2 months ago we had 45 people! So
I think we need to plan a bit more for such a large group. For the XMPP
Summit at FOSDEM 2009 I think it would be good to have more hackfests
among smaller groups (e.g., some client developers working together on
Jingle, some other client and library developers working on end-to-end
encryption, some server developers working to test TLS+SASL, etc.). But
we would still have lots of time for presentations and discussion.

&gt;&gt;<i> Besides that, the FOSDEM team welcomes suggestions for speakers for the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speaker, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the speaker should point out what is going on here: Jabber going
</I>&gt;<i> Social and the FSF seeking for a Skype replacement are good starting
</I>&gt;<i> points.
</I>
Sure. I gave a keynote at FOSDEM 2007 on XMPP security, so I don't know
if they'd want me back, but I'm always happy to give a talk about our
technologies.
