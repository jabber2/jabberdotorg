I was the one who added XMPP forms support to libpurple (and thus,  
pidgin and Adium), but I've never tested push-type forms. This may  
simply be a limitation of my implementation, since I didn't consider  
this to be important (because I didn't have any program that was able  
to do this). Should be easy to fix though.

</I>
Forms generated as a reply to ad-hoc commands are supported in  
libpurple. However, pidgin doesn't support the discovery browser (too  
XMPP-specific), so I guess only Adium can actually send ad-hoc  
commands via the browser (you can open it in the account's menu from  
the file menu).
