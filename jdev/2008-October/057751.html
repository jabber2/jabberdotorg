Stupid question from someone who only knows &quot;normal&quot; conferences: What
happens in the XMPP room? I read about inter-opts and discussions. How
does this work? There are so many interessting things going on, are
there also some small presentations and demos? I would love to see
Jabber going Social in action and my playing using XMPP as UPnP++ may
also be interessting for some people.

Maybe the speaker should point out what is going on here: Jabber going
Social and the FSF seeking for a Skype replacement are good starting
points.
