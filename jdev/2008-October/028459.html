Be sure that I keep my eyes open for this and apply for a devroom and
booth at the first chance, as usual.

Last year there were as many rooms as the years before, but the
selection wasn't on first come, first serve anymore. With twice as many
applying projects as there are rooms, we didn't make it this year. I
hope that with the hightened attention to XMPP we will get a room this
year.

Besides that, the FOSDEM team welcomes suggestions for speakers for the
general tracks via a form on the site. We might want to propose a
speaker, too.
