<PRE>&gt;<i>The whole connecting/disconnecting thing was tested quite a bit over 
</I>&gt;<i>the last month or so that late betas and release candidates were 
</I>&gt;<i>powering jabber.org.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is there any way you can give more information, for instance - 
</I>&gt;<i>machine information (processor, os, version of os, and installation 
</I>&gt;<i>quirks and if 1.0 was installed on this machine before), plus some 
</I>&gt;<i>debug output? (jabberd -D)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am using a PIII 450 running linux mandrake 7. As I  mentioned I had 
the prior version running before without any problems. Although I did 
not remove prior installation components, I was able to compile and 
install libxode 1.2, libjabber 1.2, and jabber 1.2 without 
difficulty. I can always connect initially but after the second or 
third disconnect and reconnect the server will crash with a 
segmentation fault message and core dump. I have run with the D flag 
and one of the last things it recorded is something like:

deliver.c:472 DELIVER 1:update.jabber.org &lt;xdb type='result' 
to='update.jabber.org' 
from='<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">959967039 at update.jabber.org</A>/jabber:iq:auth' id='14'/&gt;

it also has displayed some other lines afterwards though not 
consistently. Last time the next lines were something like:

deliver.c:344 delivering to instance 's2s'
base_load.c:167 exb_results checking xdb packet &lt;xdb t

I also sometimes get a warning when I run it without D that 
(update.jabber.org):xdb_file failed to open file 
./spool/update.jabber.org/959967039.xml: No such file or directory.

I suspect that I must have something screwed up in my jabber.xml or 
otherwise. I took the ISP template and modified it for my usage.

Another strange thing is that when I start jabberd from a console 
window using the ./jabberd/jabberd &amp; command it starts two instances 
of jabberd. One is killed off immediately if I close the console 
window. When an attempt is made to connect the other is then killed 
off. If I don't close the window, I get the symptoms I originally 
described. Obviously I f'd up something with my installatoin but I am 
not exactly sure what I did and how to fix it. Thanks for any 
additional advice.
