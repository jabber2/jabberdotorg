<PRE>Here's a message I sent to a manager after I installed Jabber client/server.
He made the mistake of calling it &quot;unsupported software&quot;.  Anyone have
comments/additions?

Subject: &quot;Unsupported&quot; software...


Here's some additional information about &quot;unsupported&quot; software -- otherwise
known as &quot;open source&quot; or &quot;free&quot; software.

Support for open source software is often superior to that of commercial
software.

If I find -- or create &lt;g&gt; -- a problem that I can't fix, I post a message
to a mailing list and within the hour (usually on the order of a few
minutes) have an answer -- possibly from the author of the package.

Commercial packages -- on the other hand -- shield their developers from the
hordes of users so that they can further develop the product.  Support is
delegated/relegated to a &quot;support desk/team&quot; who usually do not have the
resources (access to the source) that the open-source community does.

Open-source software tends to be better-written than its counterpart, for
two reasons:

1.  The software is visible to all; programmers write more carefully when
they know it's going to be reviewed by the community; and
2.  These programs are a &quot;labor of love&quot; -- the practice of releasing
programs with known bugs or reduced functionality to meet revenue-induced
deadlines simply doesn't exist.

There.  That's my $0.02.
