FWIW I agree with this very much; if Jabber is to survive, my feeling is
that the knowledge has to spread a little; as many people have pointed out,
it's mostly due to a lack of (human) resource; I think that some sort of
forum (Wiki-style?) would be great; I think there are different levels of
Jabber person:

- core coders
- transport coders
- integrators
- users
- tinkerers

and all have something to contribute.

As dlb says, there _is_ a lot of info to be gained from trawling through the
JDEV and #jabber archives (where d'you think I got the info for
<A HREF="http://www.pipetree.com/jabber/groupchat-1.2.html">http://www.pipetree.com/jabber/groupchat-1.2.html</A> from? ;-) but perhaps
something more akin to a thought bucket - easy to contribute snippets to -
might go down well. I don't know anything about Wiki but if I can help I
will.
