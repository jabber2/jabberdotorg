<PRE>I agree with everything that Keith stated except for the idea of multiple 
registrations to a transport.  The problem with this is best laid out in this
scenario:

- User LadyInRed has been constantly harassed by user ILoveU and has finally 
  decided to put them on a deny list.
- ILoveU starts to realize he's not getting responses and can no longer see
  LadyInRed's presence, so he creates a new user IHateU
- IHateU is now used to monitor LadyInRed, but ILoveU is still used as the
  primary to try and chat with her every so often (maybe they get lucky and
  actually get to chat once in a while when he's not an ass).
- So IHateU/ILoveU finds Jabber and begins using it, he sets up a transport to
  have both of those users sign on, and use his full rosters from the server
  and the works.
- So IHateU/ILoveU then sends a message to LadyInRed through the transport.
  How can the transport make the routing decision about who to route this
  message through?  IHateU or ILoveU?  One of these could lead to a very bad
  situation, one just gets rejected.

Hope you see the problem.
