 &gt; Are you planning to port/maintain MIO back on  the 1.2.x series,
 &gt; or maintain separate branches for MIO and non-MIO transports (for bug
 &gt; fixes) ? I'm very nervous that many people have barely been able to get
 &gt; the server working (much fewer the transports), and you are now moving
 &gt; on to a new incompatible series.

Exactly!

I fear however, the answer may again be a resounding &quot;No, we don't care
about you.&quot;  Those choosing to run the stable server got royally screwed
with the release of the 1.2 server.  As soon as 1.2 was released, the
support just-plain-stopped *for* server 1.2 apparently, and moved on to
(unstable) 1.3 (as ludicrous as that seems.)

Back on November 14th, I said:
 
 &gt; How about those us us who run stable, not cvs versions of things?
 &gt; When will there be a version which will work with the (just-released)
 &gt; stable server 1.2?  (We waited long enough for 1.2 to be released,
 &gt; this wait for a compatible irctrans is an additional aggravation.
 &gt; Please don't tell us we need to wait for server 1.4.)

And he replied:

 &gt; and to me, Server developemnt comes first, above all else..You all may
 &gt; feel differently, but that's my take... =]

I guess there's &quot;no time&quot; to care about those of us attempting to run
stable server 1.2.  The Jabber project is apparently only targeted
toward those who are among the &quot;eleet&quot; 1.3 development team, at least
that is the impression conveyed.  (I'll believe otherwise when I see an
irctrans that works with stable server 1.2.)

I would hope that this attitude of nose-thumbing toward those running
1.2 would have changed by now.  Unfortunately, we see otherwise, even in
the very subject line of this thread.  Transport authors (who certainly
have not effectively completed the task of getting their transports to
work well with 1.2) are being advised to focus their attention upon the
incompatible 1.3 server!  Where is the sense in that?

The overall message seems clear, the users (and server operators) don't
matter, only the devel team.

Does anyone care to conjecture whether 1.4 will end up effectively
orphaned in favor of 1.5, as quickly as 1.2 was considered obsoleted?

&quot;1.2 -- the release orphaned before it learned to crawl&quot;  (Great slogan!)

It certainly leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
