<PRE>Hi All,

I have received some requests asking how my setup on TRU64 turned out.  Yes,
I have a server running, and I have installed the groupchat with it as well.
I had to make some modifications to the compile and linking commands to get
it to work.
1.	I added &#147;#pragma nomember_alignment&#148; to the top of every header file from
both Jabber downloads and the adns and pth downloads.
2.	I added &#147;-O0&#148; to the compile commands so there was no optimization.
3.	I had to add a lot of the object files to the jabber-1.2 links.  I am not
claiming that it is running perfectly, I have more testing to do, but I am
able to chat most of the time and create a groupchat.

I also am wondering if the first 2 steps are really a fix or just a
workaround for TRU64.  I will need to look at it more closely.

Oh yeah, another point of interest is that I ended up using gcc because the
DEC C compiler was giving me a lot of warnings and a few errors.

If you have more questions fire away and I&#146;ll answer them as I can.  There
were probably a few other miscellaneous changes that I had to make that I
haven&#146;t put in this message so let me know if have a problem and I may
remember having to fix that on my system as well.
