<PRE>&gt;<i>Hi Mark,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Um, that weather-transport is a dormant project, I think. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm currently putting together a short doc on the MIO (Managed
</I>&gt;<i>Input/Output) API for communications between transports and jabberd (the
</I>&gt;<i>core server) in Jabber 1.4. However, I'm sure it won't answer all your
</I>&gt;<i>questions -- there is a lot to be learned from the core server
</I>&gt;<i>developers that I don't think I'll be able to capture in this doc, at
</I>&gt;<i>least not in the first draft. I'll let you know when the doc is done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>See also this recent post by Keith Minkler (a.k.a. TSBandit) on JDEV:

Thanks Peter. I look forward to reading your document.

I had read Keith's message and all the follow ups but before I can 
really appreciate all of the items that affect the actual Transport 
Server development, I am trying to understand what other changes or 
components one would need within Jabber in order to support a given 
Transport Server, if any?

1 - If I wanted to build a Transport that would allow me to access an 
information source such as Usenet News, what else is needed besides 
the actual Transport Server?

2 - I get confused by service and server. Is there always a service 
that corresponds to the transport implementing that service? Is there 
a core component that plays the role of the service?

3 - And if I want UseNet News to be a service that a user can 
subscribe to, what do I need to do? Provided that jabber is 
configured to know about the UseNet Transport and requests have a 
Usenet service id, will messages simply get routed to that transport 
with no changes or additions required in the core?

I know the details of transport development and integration within 
Jabber are second nature to those doing the development but to those 
of us trying to get a handle on the whole process its a challenge. 
Any quick sketch of the transport development and integration process 
sure would be helpful. I am not looking for the details but rather 
the big picture. I can dig out the details once I have an 
understanding of how things are supposed to work.

thanks
