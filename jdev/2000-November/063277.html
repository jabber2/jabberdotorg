<PRE>This is exactly what Jabber was designed for, it just happens that IM is the
first (and easiest) case example.  As St. Peter mentioned PocketLinux is using
Jabber for just about everything it does, very neat!  I also know of help desk
management solutions, and system monitoring solutions built on Jabber's ideas.
I would expect to see a lot more coming out soon along lines other than your
standard &quot;IM&quot; fair.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;xml stream&quot; made me thing of jabber, and that is how i thought of it for

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> users can communicate directly peer-to-peer but will often find each other

</I>&gt;<i> phones and whatever other gadgets people have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so my question is, is jabber being used for anything like this?  in the
</I>&gt;<i> backend, to provide the communications framework for an application?  how
</I>&gt;<i> suited is jabber to this sort of role?  in my shallow analysis of the
</I>&gt;<i> space it would seem like jabber would be very suited to this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> any thoughts, feedback?
