I'd like to encourage is consideration for light weight clients.  Things 
like flash which can make secure http connections (although the 
XMLSocket object can't be a secure link I don't think).  Another example 
might be javascript clients, both don't have existing libraries for 
strong security/encryption.

If i could retrieve a random string by a secure url request and then use 
that to mask my password then i'd be 1000 times happier than i am right 
now.  (Yeah, i could write it myself)  But the use of standard browser 
infrastructure would solve many security problems i think.

I'm confident that my comments are accurate but i'm not sure.

Regards, Oliver.
