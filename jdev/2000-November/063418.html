<PRE>Hi Keith

&gt;<i>  One other thing to point out... step 7 is not needed with the way you
</I>setup the config... that jabberd:sockets issue is only a problem when you
are linking together jabberd's with exec and stdout, however, that should
probably still be noted, since it was a really dumb bug in the 1.2RC
server..
&gt;<i>
</I>
Ah - good point. In fact, I had originally followed the instructions in the
conferencing module README and got a 2nd server spawned, which is where this
was necessary, I guess; but after seeing a message (looks... ah, from you in
fact ;-) on JDEV about not having to do this, I went the simple way and left
the change in. I'll put a footnote in the howto, or something.

&gt;<i>  also.. step 9 is not needed with a component that is loaded into jabberd
</I>(a .so) becuase it never has to make a socket connection.. internally,
[...]
&gt;<i>
</I>
Aha - I learn something new again ;-) Thanks. I'll put in another note about
this too.

&gt;<i>  Other than those two minor points, this is a great piece of
</I>documentation!  Is this going to be on this site for awhile?  we are going
to be trying to set something up on docs.jabber.org probably PHP based that
pulls our existing sgml documentation from CVS, and it would work similar to
php.net's documentation... We have a guy that is willing and able to put
this all together, and your documentation would be a super addition to this
documentation set on docs.jabber.org.
&gt;<i>
</I>
Well sure, you're welcome to it; I've already mentioned to Eliot that I'm
going to have a look at DocBook, and will probably try to use it for my next
'article'. I intend for <A HREF="http://www.pipetree.com/jabber/">http://www.pipetree.com/jabber/</A> to stay around for a
while in any case.

If you want to put the content on the jabber* sites then by all means let's
do something; I have a traffic limit on pipetree.com at the moment (bargain
basement colo).

cheers
dj
