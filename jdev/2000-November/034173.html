<PRE>Hi Mark,

Um, that weather-transport is a dormant project, I think. :)

I'm currently putting together a short doc on the MIO (Managed
Input/Output) API for communications between transports and jabberd (the
core server) in Jabber 1.4. However, I'm sure it won't answer all your
questions -- there is a lot to be learned from the core server
developers that I don't think I'll be able to capture in this doc, at
least not in the first draft. I'll let you know when the doc is done.

See also this recent post by Keith Minkler (a.k.a. TSBandit) on JDEV:

</I>&gt;<i> destined for the information service provider and then hands those
</I>&gt;<i> off to the transport?  How does a client discover which services are
</I>&gt;<i> available in order for that client to be able to subscribe to that
</I>&gt;<i> service (i.e. have the service appear in my roster as someone I can
</I>&gt;<i> interact with)? Is there a discovery mechanism or do you just need to
</I>&gt;<i> know the &quot;address&quot; of the destination and it just happens to be a
</I>&gt;<i> service provider? Does one treat services just like any other user
</I>&gt;<i> that you want to add to your roster?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It sure looks like all the infrastructure is in place (or at least
</I>&gt;<i> appears to be given my untrained jabber eyes) and that what I really
</I>&gt;<i> need is just some guidance. The details of any given piece can be
</I>&gt;<i> learned, for now I want to get a handle on the large chunks, their
</I>&gt;<i> roles and responsibilities.
