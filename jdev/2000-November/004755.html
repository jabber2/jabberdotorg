<PRE>At one point it was determined by Keith and I that FreeBSD handles its
sockets in a different manner then Linux. I, not being that uber of a
FreeBSD hacker does not know the difference. The machine we were testing it
on was FreeBSD 3.4 I have since moved to FreeBSD 4.1.1 hoping this will
solve the problem since there was a major overhaul between the 3.x and 4.x
series. I regret to say that the same symptoms are occuring. A user can
login but after they login they cannot receive their roster and sticks on
this...


RCVD: &lt;iq type='result' id='0'/&gt;
SENT: &lt;iq type='get' id='1'&gt;&lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:agents'/&gt;&lt;/iq&gt;

Nothing else is sent to or from the server. The Jabber server 1.2 and latest
CVS as of today thinks everything is happy and is chugging along like it
thinks it should. There are no error messages. But the client freezes on
this, and sometimes goes as far as coring. I have tested this with clients
Gabber 0.7.0, Gabber CVS, latest versoin of Jarl, and latest version of
WinJab. To no avail. I can login just fine with all these clients to
jabber.org but not to my own server. The only thing I have changed from the
base Jabber 1.2 configuration is the hostname and I have created the
spool/{hostname} like it says in the documentation.

I would really appreciate any help anyone may be able to offer. I use Jabber
in a commercial enviroment and this greatly limits me in my adovocacy of
Jabber since I can no longer run the now working transports, or be subject
to the improvements of 1.2.
