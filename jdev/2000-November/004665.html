<PRE>As some of you may know I'm a huge fan of strong security options in any 
software that I use.  Jabber is definately software I use ;-] and it needs 
more improvements in it's security foundings it already has.  Over the next few
weeks I'm going to be taking a long hard look at many of the security options
that we have available to us.  I would like to ask for any comments, suggestions
or ideas that anyone has, so I can include these in my initial write up of where
we stand.  After this writeup (I'll probably try and do this by the end of the
week), I plan to start implementing as many of the features as I possibly can.
I'm completely serious on this issue, and I'm willing to entertain most any
idea, even the most widely debated end to end encryption (it's hard, but I have
some ideas for it).  So I'm throwing myself into the deep end, and hoping I 
don't drown =)
