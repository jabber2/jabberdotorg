</I>&gt;<i> /Documentation is a very weak point of ours,  I think this is becuase 
</I>&gt;<i> our server developers, who are among the few that know how it works, 
</I>&gt;<i> are coding, not writing documentation, becuase that is what we are 
</I>&gt;<i> good at.../
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> would it be useful to create a publically accessible development/ 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation log in which server &amp; transport developers, as well as 
</I>&gt;<i> people who are gaining experience in implementing jabber servers, 
</I>&gt;<i> could post information and advice on an ad hoc basic ?  A simple 
</I>&gt;<i> indexing system could be imposed under which these entries we're 
</I>&gt;<i> compiled for assimilation to a proper documentation system.  You could 
</I>&gt;<i> think of it as a CVS for documentation.  The assimilation process 
</I>&gt;<i> would be overseen by a maintainer(s) on an ongoing basis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know that the TCL community has had some success with this sort of 
</I>&gt;<i> thing (eg. TCL's Wiki).  It wouldn't render a coherent body of 
</I>&gt;<i> materials on its own, but would be used to feed a formal documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> effort.  Simply combing through jdev posts, combining and editting 
</I>&gt;<i> these, might be a good start.  As I've been familiarizing myself with 
</I>&gt;<i> jabber I've realized that there's actually a significant amount of 
</I>&gt;<i> valuable information available, you've just got to hunt around for it 
</I>&gt;<i> + the jdev community is first rate.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there's any interest in this I'll certainly help out.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty, as you've acknowledged, is that jabber's matured to a 
</I>&gt;<i> point that it's very difficult to contribute to the effort without an 
</I>&gt;<i> insider's knowledge of the architecture.  A wiki/cvs style system 
</I>&gt;<i> could be exploited to address this issue without requiring the doc 
</I>&gt;<i> team to start cold. Critical deficits in documentation would be 
</I>&gt;<i> addressed as they arise ( I know, right now everything is critical ) 
</I>&gt;<i> while steadily building a more comprehensive doc system going forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ??
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Just my $0.02 ... the php.net annotated manual has always appealed to me.
