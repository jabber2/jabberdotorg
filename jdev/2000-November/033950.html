<PRE>Well, you could buy the commercial Jabber server when it's released by
Jabber.com and make you AND your boss happy by getting a commercially
supported product developed under open source methodology.  If you want to
stick with the Jabber.org server, though, you should know that Jabber.com
does offer technical support programs for the open source versions of the
Jabber server.

Either way, a beautiful new copy of The Cathedral and the Bazaar would make
a nice holiday gift for anyone, bosses included.  ESPECIALLY bosses
included.

 

Todd.

Subject: [JDEV] FW: &quot;Unsupported&quot; software...



Here's a message I sent to a manager after I installed Jabber client/server.
He made the mistake of calling it &quot;unsupported software&quot;.  Anyone have
comments/additions?

Subject: &quot;Unsupported&quot; software... 


Here's some additional information about &quot;unsupported&quot; software -- otherwise
known as &quot;open source&quot; or &quot;free&quot; software. 

Support for open source software is often superior to that of commercial
software. 

If I find -- or create &lt;g&gt; -- a problem that I can't fix, I post a message
to a mailing list and within the hour (usually on the order of a few
minutes) have an answer -- possibly from the author of the package.

Commercial packages -- on the other hand -- shield their developers from the
hordes of users so that they can further develop the product.  Support is
delegated/relegated to a &quot;support desk/team&quot; who usually do not have the
resources (access to the source) that the open-source community does.

Open-source software tends to be better-written than its counterpart, for
two reasons: 

1.  The software is visible to all; programmers write more carefully when
they know it's going to be reviewed by the community; and

2.  These programs are a &quot;labor of love&quot; -- the practice of releasing
programs with known bugs or reduced functionality to meet revenue-induced
deadlines simply doesn't exist.

There.  That's my $0.02.
