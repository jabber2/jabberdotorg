The problem is not at all the crypto algorithm. The problem is 
&quot;trusting&quot; a remote partner, and making sure a remote partner is 
&quot;valid&quot;.


This is a complicated topic, I wrote several mails to the JDEV ML 
about this topic, and also have talked in the past (and will talk in 
the future) with the Jabber core team about this.


I suggest to everyone who wants to talk about security with us to 
read &quot;Intro to Crypto&quot; by Philip Zimmerman (the inventor of PGP) 
which is available as text/html/pdf for free on the net.


Of course, this is not a problem if both sides of the communication 
&quot;know&quot; each other and have a shared key. But in 99% of time this is 
not the case. Thus, you have to relay on CAs (Certification Agencies) 
that you trust and that help you validate your &quot;partner&quot; with whom 
you want to communicate.


Again, read &quot;Intro to Crypto&quot; to understand better the problems of 
cryptography (and let me asure you one thing: it's simple to write a 
program using Rijndael/DES/RSA/TwoFish/Blowfish/IDEA/whatever that is 
perfectly *unsecure*!)
