You can happily run a server assuming DNS works. If DNS is invalid, it 
will not work. Why are you doing server-server communication if your 
host can't be resolved? How are replies expected to come in?

This is actually very good. Before people were very easily able to 
spoof, and could also easily send massive amounts of spam from an 
invalid address. Soon (not now, as 1.0 still exists and is for the time 
being supported), this won't work.

Clarify that last statement, please.
