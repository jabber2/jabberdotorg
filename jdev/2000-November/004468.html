<PRE>&gt;<i>I have the exact same problem.  I am running RedHat 7.0 on a 
</I>&gt;<i>P200MMX.  I too had 1.0 running fine.  I originally tried copying 
</I>&gt;<i>the user files over but then tried creating them from scratch and it 
</I>&gt;<i>didn't help.  I also rebuilt the libraries from the new tarballs.  I 
</I>&gt;<i>haven't tried running with -D yet but I did notice the same error 
</I>&gt;<i>about update.jabber.org.  The symptoms seem to be exactly the 
</I>&gt;<i>same... Also, when the server crashes, the user logging on is 
</I>&gt;<i>usually left with &quot;Receiving Roster&quot; in the debug window of WinJab 
</I>&gt;<i>so it may be in that area that it is crashing.

Julian,

Well at least we both know it isn't just our own personal screw ups ;-)

  As I recall I also had the receiving roster message in Winjab when 
it happened (in my Mac Jabbernaut I didn't recieve any obvious 
message it just failed with a numeric error code). Hopefully someone 
can assist us with figuring this out. If someone does provide me some 
ideas in the next day I will try them. Otherwise I will have to wait 
until I get back from vacation week after next.
