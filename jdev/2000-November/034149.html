Hi,

Thanks for some great doco's on your site :-) Liked the email notifier.

I found though that Gabber (as of 0.7.0, dunno about the 
soon-to-be-released-0.8.0) does not display the message when the notify 
script logs off jabber straight away. I have to put in a sleep(2) before the 
disconnect - then gabber shows the message sent by notify.pl

Question for the jabber people, would be possible for a script to log on with 
something like &quot;superuser&quot; capabilities, so that it can send a message on 
behalf of anyone as it would make transports very easy.

For example, when the email would come in, the notification script would look 
in our LDAP database to see which user sent the email (based on the From: 
header), it could then send the email (or a summary thereof) originating from 
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">thatuser at myjabberserver</A>/email .. ie the receiving end of an SMTP transport 
done really easily. The receiver, using a jabber client, could simply hit 
reply. (of course that needs another transport to support this). 

What is your opinion of this idea, and/or what would you suggest is the 
easiest way to implement this kind of behaviour (preferably without having to 
change jabber.xml and restarting the daemon constantly to test. This 
situation, where you only modify the notify.pl script would allow for very 
fast development of transports). Perl has modules for just about anything, 
now if it could blend in (ie send messages as a transport on behalf of a 
user, instead of having to be it's own user) there are lots of possibilities 
for rapid development of uses similar to notify.pl.

Any thoughts? :-)

Regards,
Dennis

PS DJ keep up the good work :)
