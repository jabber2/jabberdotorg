<PRE>Hi!

One thought that kept occuring to me, is that there isn't any documentation
on this future transport
interface. (that I can find)

Wouldn't it be prudent to sit down, before any more code is written, (and
hair pulled out), and write
a specification of what the new transport will be? A good document, written
by our current group of server
authors, and transport authors, can nail down issues before they become an
ugly mess. (like the 1.0 -&gt; 1.2 situation)
This way, transport authors will not be blindly writing something that they
know will have to be thrown
out in a month's time. They can write something for Jabberd 1.2/1.3 that
will require not nearly as much
modification for 1.4/2.0.

Many projects in the commercial world, have this step. Perhaps someone with
the .com/.org should start
this process. (even spending 2 weeks doing this might prevent a lot of
frustration of transport people)

MIO will provide a MUCH stabler platform for transports, since libetherx has
always been a bit flakey (maybe why it's been totally rewritten 4 or 7
times).. In my mind, 1.4 will be the &quot;real&quot; stable server, until 2.0... with
MIO, and pthreads in place, the API will not have a need to change until
after 2.0.  to me, it seems wastefull to put forth so much effort on trying
to get 1.0 transports to work stably on 1.2, when the interface is hackish,
since there is no MIO to glue them together solidly (if that's a real word).

Don't get me wrong, 1.2 Rocks, it's a HUGE step forward, but it's the first
step, not the last... 1.2 is completely d
