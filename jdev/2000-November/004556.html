<PRE>Hello,

I seem to be in a different timezone from most of you, since every morning 
when I check my mail I have dozens of mails and during the day I hardly get 
any :-) (I'm in Finland btw).

Anyway, based on previous discussions in this list I have experimented a 
little further, managed to compile jpolld (remove the -lsocket reference in 
the Makefile), replace the pthsock stuff in jabber.xml with an &lt;accept&gt; for 
jpolld, etc.

It seems to work, I can connect to jabberd and it seems to go through jpolld.

I also switched to kernel 2.4.0-test10, and I am testing on a P3-700 with 
128Mb RAM.

Impressions, jabberd used to always shoot up to 90+% CPU usage, now with 
jpolld it looks very neat, both CPU and memory resource usage for both are 
very low. 

However, there is still a limit at 1020 connections. Since I am using my own 
machine to run simulate3 on I am actually using double that number of 
sockets, so I don't think it's a tuning thing in my kernel. 

The error as reported by jpolld:
 [1] Adding conn at 1020
 [1] Max PFD: 1020
 [1] Connfd messed up
 [1] Error setting conn flags[1]
 ....
 [1] Poll failed: Invalid argument
 [1] Closing down thread
 base_accept: connection died on accepted socket

I think I compiled jabberd without pthsock at all, but there it still depends 
on the libs. I'll have a look at that again.


Regards,
Dennis
