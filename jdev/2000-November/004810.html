Documentation is a very weak point of ours,  I think this is becuase our server developers, who are
among the few that know how it works, are coding, not writing documentation, becuase that is what
we are good at...
~~~~~~~~~~~

would it be useful to create a publically accessible development/ implementation log in which server &amp;
transport developers, as well as people who are gaining experience in implementing jabber servers, could
post information and advice on an ad hoc basic ?  A simple indexing system could be imposed under
which these entries we're compiled for assimilation to a proper documentation system.  You could think of it as a CVS for documentation.  The assimilation process would be overseen by a maintainer(s) on an
ongoing basis.

I know that the TCL community has had some success with this sort of thing (eg. TCL's Wiki).  It wouldn't render a coherent body of materials on its own, but would be used to feed a formal documentation effort. Simply combing through jdev posts, combining and editting these, might be a good start.  As I've been familiarizing myself with jabber I've realized that there's actually a significant amount of valuable information available, you've just got to hunt around for it + the jdev community is first rate.


If there's any interest in this I'll certainly help out.  The difficulty, as you've acknowledged, is that jabber's
matured to a point that it's very difficult to contribute to the effort without an insider's knowledge of the
architecture.  A wiki/cvs style system could be exploited to address this issue without requiring the doc
team to start cold. Critical deficits in documentation would be addressed as they arise ( I know, right now everything is critical ) while steadily building a more comprehensive doc system going forward.
