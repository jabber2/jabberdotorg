<PRE>There are several points I don't quite understand, but:
-running your own server is only responsible for security if you do not trust your
own server operator.
-whether or not it is exploited, presence is supposed to be conditional per-user. No
client supports this in its current form, and I've been looking into a more powerful
way to support this functionality
-it does a forward, not reverse, DNS lookup. It does not care if you own the
IP address, just that you own the name.
-People faking other servers is just as bad or more of a security problem. For
instance, say I am stalking you. I know one of your friends is <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">somebody at jabber.org.</A>
Now if I can log in my 'server' as jabber.org, I can get your presence and status
anyways, even if I am explicitly off your subscription list.
-Running your own server isn't really a help at protecting presence if you are the
only one using it, and you turn it off when you leave.

</I>&gt;<i> (See above.)

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; This is actually very good. Before people were very easily able to

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; being supported), this won't work.
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  &gt; need the JUD code from Ryan Eatmon, and a working mySQL database.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; I thought that wasn't going to be available for some time now.  I agree
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; that many of us will not want to make all of our info available on the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; public Internet this way.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; Once again, privacy seems to be being attacked with changing versions.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Clarify that last statement, please.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, go back in the jabber-security archives, early.  There was an
</I>&gt;<i> extended discussion about privacy matters, trust, and how far presence
</I>&gt;<i> information could be protected.  I'll try to sum up some key points of
</I>&gt;<i> that discussion, but you would do better to read the original, in which
</I>&gt;<i> it was stated much more clearly than I anticipate doing now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider for a moment, a conversation between two end-users, Andy
</I>&gt;<i> and Betty.  For the benefit of discussion, Andy is a stalking victim,
</I>&gt;<i> and wishes to hide his presence from his stalker (who happens to be
</I>&gt;<i> the best friend of an employee in the IT department of his corporation,
</I>&gt;<i> or his home ISP, or whatever.)  Any number of scenarios will suffice,
</I>&gt;<i> but domestic violence and stalking seem to be issues that many can relate
</I>&gt;<i> with in terms of the importance of maintaining private information private.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm going to ignore the existence of Echelon and Carnivore and other
</I>&gt;<i> technologies at &quot;that level&quot; and pretend the only evilness in the world
</I>&gt;<i> comes at the hands of one or three &quot;bad technodweebs&quot; or so.  Oh that
</I>&gt;<i> life were actually so simple, eh? heh.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The discussion back then, was something as follows (VERY loosely
</I>&gt;<i> paraphrased:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - There should be control at the client level.
</I>&gt;<i>  - No, we want a thin client, we're fascinated with cell phones. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>  - But there should be control at the client level, and here are
</I>&gt;<i>     additional reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Tough, we're fascinated with putting Jabber on cell phones so that's
</I>&gt;<i>     that, the client remains thin, security is too &quot;fat.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have obviously grossly paraphrased, and attempted to inject a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> humour (don't be offended anyone developing for SMS.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bottom line however was that servers MUST be completely trusted,
</I>&gt;<i> that an untrusted-server-admin model was NOT to be accommodated, and that
</I>&gt;<i> if anyone cared about confidentiality they MUST run their own server.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;But that's okay, it's open source, just run a client and server both
</I>&gt;<i> on your Linux box.&quot;  (That last may be tongue in cheek on my part,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's closer to a direct quote than you may suspect.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Summary:
</I>&gt;<i>  TO ACHIEVE SECURITY / SAFETY / PRIVACY, RUN YOUR OWN SERVER, NOT JUST A CLIENT.
</I>&gt;<i> But again, &quot;servers are cheap, everyone can have one, this isn't an evil
</I>&gt;<i> centralized trust model&quot; etc., so no problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't entirely happy with this, I'll admit, but that's how it seemed
</I>&gt;<i> things were left.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  TO ACHIEVE SECURITY / SAFETY / PRIVACY, RUN YOUR OWN SERVER, NOT JUST A CLIENT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Back to our example, that leaves Andy and Betty, communicating thusly:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Andy at home, sending
</I>&gt;<i> ________________________                                 _______________
</I>&gt;<i> | Andy's               |                                 |Betty's      |
</I>&gt;<i> | Client --&gt; Andy's    |    &quot;eventually&quot; encrypted       |Server       |
</I>&gt;<i> |            Server    | --&gt; transmission across  -----&gt; |  |-&gt; Betty's|
</I>&gt;<i> |(&quot;localhost&quot; for Andy)|     the Internet, or similar    |      Client |
</I>&gt;<i> |______________________|     untrusted hostile network   |_____________|
</I>&gt;<i>                                                           Betty at home,
</I>&gt;<i>                                                              reading
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (BTW, it also bothered me that encryption and security were to be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;eventually added on&quot; rather than central to the design, but it was felt
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;easier&quot; that way.  (I'll refrain from pointing out the implications of
</I>&gt;<i> that design decision here.)  It's &quot;later&quot; now, so I'll ask: has end-to-end
</I>&gt;<i> encryption become part of standard practice yet?  Or is this still on the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;maybe some day&quot; list?)
</I>&gt;<i> Quote from the archive, answering someone's concern:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Whenever I talk to people within my company about using IM products they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get very worried about the fact that the messages are going out over the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'public Internet' in plain text (and that they may be logged or transported
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> You're exactly right. Even though Jabber has less security problems by
</I>&gt;<i> containing no routing (your home server sends a message directly to the
</I>&gt;<i> recipient's home server) we are still very much aware that IM would
</I>&gt;<i> benefit greatly from being encrypted end to end.
</I>&gt;<i> End quote.  (Ironic how this also mentions the expected norm is a
</I>&gt;<i> server-in-every-home.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  IF YOU WANT SECURITY / SAFETY / PRIVACY, RUN YOUR OWN SERVER, NOT JUST A CLIENT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the message we were given back then, and that's what my ASCII art
</I>&gt;<i> above attempts to illustrate.  I have no great talent in that regard,
</I>&gt;<i> so my apologies if it came out a jumbled mess, try to imagine what would
</I>&gt;<i> have been intended please.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also going to presume that Jabber is intended for the masses, not
</I>&gt;<i> just the hard-core geek with access to his/her own Internic registration,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.  Let's hope that's a valid assumption, and that neither Andy's nor
</I>&gt;<i> Betty's localhost above need to actually be sitting on a rack in some
</I>&gt;<i> colo facility two hops from a major backbone. ;-) (Ah, but we all can
</I>&gt;<i> dream, right? heh)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not intended as a personal attack David, so please don't take it
</I>&gt;<i> as such.  Perhaps, sitting at your .edu domain, you forget that many if
</I>&gt;<i> not most of &quot;us&quot; (the end-users out here) are restricted to dialup access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the above scenario, Andy has a dhs.org address, and Betty has a
</I>&gt;<i> dyndns.com address.  Or perhaps one uses dhis.com and one dhis.org,
</I>&gt;<i> or ddt.org, or any of the other myriad services for DYNAMIC addressing
</I>&gt;<i> available for us &lt;cough&gt; &quot;lowly&quot; dialup end-users out here among the
</I>&gt;<i> great unwashed of the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or yes, even overdue.ompages.com, as I do.  You asked:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; will not work. Why are you doing server-server communication if your
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; host can't be resolved? How are replies expected to come in?
</I>&gt;<i> The answer to the first part, why server-server, is detailed above.
</I>&gt;<i>  IF YOU WANT SECURITY / SAFETY / PRIVACY, RUN YOUR OWN SERVERS.
</I>&gt;<i> (I didn't like it then, but accepted it for the time being, fearing
</I>&gt;<i> this day would come when developers FORGOT that &quot;everyone should run
</I>&gt;<i> their own server&quot; was the accepted security mantra.)
</I>&gt;<i> And the answer to the second part was also addressed above, albeit
</I>&gt;<i> briefly:
</I>&gt;<i> : &gt; Delivered-To: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">lazarus at overdue.ompages.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> :   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</I>&gt;<i> :   (Remember this, I did get it, that's relevant below.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you do a reverse lookup on that domain, it will undoubtably NOT return
</I>&gt;<i> to something owned by ompages.com.  Frankly, the IP you get at the time
</I>&gt;<i> you read this email will probably not be the same as it is at the moment
</I>&gt;<i> I type this.  Nor is it the same ISP as it was yesterday, when I was in a
</I>&gt;<i> different city and used a different provider.  The domain is this box, and
</I>&gt;<i> this box does indeed travel from state to state, rather often actually.
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't utilize the same carriers, the same ISPs.  &quot;Not everyone has
</I>&gt;<i> a static IP, or even a static situation, as you do there.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is my point David, not intended as a personal attack, just a reminder
</I>&gt;<i> that it might be easy to forget that your (.edu) connection and situation
</I>&gt;<i> are not universal.  (Be thankful you don't have to live in fear of online
</I>&gt;<i> stalking, any of you that have not experienced such, also.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This &quot;dialback&quot; concept you refer to, in 1.2 servers, appears to slam
</I>&gt;<i> the door in the face of the dialup users out here.  Well, at least
</I>&gt;<i> the ones who cared enough about privacy to follow that security mantra
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned above.
</I>&gt;<i>  IF YOU WANT SECURITY / SAFETY / PRIVACY, RUN YOUR OWN SERVERS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; invalid address. Soon (not now, as 1.0 still exists and is for the time
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; being supported), this won't work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those desiring security / safety / privacy, it appears Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;soon&quot; to be an inappropriate solution, if this is an indicator.
</I>&gt;<i> The impression I have gotten from your words is that 1.0 is the last
</I>&gt;<i> server to allow end-users on dialup connections to run their own servers,
</I>&gt;<i> and additionally, that 1.0 is about to be unsupported &quot;soon.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  IF YOU WANT SECURITY / SAFETY / PRIVACY, RUN YOUR OWN SERVERS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that is an accurate assessment, this bothers me greatly.
</I>&gt;<i> Then again, so does having a door slammed in my face.  Hard.
