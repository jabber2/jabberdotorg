<PRE>Hey,

&lt;snip/&gt;
&gt;<i> Eww.  Evil.  Does this happen to anyone wanting to run a 1.2 server?
</I>&gt;<i> Are we stuck using 1.0 servers because of this?
</I>
Evil?  personally, i think it's totally cool, since it completely verifies that the server sending messages *is* the server it says it is.  it makes server to server communications as secure as DNS.

however, no, you are not stuck... In the 1.2 server, there is a server.c file, that you can compile as pthsock_server.so, that is the 1.0 style server-server functionality.

&gt;<i>  &gt; this is usually users.jabber.org... the only central user
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; database... unless you want to run your own JUD.. in that case you will
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; need the JUD code from Ryan Eatmon, and a working mySQL database.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought that wasn't going to be available for some time now.  I agree
</I>&gt;<i> that many of us will not want to make all of our info available on the
</I>&gt;<i> public Internet this way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, privacy seems to be being attacked with changing versions.
</I>
eh?  this is how it's been since JUD was first created.  JUD wants to be a fully distributed searchable entity, but we haven't figured out how to do that in a global-scalable way as of yet... so right now, there is one Central JUD server, users.jabber.org.  the point of JUD is for users to find other people on the internet, you have to purposely PUT your info into JUD, so other people can find it.  there are no privacy issues at stake, if you don't want people finding you, don't put your info into JUD.

Keith
