<PRE>&gt;<i> Are you planning to port/maintain MIO back on  the 1.2.x series, or maintain separate branches for MIO and non-MIO transports (for bug fixes) ? I'm very nervous that many people have barely been able to get the server working (much fewer the transports), and you are now moving on to a new incompatible series.
</I>
The Short answer.. No... MIO will not be back ported to 1.2 however, it is trivial to just run a 1.3 server for transports that need it, and 1.2 as your main server.. jabber.org is doing this right now for MSN Transport, since it needs 1.3 server, but jabber.org is running 1.2... it's kindof a trade-off, and could suck to implement, if you weren't a config-wizard, but I'd be glad to show anyone how to do this =]

&gt;<i> Also, while you could register multiple times with ICQ, it would be very difficult to decide which ICQ session to send messages through (if you have user 1 registered with transport session 1 and user 2 registered with transport session 2,  and session 2 is down, do you send through session 1? if both sessions have user1 registered, how do you present the choice of sessions to users?).  Most clients already have to deal with enough complexity - if you are going to dangle a carrot, at least have the decency to show the rotten side of it ;-)
</I>
Ya, I totally missed that point.. temas pointed that out to me just before I read this post =[  Okay, totally scratch that Idea.. it doesn't work, and there isn't a clean way to make it work, so that the user has total control over how her messages are sent.

&gt;<i> &gt; 7&gt; That's all i can think of now.. if you have more issues you would like to see make it into transports, I'd love to hear them, or if you want to make corrections to these items, or comment, send them back to this list!
</I>
I just thought of another one for point 7... =]

7&gt; Virtual Hosts -- The transport should be able to support any number of virtual hosts.  This can be done simply by not storing the transport's jid anywhere in the transport, and just reply with the jid that got you the message, (i.e. the to field on the message).  this will be neccessary for base_farm, to farm out the transports, since it will fork the transport several times, and give them all different host names to handle different subsets of users -- and it's nice for an admin to be able to give the transport different names, if they want to.
