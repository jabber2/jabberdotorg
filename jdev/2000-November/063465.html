<PRE> Hi!!  all
        for last couple of days I was figuring out whats the upper limit of
no of users jabber can support
concurrently. what I can figure out is that jabber as a server can be used
for small no of clients only .

1) memorey diappointment .
    With pth, the individual user threads get 32k (correct me pease if I'm
wrong) so 10,000 users would use up 320MB.
    if we are having 1GB of RAM then atmost 30,000 user will be supported
concurrently.
    beside this pth is not kernel based so if dual propressor is used its of
no use to jabber .
2)TCP connection :
It should also be noted that by default, Linux will only accept 1024 TCP
connections. Adding more simo connections requires a kernel patch to
increase
this limit. to what limit we can increase this ?? If I am not wrong then one
connection will be dedicated to one user
,I meant each tread will be revoling around one connection . will it means
maximum atmost 1024 will be online at a time .
but its also known that :
sockets absolute limitation is 64k since the port value is 2 bytes wide. So,
with
TCP/IP you cannot have more then 64k connections (this is a theoretical
maximum, in reality more limitations apply) even if you have a
server-machine that can handle the load

3)Distributed approach.
     well 1st &amp; 2nd point is true for any server which is based on Pth &amp; TCP
.
     but agin Lot is taked about distributed approch in jabber .but how to
implement it practically is no where written neither
in jabber docs nor in mailling archives . suppose if I am running 3 jabber
servers in 3 different machines then how to
syncronize them or co-relate them .
or how to install one master jabber server
  with 3-4 salve servers distributed .

mine whole aim is to use jabber at very high end of user numbers.

thanks in advance !!
