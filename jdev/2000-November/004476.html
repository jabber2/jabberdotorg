<PRE>Hello Jabberers :)

As we are using jabber in our whole company within our 4 branches (2x
Germany/Singapore/India) with about 100 employees we are really quite
interested in the development of jabber and it`s clients.
As we found JabberIM the most easiest client for our employees we have
integrated the latest JabberIM v0.9.6.78 version in our Intranet ! This
client is very good and also very flexible but after a while of
testing/using we are still missing important features in JabberIM ! This
features I just want to write down here in the hope to get some response
from the developers.

1.
As we want to force our empoyees to use that client (many just want to skip
it) it will be great to have a option (perhaps in the registry) so that
JabberIM can not be closed !! Only with killing the application from the
TaskManager it should be possible to remove it from the system !

2. The top right close gadget should not close the applictation, it should
just minimize it like in other clients !

3.
As we installed JabberIM on our LOGONSERVER and installed it in the NETLOGON
scripts of our employees we first faced lots of problems with such a remote
installation ! The importants one were the mass of registry entries we had
to trace and reproduce in our logon scripts (JabberCOM.DLL make a hell of a
registry entries!) or is there another way to do this ?

4.
It will be great if also things like Adding/Removing/Changing/Finding
Contacts can be restricted with setting the registry correctly because we
want to force our employees to use JabberIM only internally !

It will be great to get some reponse on the above points and perhaps this
features/changes can be done very soon and we are also very very interested
in betatesting the latest JabberIM clients within our company !

Thanks for your help and go on with your GREAT work !
