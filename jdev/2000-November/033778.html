<PRE>Hello list!

Jabber 1.2 itself is working fine for me, but I would like to move over 
certain things over to external programs, for example do all 
user/password lookups via an LDAP dbase, and use a fast SQL dbase for 
roster lists etc.

I haven't been able to find much documentation regarding jabber 1.2, for 
example the XML messaging used between modules (I got as far as &lt;root 
xmlns='jabber:component:exec'&gt; for for example an xdb &lt;exec&gt; script).

I would like to turn off the standard password checking and roster 
lookups and use my own scripts for it.


If anyone can point me to appropriate documention, or has it working 
themselves, it would be very much appreciated :-) If you have it working 
yourself, a config file should be enough for me to figure most things 
out myself. (the configs directory in the jabber source doesn't have 
much variation).

On a side note, from what I gathered using jabberd -D the authorization 
module supplies the password in plaintext to another module that 
compares it to the password that was given by the client. Most likely 
though I am missing something here :-) The LDAP passwords will be hashed 
irreversibly, I would like to compare hashes, not plaintext passwords.

Secondly, what is the maximum size of a message? For example, does 
jabberd stream a message through while it is receiving it, or does it 
first receive the entire message, and then route it and send it? What is 
the performance when spools get very very big?

Thanks in advance for any help!
I am not expecting any huge howto's, but if you have more working then 
me I would love a peek at your configuration :-)

Regards,
Dennis!
