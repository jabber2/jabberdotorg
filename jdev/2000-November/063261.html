<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>i recently went to a little presentation on groove (groove.net) which is
ray ozzie's new collaboration tool/network.

groove has been running as one of those high profile stealth-mode
companies (like transmeta) so i was pysched to see a little of what they
had been working on.(remembering vaguely that they had finally come out of
the closest, but having not had time to follow up)

groove, in a sentence, is a p2p (whatever that means) groupware app,
messaging, shared spaces, collaboration, etc.

i first perked up my ears when i heard the term &quot;groove communicates
between servers and clients via an xml stream of deltas&quot;.  well the phrase
&quot;xml stream&quot; made me thing of jabber, and that is how i thought of it for
the rest of the presentation.

users can communicate directly peer-to-peer but will often find each other
through servers.  these servers handle registering presences (jabber
again), and use transports(!!) to be &quot;device agnostic&quot;, i.e. talk to cell
phones and whatever other gadgets people have.

so my question is, is jabber being used for anything like this?  in the
backend, to provide the communications framework for an application?  how
suited is jabber to this sort of role?  in my shallow analysis of the
space it would seem like jabber would be very suited to this.

any thoughts, feedback?
