<PRE>This is an act on AOL's part to scare users into not using a 
different system because if you're not using AOLs system, then 
you're not getting AOL advertising.

Is there a threat? Yes. In theory, someone could write a transport 
that collected passwords of users as they logged into the 
transports. But then, you can do that now by sniffing the public 
internet because none of the messaging clients encrypt their 
authentication :).

Thus AOL believes most people don't know that fact and will try to 
spread as much FUD as possible, just Microsoft has done.

Can any programmer working on transport related code for jabber.org get their hands on thousands of AOL passwords?  Can anyone setting up their own
