<PRE>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">owner-jdev at jabber.org</A> [mailto:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">owner-jdev at jabber.org</A>]On Behalf Of
</I>&gt;<i> Jeremie
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [JDEV] Win client, File Transfers, invite tag..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	I will promise to at least have a Windows test client ready
</I>&gt;<i> by then.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been unfortionatly busy as heck, and haven't had any time to
</I>&gt;<i> have a working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client with the new protocol complete.  Looks for a big Win32
</I>&gt;<i> checkin to the
</I>&gt;<i> Excellent on all of the above points!  The C in /lib/* should be mostly
</I>&gt;<i> XP, so you might want to look at just using the whole common lib... but
</I>&gt;<i> there might be some excellent reasons not to for win32 stuff.
</I>
	Yea, looking at it, I'm going to try to reuse as much of the command line
code as possible to keep things as the 'same' as possible.  The primary
difference is I can easily multithread the backend, and keep it seperate
from the UI.. ;-P

&gt;<i> HTTP/1.1
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, that's right... let's use HTTP/1.1!  It already has EVERYTHING needed
</I>&gt;<i> to handle any type of file transfer, and it's commonplace, and it works.
</I>&gt;<i> Here's how, simple version:
</I>&gt;<i> 	user x sending file to user z
</I>&gt;<i> 	z recieves message and uses HTTP/1.1 to GET file
</I>
	Only one problem (Which someone else has already pointed out..  Yes, I
cheat and read ahead.. ;-P).  This make a client to client connection, and
broadcasts the IP address to clients.  I know, you're addressing it via a
transport.  (Notice the other message regarding transport overload, as well,
though)..

&gt;<i> Ok, benifits:
</I>&gt;<i> 	HTTP/1.1 can do resumes if it get's broken.
</I>&gt;<i> 	ICQ/AIM transports could impliment &quot;translator&quot; daemons for it
</I>&gt;<i> 	Recieving client could just spawn browser to fetch file
</I>&gt;<i> 	Happens in background, leaves Jabber connection to work normally
</I>&gt;<i> 	This could be simply a URL message, not specific for files
</I>
	I like it..  For ordinary file transfers, and a transport of some sort,
this would be wonderful.

&gt;<i> 	A special module could be written on the Jabber server to use this
</I>&gt;<i> functionaliy for a &quot;file archive&quot;.  The client would send a jabber message
</I>&gt;<i> to the module and ask for a repository, this would be configurable
</I>&gt;<i> obviously so only special users could use it or have size limits. The
</I>&gt;<i> module would reply with an: <A HREF="http://serverIPaddress:port/.">http://serverIPaddress:port/.</A>  The client
</I>&gt;<i> would then PUT files up there via HTTP, and authenticate them with the
</I>&gt;<i> users username/password.  Then it would send out the location to GET them
</I>&gt;<i> like any other file message as above.  This would allow you to send files
</I>&gt;<i> to offline users, as well as send files to groups of users, just upload it
</I>&gt;<i> once and they all download it.  It is also a solution for transferring
</I>&gt;<i> files if you are going through a firewall.  Actually, it could end up just
</I>&gt;<i> being a normal apache and a special module or similiar... and you'd have
</I>&gt;<i> your own personal webspace...
</I>
	This I REALLY like..  You could actually automate client upgrades this way,
but having a server send out a file get message to users clients who have
'registered' with a transport to recieve update file announcements.

	Heck, a company could use features like this to use jabber client/server as
their 'support' system fairly easily.  Build in basic jabber support into
the program, and users can communicate via jabber for technical support,
file upgrades, new announcements, etc..

&gt;<i> There are some issues here yet, but I think this is the best way to go in
</I>&gt;<i> some form.  I've really gotta sit down and think this through clearly and
</I>&gt;<i> get it written down, but hopefully this will get the discussion started :)
</I>
	Please do..  I LOVE the idea itself, but I can still see holes that needs
to be addressed.
