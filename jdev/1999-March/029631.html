<PRE>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">owner-jdev at jabber.org</A> [mailto:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">owner-jdev at jabber.org</A>]On Behalf Of
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">qbradley at csc.UVic.CA</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [JDEV] Win client, File Transfers, invite tag..
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is a great idea, but I have a few suggestions.  Why don't you
</I>&gt;<i> call it &quot;uumessagetransfer&quot; instead of &quot;wintransfer&quot;, as that would be a
</I>&gt;<i> more accurate description of what it does.
</I>
	Ordinarily, yes, I would use something like that. But do to the current
status of client development, I figured something that I KNEW I could use
that would identify it without messing with something else someone else may
be developing was much more prudent..

&gt;<i> Also, instead of using a random number to idenfity file transfers, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> an md5 hash of the original file would be better.
</I>
	Either way would work, but a random number is easier.. ;-P

&gt;<i> One thing to consider is how it handles sending enormous files.  It would
</I>&gt;<i> be desireable that a file transfer could be started without reading in the
</I>&gt;<i> entire file in advance, or converting it to uuencoded format in advance.
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to precisely predict the uuencoded size from the original
</I>&gt;<i> size?  If not, then perhaps using the original files size instead of the
</I>&gt;<i> uuencoded files size in the protocol would allow the file to be uuencoded
</I>&gt;<i> bit by bit while it was transfered.
</I>
	Yes, this would be the best..  This was merely done as a quick 'I can
develop file transfer REALLY easy with this'.  And it also a VERY reliable
way to transfer binary data via a text transfer..  Also, the exact file size
is used to tell if it all worked..  Again, merely a quickie to do it..

&gt;<i> As for packet sizes, larger packets might actually be better than smaller
</I>&gt;<i> packets, but of course there will be some middle point that works out the
</I>&gt;<i> best.
</I>
	It's a toss up between proccesser time and memory performance..  Smaller
packets leadto less memory usage, but more 'packets'.  Getting to small
would be silly, but I was figuring 10-50 k at a chunk..

&gt;<i> The reason I think this might be the case is that smaller packets will
</I>&gt;<i> require more processing by the server.  Processing time is probably more
</I>&gt;<i> valuable than memory.  Also, memory might not be saved at all by smaller
</I>&gt;<i> packets because you would probably just end up sending more in a given
</I>&gt;<i> period of time.  This would mean more processing on the server, as well as
</I>&gt;<i> more memory use because of the increased overhead from the information
</I>&gt;<i> with each packet.
</I>
	I would say for future reference, I'd let the server at some point give a
'prefered packet size'.  This would allow the transport to give that
particular data itself.. But as I said, this is a quickie, so it'll prob.
all change..

&gt;<i> In fact, a packet size of 60k or so might be better.  Many files could be
</I>&gt;<i> sent in one packet, which would make it quite efficient.
</I>
	See above..  Currently, my sceme (from a client side) doesn;t allow more
then one file per send (But multiple sends at a a TIME are ok).  Again,
scratch it off to a quickie..

&gt;<i> This brings up another question, how fast to send packets?  If they are
</I>&gt;<i> sent as fast as possible, they could pile up at the server, which wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be nice for the server.  But if you have replies being sent, you could
</I>&gt;<i> time them to get an idea of how fast things are going through and pace the
</I>&gt;<i> rate at which you send them.  But this adds complication.
</I>
	Exactly why I had the idea of replies, but that also get's in the way.  I'm
figuring ONE message sent that the user is offline, then a question as to if
you want to send it as an offline message, not using the 'client-server'
sceme..

&gt;<i> Mabye replies and pacing should be an optional feature for advanced
</I>&gt;<i> implemenations.
</I>
	See my last reply.. ;-P
