&gt;<i> A problem I ran into connecting to my jabber server from home is that our
</I>&gt;<i> firewall times out idle connections after a period of time. The way I'm
</I>&gt;<i> getting around this right now is sending a status message every 5 minutes if
</I>&gt;<i> no traffic has been received from the server.
</I>
I've seen similiar things... many things like to drop idle TCP
connections, which seems naughty but it happens, so...

&gt;<i> Any thoughts to adding a ping/pong tag to the protocol?
</I>
Yes, many :)

It's going to need this for one primary reason, TCP doesn't know to drop
the connection when the other end &quot;dissappears&quot;, such as a dialup
connection breaking and not disconnecting properly.  There is a built in
KEEPALIVE available for TCP connections, but vendor implementations are
way to flaky to make it useful.

TCP _does_ drop the connection if the server sends data though.
Apparently you can send NULL's, err, absolutely empty TCP packets that
will cause the normal two way TCP traffic over a connection.  But I
haven't tried it yet, so I don't know that for sure.  If it works as I
understand it, I'll have the server create this activity on the connection
at a regular interval.  This shouldn't require any changes on the clients
end of things.

&gt;<i> Also, I'm using &lt;ext&gt; within the &lt;status&gt; tags for some information specific
</I>&gt;<i> to our product, but what I noticed is that the server escapes anything
</I>&gt;<i> within the &lt;status&gt; even though it's the &lt;ext&gt; tag (I'm still running 0.5 as
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't been able to get 0.6 to build yet).
</I>
Yes, that's a 0.5 thing(everything outgoing was escaped).  0.6 will allow
you to put normal XML tags inside the &lt;ext&gt;&lt;/ext&gt; and they will be passed
through as XML tags.
