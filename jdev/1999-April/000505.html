<PRE>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">owner-jdev at jabber.org</A> [mailto:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">owner-jdev at jabber.org</A>]On Behalf Of
</I>&gt;<i> Jeremie
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [JDEV] Suggestions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To begin, let's start with a technique known as &quot;commenting&quot;. :)
</I>&gt;<i> I'm the one to burn at the stake for this one, *grin*.
</I>&gt;<i> The dearth of comments is a problem, even for myself maintaining the code.
</I>&gt;<i> For some time now I've been planning on going through and commenting
</I>&gt;<i> everything, it just keeps getting put off and nobody has complained yet.
</I>&gt;<i> But, now that someone is asking I'll make this a priority and check-in a
</I>&gt;<i> ton of comments this week.
</I>
	Ok, I'm not really going to add it as another 'complaint', but you should
at least have an README.xpt that secribes how it works, described jpairs,
and all of the functions..  I figured them out, but it'd be nice to see
changes in the docs as the functions change, so I can change what I need to
on the other end..

&gt;<i> &gt; Well I must go now, but I'd like to hear your feedback before I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; continue. Maybe I'm wrong (it's happened before!), but I'd love to see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber take off. I believe it's the Right Concept. All we gotta do now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is execute properly. :)
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, perfect!  If you think you have some time to seriously help out on
</I>&gt;<i> these parts, we can work on getting you commit access and familiarized
</I>&gt;<i> with the rest of the group :)
</I>
	I agree.  I'm seeing so many ways Jabber could be used, as I said earlier,
for things NOTHING to do with person to person IM.  It's almost like
programs being able to send email to eachother to communicate, but without
the overhead.

	I also must say I'm sorry for not having finished of the demo Perl code, or
done as much work on the Win32 client as I would have liked as of recent.
We WILL have a basic working client for the release by the first, I promise
that, but I'm afraid all of the bells and wistles may not be tested much/or
work.  I should also have the Mobilecomm pager transport working, which will
also be extensible by specifying a provider.  All you'd need to do is supply
a 'template' URL to call up with the information.  Here's an example:

<A HREF="http://epage.arch.com/cgi-bin/epage.cgi?response_page=http%3A%2F%2Fepage.arc">http://epage.arch.com/cgi-bin/epage.cgi?response_page=http%3A%2F%2Fepage.arc</A>
h.com%2Fresponse.html&amp;mailto=@PAGERNUMBER@&amp;from=&amp;replyto=&amp;subject=&amp;message=@
MESSAGE@

	In this example, @PAGERNUMBER@ will get replaced wih the pagerID, (aka,
message sent to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">167289 at pagerperl</A> will replace it with 167289), and @MESSAGE@
will contain the message, escaped as needed to be pushed thru via HTTP GET.
Another example:

<A HREF="http://www.mobilecomm.com/cgi-bin/wwwpage.exe?PIN=@PAGERNUMBER&amp;MSSG=@MESSAGE">http://www.mobilecomm.com/cgi-bin/wwwpage.exe?PIN=@PAGERNUMBER&amp;MSSG=@MESSAGE</A>
@&amp;Q1=2

	This one does thesame as above, but for mobilecomm pagers.  Same thing,
get's via HTTP GET, sends the message..
