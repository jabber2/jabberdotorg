<PRE>The code in question (cryptlib) would be used in both the server and the
client.  The server would make use of mod_digsig to give it support for
dealing with digital signature capable clients...so one would think that
you would want as many as possible (if not all) servers to have this
support enabled, as otherwise their clients cannot make use of their
extended capabilities.  mod_digsig allows clients to securely log on, as
well as for the server to be able to issue digital certificates.  The code
would be used on the client end for signing and verification when dealing
with other clients (and also for securely logging onto the server).  The
license thing could be skirted a bit (as you suggested) if it was just a
separate module that could be downloaded/enabled at will...and clients
will be much this way.  (client authors can choose to make vanilla as well
as authenticated clients available)  *But*, since you'll likely want as
many servers as possible to have it enabled, it's going to be the case
that the license issue will come up with all of the servers running it.
