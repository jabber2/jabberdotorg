<PRE>&gt;<i> Hmm. I like it, but I also would like to see it partially conform to the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;standard&quot; that seems to be existing in most packages. Notably, a tree
</I>&gt;<i> looking like this :
</I>
Agreed... I was assuming what I knew about the &quot;standard&quot; based on the
hundreds, err, thousands of app installs I've done over the years across
various platforms :)

&gt;<i> /usr/local/jabber
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	README
</I>&gt;<i> 	/bin (clients)
</I>&gt;<i> 	/sbin (xrouter, transports, and scripts )
</I>
Ok, even better, I like the seperation, especially when both bin areas
start to grow. 

&gt;<i> 	/lib (libraries? currently they are all static, so this maybe unnecessary)
</I>&gt;<i> 	/include (most likely unnecessary at this point as well)
</I>
Yeah, everything is static so that's not needed.  Maybe in the future with
the client lib or something similiar though.

&gt;<i> 	/man (yup)
</I>&gt;<i> 	/share (not sure what the distinction is between this and the next one)
</I>&gt;<i> 	/etc (but i do believe that the jabber.conf should be stored in one of them)
</I>
I definately like /etc instead.

&gt;<i> 	/logs (not necessarily conforming, but i like logs better than var)
</I>
Yes, /logs is happy... but we'll probably need a /var for the time being,
so that mod_basic can store/spool things on the filesystem(offline
messages, rosters, etc)

&gt;<i> I like the idea of putting all the files under one tree, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> putting the man pages into a central directory. Most systems already have
</I>&gt;<i> several different man paths, and although it may be trickier for a user to
</I>&gt;<i> add the path, if they would want (heaven forbid) to delete jabber, it
</I>&gt;<i> would be easy to do so.
</I>
Well, Jabber will be updated frequently, so it's probably best to keep it
as seperate as possible.  But I'm not sure about the man pages part... I
don't think it's a big deal to litter up /usr/local/man with this stuff,
it really doesn't take up space or effect functionality of anything, so I
don't see a problem with it... either way I guess it's no biggie since
it's configurable via ./configure :)
