<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; d] uin's / id's / searching -- this might seem too simplistic, but, basically,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how's the &quot;search for a user&quot; work?  the jabber distribution model seems to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imply that no one server can know where every other jabber server is -- thus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would there have to be a central jabber &quot;directory server&quot; that every jabber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server would have to have a special module to connect to?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would not be trivial to make a &quot;search for user&quot; option but there are a
</I>&gt;<i> few ways you could go about it.  One approach would be to have a voluntary
</I>&gt;<i> directory where people could enter their jabber adresses and names.  This
</I>&gt;<i> is an approach I would favor.  Another possibility would be to extend the
</I>&gt;<i> servers to perhaps respond to a query from a user with a list of users.
</I>&gt;<i> This has lots of problems, first being that you would need a standard way
</I>&gt;<i> of addressing servers and the second being that many users would not want
</I>&gt;<i> to be listed in such ways.  Furthermore, you would still need a list of
</I>&gt;<i> servers which probably would not be all that accurate.  I think one or
</I>&gt;<i> many voluntary databases where people can enter their names and make
</I>&gt;<i> queries is the best approach.
</I>
I really like the voluntary approach also... probably something
@jabber.org would be a good plan.

Here is another idea that might just work: Reaper.  This is based on the
&lt;query/&gt; proposal(and one of the reasons for querying).  Basically, a
client doing a search would send a search query to their server.  Their
server would then query all the modules to see if that is a local user.
Then, failing that, the server could forward the query on to a
master-query server, the Reaper.  The Reaper would routinely connect to
any known(registered) public servers and query them for &quot;public&quot; users,
basically users that opt-in for this service.  It would collect them and
use that as a search base for the master queries.

Again, this needs real-world implementation and testing...
