<PRE>&gt;<i> I wouldn't mind at all. Gimme some comments and I'll give you some
</I>&gt;<i> docs. :)

En-route, shipping overnight via CVS :)

&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the Jabber project is *really* going to take advantage of XML, it
</I>&gt;<i> seems like we oughta go ahead and implement the fully DOM internally.
</I>&gt;<i> It's a lot of extra work, initally, but it would really simplify the
</I>&gt;<i> final architecture and implementation of new transports, modules, etc... 
</I>
You don't know how many time's I've almost started coding this :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I concur with you. Let's write a DOM. :) I found a C++
</I>&gt;<i> implementation on another project (www.berlin-consortium.org) and we
</I>&gt;<i> can probably use that as an example...
</I>
And here's the reasons I haven't started it yet: complexity... The DOM is
overly-complex so that it can handle ANY XML data for ANY purpose.  Here
within Jabber we only have one set of data and one purpose, so there is a
large amount of overhead and extra work in the DOM that is not needed.

My approach is thus:  if there is a simple C-based clean DOM
implementation that sits ontop of Expat cleanly, I'll be the first to
check that sucker in and redo the parts that would rely on it.  I don't
have the time to go writing it at this point(although I'd love to, not
just for Jabber but for other small projects).  Also, all Jabber _really_
needs to do is extract the data from the protocol, only a few(10-20) lines
of code do this part, and it's clean and simple with xpt at this point, so
why spend many days rewriting already working simple code?

Once Jabber is humming along smoothly, and I get time to play again, I'll
definately be taking a second look at this though, since I'd really like
it ;-)
