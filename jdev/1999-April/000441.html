<PRE>	Guys, I've got a little problem that has me confused, perhaps someone can
give me some insight..

	When running jabberbox on a RedHat 5.2 (glibc) based machine, everythings
fine..  If I compile and run it on my HOME machine, which is Slackware
(libc5) based machine, it comes up with:

[Thu Apr 15 22:51:44 1999] main &quot;config=config.x&quot;
[Thu Apr 15 22:51:44 1999] lib &quot;parsing_file=config.x&quot;
[Thu Apr 15 22:51:44 1999] lib &quot;Creating new XML Parser pool&quot;
[Thu Apr 15 22:51:44 1999] main &quot;Unable to open log file!&quot;
[Thu Apr 15 22:51:44 1999] main &quot;JabberBox starting&quot;
[Thu Apr 15 22:51:44 1999] lib &quot;IO: collecting data&quot;
[Thu Apr 15 22:51:44 1999] main &quot;dispatch_data=(NULL)&quot;
[Thu Apr 15 22:51:44 1999] main &quot;Initialization from IO loop&quot;
[Thu Apr 15 22:51:44 1999] lib &quot;Created parent net socket&quot;
net socket: Address already in use

	I've quadruple checked, the addresses are NOT in use..  The log file in
/tmp get's created, but there's nothing in it.  (The above says it can't
becouse I removed the log line in config.x, to see if not using the Log file
would fix it in some strange way..)  The net socket: Address already in use
message is NOT part of jabberbox's code as far as I can grep, nor in the lib
code.  Any idea's?
