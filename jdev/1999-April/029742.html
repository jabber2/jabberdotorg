They can be written in anything as long as they can read and write XML
over a socket.

It would not be trivial to make a &quot;search for user&quot; option but there are a
few ways you could go about it.  One approach would be to have a voluntary
directory where people could enter their jabber adresses and names.  This
is an approach I would favor.  Another possibility would be to extend the
servers to perhaps respond to a query from a user with a list of users.
This has lots of problems, first being that you would need a standard way
of addressing servers and the second being that many users would not want
to be listed in such ways.  Furthermore, you would still need a list of
servers which probably would not be all that accurate.  I think one or
many voluntary databases where people can enter their names and make
queries is the best approach.
