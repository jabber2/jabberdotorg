&gt;<i> Firstly, that's an excellent description of the terminology, wanna help
</I>&gt;<i> write developer docs?  *grin*
</I>
I wouldn't mind at all. Gimme some comments and I'll give you some
docs. :)

&gt;<i> This is mostly my fault for lack-of-comments at this point, but what you
</I>&gt;<i> describe is almost exactly what the xpt structure is in the client lib.
</I>&gt;<i> The only big difference is that it uses jpairs(simple linked lists) for
</I>&gt;<i> the attributes and is C based with supporting functions instead of a C++
</I>&gt;<i> class.
</I>
That's cool. Makes a little more sense now...
 
&gt;<i> problem, the W3C has blessed the DOM as the &quot;standard&quot; way to express
</I>&gt;<i> parsed XML via an API.  I'd love to start working on a simple C based DOM
</I>
Doh! I thought I had come up with a awesome solution to the world's
problems XML...Oh well. :) I've skimmed over the DOM this morning
(while i shoulda been studying for finals) and was pretty impressed. If
the Jabber project is *really* going to take advantage of XML, it seems
like we oughta go ahead and implement the fully DOM internally. It's a
lot of extra work, initally, but it would really simplify the final
architecture and implementation of new transports, modules, etc...

&gt;<i> I haven't done any c++, but everything I know about it makes me want to :)
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a very object-based thinker, so everything I've been doing in C is
</I>&gt;<i> just about object oriented as C gets.
</I>
Da, I noticed that in the code. Kudos to you and the others. :) It
would probably be good to continue this approach. 

&gt;<i> The problem is that I really believe that the core code(server and libs)
</I>&gt;<i> should be entirely pure cross platform C.  I've seen all kinds of
</I>
This really isn't a big problem, either. With good code organization
and a pseudo-object oriented approach it shouldn't be all that hard to
share the advantages of both. And when we want to provide C++ access to
the DOM, parser and such, writing a set of c++ wrappers will be trivial.
 
&gt;<i> Most importantly, if your preference is C++, simply implement the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> and your set, no need to utilize anything else if you are capable of going
</I>&gt;<i> it your own.  There's probably lots better ways to do things in pure C++
</I>&gt;<i> and there's no reason we can't distribute that as an option :)
</I>
True, I guess. However, this kinda defeats the reason of having a
&quot;common&quot; library. :) 

So, I concur with you. Let's write a DOM. :) I found a C++
implementation on another project (www.berlin-consortium.org) and we
can probably use that as an example...
