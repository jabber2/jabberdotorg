</I>
Roster lists and status messages are seperate things in Jabber with
seperate purposes. The roster is stored and delivered by the server/module
handling the connected user, and the status messages arrive independantly
from the remote users as they come online or change their status. 

I can't see any benefit of combining the two, in fact, the seperation
gives Jabber an edge.  If there is any actual reason or benifit that you
see for combining them, then well take a look at both approaches and see
how they work out.

Also, it looks like you might be confused on how Jabber accounts
work(don't worry, it's easy to confuse at the beginning).  When you are
using a Jabber client and are using Jabber to connect to other
systems(ICQ/AIM/etc), You are still only one ID.  So others that are
connected to all of them VIA JABBER are also only one ID and will only
appear as one &quot;Jabber&quot; user in your list.  BUT, others on IRC/ICQ/etc will
be able to see YOU, and THEY will appear as a seperate users in your list.

BUT, if there is a user out there that actually has a Jabber client, ICQ
client, and AIM client all running at the same time(Jabber _should_ be
able to replace the other two so this won't be needed, that's the whole
point) there will be three ways of talking to them if you are using
Jabber, Jabber-&gt;Jabber, Jabber-&gt;ICQ, Jabber-&gt;AIM.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!

Thanks,

Jer
