<PRE>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">owner-jdev at jabber.org</A> [mailto:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">owner-jdev at jabber.org</A>]On Behalf Of
</I>&gt;<i> Jeremie
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [JDEV] my interest -- a few questions
</I>&gt;<i> Wonderful!  Perl can be a big boon to Jabber, and I just haven't had the
</I>&gt;<i> time to really work on it yet... although I know Thomas Charron has done
</I>&gt;<i> some.
</I>
	Yep, done some..  UGLY as sin code, though..  If this week ever let's up,
I'm going to rewrite it to contain a hash of functions that will call on the
end tag and pass the text contained within the tag, something like:

%FunctionHash = ({&quot;message&quot;, \&amp;IncomingMessage}, {&quot;status&quot;, \&amp;Status});

	Then when a message comes in, upon the end of the function, it will do a
&amp;$FunctionHash{&quot;message&quot;}($TheText);

	(I just pulledthat out of my rear, ok, It may bewrong, I stillrefer to the
perl man pagesat times..)

&gt;<i> It hasn't been talked about much yet, but at this point a user is really
</I>&gt;<i> tied to their server, similiar to how your email client is tied to your
</I>&gt;<i> email server.  On the same note, providing forwarding will definately be
</I>&gt;<i> added to one of the modules so that messages can be forwarded to your new
</I>&gt;<i> location like in email.
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing I've been mulling around, is that any of the common
</I>&gt;<i> settings for your user account(name/password/security/preferences/etc)
</I>&gt;<i> could be expressed in a common XML structure, and could be saved by the
</I>&gt;<i> user or automatically sent from the old server to the new server, but that
</I>&gt;<i> is a discussion that will have to wait till we have something to really
</I>&gt;<i> test it with.
</I>
	Good idea!!  You could even store the password in crypt() form.  And in
order to GET the XML profile, the requesting server would need to provide a
password in crypt() form..  If it matched, it'd send it..  This would make
it so that no server could get a password list to try to crack, as you'd
already need to KNOW the password to get it..  Perhaps even an option the
have a different 'remote access' password?
