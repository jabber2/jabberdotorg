<PRE>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">owner-jdev at jabber.org</A> On Behalf Of Jeremie
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [JDEV] Client Lib &amp; Associated Thoughts (And Many Capital
</I>&gt;<i> Letters)
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, that's an excellent description of the terminology, wanna help
</I>&gt;<i> write developer docs?  *grin*
</I>
	I second that motion..  All opposed, please raise your hands..  (Tom dawns
a black trench, and a giant super-soaker)

&gt;<i> Now, xpt isn't the most wonderful thing in the world(although it works
</I>&gt;<i> quite well for most simple things), so how do we improve it?  Well, thanks
</I>&gt;<i> to the fact that we're not the only ones trying to solve this very
</I>&gt;<i> problem, the W3C has blessed the DOM as the &quot;standard&quot; way to express
</I>&gt;<i> parsed XML via an API.  I'd love to start working on a simple C based DOM
</I>&gt;<i> and will do so if the need presents itself, but I'm hoping that someone
</I>&gt;<i> else out there on the net will beat me to it :)
</I>
	You are evil..  You now much die..  (Jer finds himself suddenly SOAKING
wet)..

	What they're not telling you is DOM actually standard for the 'Demonic
Object Model'.  ;-P

&gt;<i> I haven't done any c++, but everything I know about it makes me want to :)
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a very object-based thinker, so everything I've been doing in C is
</I>&gt;<i> just about object oriented as C gets.
</I>
	Actually, you've been using a basterdized idea of what C++ should do in C..
;-P  Basically, functions that do things to structs, which is nearly the
same as having the structs be objects containing the functions you wantto
call on them..  ;-P\

&gt;<i> The problem is that I really believe that the core code(server and libs)
</I>&gt;<i> should be entirely pure cross platform C.  I've seen all kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> arguments back and forth on this very subject(especially on the Apache
</I>&gt;<i> list, whew :), but in the end it still seems that to provide the most
</I>&gt;<i> options to developers and most XP compatability, servers and libs should
</I>&gt;<i> stick with C.
</I>
	Agreed.  We can always encapsulate the C to make it work in an object
oriented language.  Look at the Gtk toolkit.  It's all in C, but you can use
it fromevery language under the sun..
