<PRE>Hi from the JIMMO team, we&#146;re a group of 4 students from the University of
Colorado at Boulder working on a project consisting of developing a Jabber
client adapted for a conferencing interface,

    Ok, the problem that I am having is that the server receives a
connection, does some stuff, and then immediately closes the connection.  I
am currently going through the code to see exactly what it is doing, but
here is a quick description of the problem.  There is a server configuration
file which configures the server.  There is a section called &lt;agents&gt;, which
looks like it may register services to the users...  I am pretty sure that
it is something in the configuration file that needs to be set up so that
the server will allow accounts to be created (but not with the jabber.com
server).  It also looks like it is trying to connect to updates.jabber.com
(presumably for user lists?).  If it is expecting a response from
updates.jabber.com, it will not receive one (because of the router config).
I will try to set up the router so that requests on port 5222 go directly to
the machine running jabber (on port 5222), so it will be able to receive
outside jabber connections.  I will keep you updated on this.  Nick, feel
free to ask the Jabber guys if there is any special configuration you need
to do.  Also, if they have a more detailed step-by-step than the Jabber
Server mini-HOWTO, that would be helpful as well.  Also, where are the
discussion boards on jabber.org?  I created an account, but I don't really
know what that does.  I saw there are IRC chat groups, but I was also
wondering if there was a newsgroup (or an area for posting
messages/solutions) as well.

Please help us,
Thanks.
