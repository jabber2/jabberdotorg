<PRE>Hi Steve,

What you're talking about is really server-side groups as opposed to the
client-side groups that you'll find in the current crop of clients and the
current server. A fair number of people are interested in this functionality
and I believe that Jabber.com has implemented this for one or two of their
clients. A natural integration would be with LDAP or another db that has
concepts of groups and sub-groups -- I'm part of my project team which by
definition is part of my department which by default is part of the IT
group, etc. I'm not sure of the status of such functionality (mainly whether
it is part of the upcoming 1.2 server), but it makes obvious sense for
intranets like yours (not nearly so much for the open internet, where I
don't want anyone adding me to some group without my permission). If you'd
like I can check on when this might be an integral part of Jabber instead of
something that sysadmins need to hack together ... much as I love sed and
awk. :)

Peter
