Cool.

&gt;<i> Anyway, what I really want to know:
</I>&gt;<i>

Those are the only two I've been able to find. 

&gt;<i> * how am I supposed to get the key of the guy I'm talking to? I know 
</I>&gt;<i> Imjay tries to get it from the vCard. And I also thought about using

</I> 
KIM also searches for JID based on email. Not sure if it'll import from
a key server or not. But it seems to me that this would be the best
way to make use of the infrastructure that already exists. Another
possibility, which is a bit of a hybrid, is to store the key ID, or
maybe fingerprint in the vCard as a hint, and fetch it from a key
server to actually get it. The reason I throw this out there is that
sometimes e-mail and jabber ids don't match, and adding a new userid
to a preexisting key isn't necessarily the best fix, but storing the key 
in the vCard could get expensive when, like one of the guys who signed 
my key, your key is ~60k.

&gt;<i> We really should agree on some sort of (semi-)standard. It doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> have to be a full-fledged standard, but at least some guidlines for 
</I>&gt;<i> client authors...
</I>
I'm all for this, too.
