<PRE>Keith:

Thanks for your response.  My comments below yours...

-----Original Message-----
&gt;<i>From: Keith Minkler [mailto:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">keith at digix.dyndns.org</A>]

&gt;<i>well, they will still exchange data, only *slowly*.. 
</I>
Looking closer with a smaller message, I notice that you are correct, they
are still
transferring data, slowly is definitely the keyword.  If I have a 6000-12000
character message that I have each of two clients sent to each other in one
go, then with default
karma settings the transfer is about 20-times slower than if I have karma
turned off,
(140 seconds versus 7 seconds for the transfers to occur, flow rates of 43
bytes/sec
versus 750 bytes/sec).

&gt;&gt;<i> I tried various karma configuration settings, like raising the max to 100
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or so.  Some of these attempts resulted in Jabber 1.2 exiting (no core
</I>dump, 
&gt;&gt;<i> just an exit or an abort) when I ran my client tests.
</I>
&gt;<i>That's interesting.. can you give me the values that are causing the server
</I>to crash?

If you leave all of the karma settings as their defaults and set the maximum
to 100
and then run a test where two clients log on and make their presence's aware
to each
other and then have each client send something like 6000-12000 characters in
a single
message to each other in a single submission from both sides, then jabberd
will die.
I do not find any core file.  My ulimit is a very large number and I was
getting
core dumps when I was playing with Jabber 1.0, so perhaps something is
exiting or
aborting?  I am running jabberd in debug mode and collecting stderr and
stdout to
a file.  I see nothing obvious in the file, the last 3 entries in the file
were all:

    io_select.c:319 io_main checking sockets

&gt;<i>as i mentioned above, it limits the amount of data a &quot;malicious&quot; user can
</I>send 
&gt;<i>at a time, to flood the server, or another user.  it's an i/o limiter.
</I>
The behavior is a pretty steep throttle.  In the the 6000-12000 char message
case
above, it essentially shuts down the xmit window to a trickle until the
message 
finally gets out.

What do you suggest I do if I want to up the burst window by an order of
magnitude or
more?  Can I do that with settings in jabber.xml (what settings might I
use?) or do 
I need to go into the pthsock code and compile larger numbers in?

Just wondering...Are the rates mentioned in the karma.txt document 
  (5.5K/2sec, 1K/2 sec) pretty much regarded as the typical usage/user?  
  I notice that other chat systems like IRC have file transfer capabilities,
  is Jabber expected to be able to do this?  Will these xfer windows work
  for this?  Is this a client issue, meaning that the client needs to be
aware
  of these windows and be intelligent enough to pace itself during
transmissions?

Thanks,

    jim
