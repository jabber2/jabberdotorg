<PRE>Let's start with the basics... what version of the server are you using?  I'm
guessing 1.0, so you could remove the reference to mod_version for what the 
connection to updates.j.o.  If you could supply us with debug output (Run the
jserver with -D) and configuration it will be more easy for us to help you.
