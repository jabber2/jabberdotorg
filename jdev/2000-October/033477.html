<PRE>Problems of CA's in general aside, the bigger issue is using PGP. 
PGP is a great system, but how are you going to get people to 
sign up with existing PGP key servers? In particular the masses of 
people who you want to use the system? If you're only concerned 
with talking with hackers, then PGP is fine.

But to the masses (who don't really care about security in the first 
place, yes they want to be secure,but they don't want to deal with 
it), it's got to be dirt simple. 

Thus you need a commercial infrastructure for it like Verisign (the 
MS monopoly of the 21st century), where I can go, give them $20 
and my credit card number &amp; presto I have a digital certificate 
which I can use to authenticate to Web sites, sign email, and 
perhaps even sign Jabber.

Plus there are products like Netscape's Certificate server, Verisign 
Onsite and openSSL/openCA which allow organizations to manage 
their own certificates. 

It's a lot more than just picking a cool protocol. I've been managing 
certificates (it's a natural outgrowth of being a LDAP guru and 
webmaster) at a large organization for a long time now. Certificates 
aren't perfect, but it's easier IMHO to do this with existing 
infrastructure like X509 than PGP, in particular if you're looking at a 
broader, commercial market.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keysevers can be victims of spoof attacks etc. just like anyone else.

</I>&gt;<i> as trusted &amp; valid) only when you can physically proof it is yours. 
</I>&gt;<i> Since you got the public key of the CA you can be sure other keys 
</I>&gt;<i> signed by that CA a valid (if you trust them is something else, but 
</I>&gt;<i> you can be sure the email/name on the key are correct).
