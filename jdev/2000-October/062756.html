Hash: SHA1

I was going to suggest the same thing.  The upside is that it lets
users use their preexisting keys if they want.  It also gives them
more direct control over security in general.  The downside is that
it just introduces complexity since you're supporting 2 different
ways of doing the same thing.  It might be a good idea to support the
use of vCard as the default, and then add key server communication as
an &quot;option&quot; later on.  I know that there's a lot of other code I'd
like to add to Imjay before I spend time communicating with key
servers.  As for the overhead of storing the key in the vCard, the
keys that Imjay stores there are typically about 400 bytes, and
that's with the BASE64 encoding, so I've got no real problem with
that kind of overhead.

Subject: Re: [JDEV] PGP / Public Key retrieval


Good point. The cynic in me says that the user who doesn't want to 
bother learning how the system works is fooling themselves if they
think it's making it more secure.

Perhaps default to storing a key in the vCard, but allow a
knowledgable
user to switch to storing the key id in the vCard, and let the client
fetch it from a keyserver? I'd hate to see people having to fetch
that
60k key every time they forgot that user's telephone extension. 

Comments, problems with that aproach?
