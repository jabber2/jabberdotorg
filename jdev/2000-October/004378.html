<PRE>Hi,

    Keith, thank you for your advice.  It was a problem with the IP of the server and how the client was connecting to it.  I changed the host name to my IP, and connected to the client.  However, I am now getting authentication errors.  I am also now using a different IP, so the 10.0.0.x numbers do not appear anymore.  I have attached the main part of the debug output where the authentication error happens (also attached the config file), and would appreciate any insight.  I am getting a little more familiar with the overall server, but am still quite new....  Also, if some of the questions I am asking are documented somewhere, can you please point me to that documentation? (so I don't bother the mail list with questions that documentation already covers).  Thank you for your help, I really appreciate it.

&gt;<i>Brian,

</I>&gt;<i>The problem you are having is partly due to a client issue.. you are connecting to 10.0.0.3 as your server &gt;name (in the client) but you have your server hostname set to &quot;Hal&quot;, since it cannot find the host &quot;10.0.0.3&quot; &gt;internally, this is why you are getting configuration erros..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One way to fix this would be to connect to the server name &quot;Hal&quot; in your client, the other would be to add &gt;the tag: &lt;alias to=&quot;Hal&quot;/&gt; into the config section of the &quot;c2s&quot; service.  this will allow for this type of &gt;Proxying, converting all &quot;10.0.0.3&quot; to &quot;Hal&quot; in the server name...  although, I don't believe this has been &gt;fully tested, so let me know if you go this route, and it still doesn't work for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
