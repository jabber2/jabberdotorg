<PRE>I was thinking of doing a hack on my personal server to do this, and then
save them to an area I can search and browse via the web.  The searching would
all be done with PHP scripts.  I later wanted to expand it to be a real DB for
it all, so I could run queries more powerfully.  The only reason I personally
accpet this is because I have server control, not a scare factor there.  For
the primary distribution of Jabber, I don't know where we lean on this subject,
I guess it's really up to you all to decide.

</I>&gt;<i> The main reason to store history on the server is that when you change

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The disadvantages of course are...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You have all your personal conversations sitting on the server and you have
</I>&gt;<i> to trust the admin of that server to keep your data safe and confidential.
</I>&gt;<i> I would hope there would be some type of encryption that could help out
</I>&gt;<i> here.  I suspect that there is no absolute method of  preventing the person
</I>&gt;<i> who is running your server from being able to access your message history if
</I>&gt;<i> they really wanted to, but considering that all the messages are going
</I>&gt;<i> through that server anyway (at present in plain-text) I can't really see it
</I>&gt;<i> being much of an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is going to put a larger load on the servers and take much more disk
</I>&gt;<i> resources.  To give you some idea, I have been using ICQ for years now, and
</I>&gt;<i> never delete history.  My history file is 8.5MB with a 13MB index.  Does
</I>&gt;<i> anyone know how much space companies like Hotmail give you for email
</I>&gt;<i> accounts?  The obvious solution here is to let the admins set a file limit
</I>&gt;<i> and have messages over a certain date expire once that limit is reached.
</I>&gt;<i> This could perhaps be used to an ISP's advantage - they give you a free
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber account with 5MB of space, but for $50/year they will increase it to
</I>&gt;<i> 20MB.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Speed.  Every time you browse the message history, it has to be fetched from
</I>&gt;<i> the server.  Of course this will be less of an issue as bandwidth increases,
</I>&gt;<i> and it could be offset a bit by all the searches etc being done on the
</I>&gt;<i> (faster?) server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't have access to your history if you are not connected to the
</I>&gt;<i> server.  (But then you don't have access to your roster either)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments?
