It is not recommended that the jabber.org transports be used for anything beyond
test servers, as jabber.org is already a development (beta-stability) server, and
already overworked.

That said, transports with valid DNS entries are externally available, while if
the transport is run by the Jabber server and not externally accessable, the name
does *not* necessarily need to be valid in DNS.

</I>
without seeing the resulting XML, this could either be a problem with the
connection between servers, or a downed transport (again, jabber.org is a
development server).

</I>
If it is a completely intranet server, it does not need a connection to the
outside world - just remove mod_update(?) so that it doesn't try to search for new
server versions with jabber.org.

However, if you want to communicate with outside domains, the server does need to
be accessable from the outside, so remote messages come in. As far as I know, the
server connection is supposed to be long-lived, but definately not immortal.
