<PRE>Hi all, I would like to know if the following are possible ? I would
appreciate your comments and suggestions.

1. Say, I have a jabber account(x) which is registered with ICQ-transport 
with an ICQ#(n). Now I delete this account(x) on the jabber server and again 
create a jabber account with the same username and password as the deleted 
jabber account(x). Everything goes fine up to here. After this when I try to 
register this new jabber account(x) with the ICQ-transport, the transport 
behaves strangely. I get the key on request and when I send the key with 
username(jabberid), ICQ#(n) and password, it sends the presence that I am 
off line on ICQ. Some times I do not get any reply from the transport at 
all. I would like if the transport maintains any database where it has the 
jabberid's and ICQ#'s mapped. If this exists then is the mapping of jabberid 
and ICQ# destroyed when you delete your jabber account?

2. Say, I have more than one jabber account on same jabber server. And I 
want to register both the jabber accounts with the ICQ-transport using the 
same ICQ number. Does the transport allow this ?


Amar.
