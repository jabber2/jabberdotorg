Matthias-

Actually, you did, but you were probably just lucky and got to take
advantage of the transparent Flash support that is in the open source
server code. Basically, its like this, Flash's XMLSocket class won't let
you send XML with open tags (so no &lt;stream:stream&gt;) without some hacking.
In addition, it tags a NULL onto the end if every piece of XML it sends.
Obviously, the protocol doesn't support a closed tag at the beginning of a
streamed document, and (IIRC) expat gets upset with that NULL character
when parsing XML (and I think it would disconnect the client).

The open source code has some logic built into it where it detects the
extra NULL character and the closed &lt;stream:stream&gt; header, and assumes
you are using Flash. For the rest of the conversation, it strips the NULL
for you.

The Flash support added by JINC for this purpose is more explict. Its
detailed by Jer in the 1.4.2 release documents.

Cheers,

bs.
