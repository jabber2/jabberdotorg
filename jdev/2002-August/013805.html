<PRE>My guess:

The problems are in the clients.  Jarl probably sent an unescaped '&gt;' 
character (which doesn't sound all that bad but it is probably against the 
XML spec), and all of the server components passed the data along as-is.

Another possibility is that Jarl sent correct XML, but one of the server 
components passed it along incorrectly (ie, parsed it ok, but then converted 
it back to text wrong).  Ask Adam to use a logger of sorts, to determine if 
it really was Jarl that sent the char unescaped.

Next, there is no excuse for a client to ever crash when receiving bogus data.  
This is likely the fault of Gabber's XML parser (which you claim is expat).  
A bug report to this client is in order.
