<PRE>For voice, I may agree somewhat, however there are times when even this 
is useful.  When you are blocked by firewalls, NAT, etc., it can be 
acceptable, especially when 8kb is tiny compared to available bandwidth.

A better use for bulk data through the Jabber server, for certain 
situations, would be for:

   * Video/Image snapshots  (Instant Images that I implemented at AOL)
   * Bulk data transfer (peer to peer, etc.)
   * Application to application XML traffic.

[Hi Jabber community, I'm back!  ;-)  Did I miss much??  ]
