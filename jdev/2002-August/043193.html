I just came back from an academic IS/IT conference in Dallas, where one 
presentation was on VoIP and Video Conf. using SIP for session 
initiation, as opposed to H.323. The speaker had a good side-by-side 
comparison of the two, and pointed that the &quot;bellheads&quot; seem to like 
H.323, while the &quot;netheads&quot; like SIP. He also pointed out that SIP 
appears to be the protocol of choice. SIP/Jabber interoperability or 
discovery and session initiaiton via SIP in the Jabber environment is 
definitely worth looking into.
