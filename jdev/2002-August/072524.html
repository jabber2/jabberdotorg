<PRE>C doesn't require NULL-terminated strings.  It's just that the standard
C string library assumes that strings end in NULL (since that method's
proven to be very effective for many applications).  There are plenty
of enumerated-string libraries for C, and because strings aren't built
into the language, those libraries can be every bit as efficient as
the standard C routines (but then again, PASCAL people don't really
care much about efficiency, anyway ... if they did, they wouldn't be
PASCAL programmers, now, would they?).  If anything, one of C's sons
(that bastard created by Mr. Stroustrup) makes it rediculously easy
to use Unicode in the full UCS-32 format (or any of the other formats,
for that matter), by creating a new character data type, and using the
should've-been-in-STL basic_string template with that new UCS32Char type.
If you'd prefer to avoid leaving C (a very wise choice, IMHO), you can
use a wchar_t array ... or you can just stick with the extraordinarily
simple (and very compatible) UTF-8 :-)

As for alignment of structure elements, anything like that is guaranteed
to cause portability headaches.  If you really want to do it in C, you can
either fake it using character arrays, or use an inline assembly block.
Be aware that neither C nor PASCAL provides sufficient portability
when you try to do that kind of stuff, because that requirement by
definition violates any hopes of portability (which is not necessarily
bad, but it's worth considering nonetheless).  Also, the primary reason
for system-dependent alignment is efficiency.  If your 64-bit CPU has
to fetch two seperate 64-bit words just to get a 2-bit value, you're
losing lots of potential speed.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#129;6&#166;1We need to find some kind of encoding algorithm/API which converts Unicode

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#129;6&#166;1We need some kind of rendering mechanism has to make the mapping from

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#129;6&#166;1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#129;6&#166;1There are a couple of Microsoft APIs called MultiByteToWideChar and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CharToMultiByte
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#129;6&#166;1There is an Mlang API of Microsoft which has functions like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ConvertStringToUnicode and ConvertUnicodeToString (I think this is our best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bet. If we read this thoroughly we might be able to solve the problem)
