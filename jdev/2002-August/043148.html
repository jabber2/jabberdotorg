<PRE>Kei-

I induce from this question that you are planning, or currently working
on, a piece of software that will use DSPS. Since it is, currently, not a
finialized (or even draft) JEP, implementation may be premature. In fact,
there is still a lot of controversy surrounding JEP-0037, because many
users (myself included) find it to be an overly complicated solution for
the problem its trying to address. It seems (or, at least its my
understanding) that some of the authors of the JEP have diverent views on
what problem DSPS is trying to solve, and what the best approach is.

I would suggest holding off on any implementation until the Council has
made some decision on this JEP, which probably won't happen until the new
Council takes office sometime in the next few weeks.

Cheers,

bs.
