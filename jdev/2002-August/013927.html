&gt;<i> Hi Matthias.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry about the email. I looked through my inbox and didn't see anything 
</I>&gt;<i> about that from you, so I might have ended up accidentally deleting it 
</I>&gt;<i> with the spam (i get about 50+ a day).
</I>
Then you will have to put me in your personal Addres book, just kidding ;)

&gt;<i> My answer is that it would be great for this to be adopted beyond 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber, but right now it is built for the Jabber platform,so I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> feel bad about it having the name &quot;Jabber&quot; in it. When it becomes more 
</I>&gt;<i> widely adopted outside Jabber, hopefully someone will take the 
</I>&gt;<i> initiative to add in other icon-like things to the spec such as Avatars 
</I>&gt;<i> and Presence Icons, and rename it to something more general. Maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;gisp&quot;, then &quot;Generic Icon Style Package&quot;.   :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Why, sth. more general? That would make it unusable for irc, because 
they don't know &quot;presence&quot; nor &quot;avatars&quot;. I just wouldn't refer to 
Jabber within this JEP038 by naming it &quot;.jisp&quot;, because I think that 
this format could get a lot easier adopted in the world when nothing 
refers to Jabber, only some names of &quot;.gem&quot;s itself e.g. Rhymbox and 
Yabber theme (and in the future probably some others).

And Cbas (from Rhymbox) looked up the actual definition for a &quot;gem&quot; and 
it's: &quot;Anything of small size, or expressed within brief limits, which 
is regarded as a gem on account of its beauty or value, as a small 
picture, a verse of poetry, a witty or wise saying.&quot; Which would be 
really perfect.

greetings
mattias
I'll better start a conversation with Theo before this is having the 
beginning proportions again :D. I wouldn't want to be thrown of this 
list ;)...
