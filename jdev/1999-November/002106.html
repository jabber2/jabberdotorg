<PRE>Quoting <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jplooney-jabber at online.ie</A>:
&gt;<i>  Hi, I'm not really looking to be a Jabber developer just yet, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> working for a company that's creating an online community, and one of the
</I>&gt;<i> things we need is a decent instant messaging client. Jabber looks to
</I>&gt;<i> potentially be a rather excellent choice, so I've decided to look into it,
</I>&gt;<i> and see how much work it would be to implement and support it on our
</I>&gt;<i> systems.
</I>
  Jabber would be an excellent choice in your situation, primarly becouse of 
it's extensibility by the use of transports.  Virtually any data your looking 
to pipe can be handled.

&gt;<i>  Is Jabber in such a state that I'd be able to play about with it, and see
</I>&gt;<i> how it could fit into our big picture ? At the moment, I'm running into
</I>&gt;<i> little problems like &quot;what's this secret parameter I'm to pass to jserver?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - where is this info ? The source ?
</I>
  You've come in at a perfect time.  We've recently completed, and will soon 
publicly release, 0.7 final, which is a complete rewrite of the system.  It is 
now much faster due to the use of loadable libraries, and the capability for 
transports to use shared memory instead of socket access..  But I'm going off 
on technicaly details, aren't I..

  One of the final things we're cleaning up is documentation for questions such 
as these.  We'd ENCOURAGE questions like this onlist, as it's hard to write 
documentation at times on systems you know, to serve a userbase that doesn't.  
;-P

  To answer your question, the transports secret is located inside of etherxd's 
registry for the jserver transport.  If you used the default file locations 
during install, these would be located in /usr/local/etc/jabber.  Specifically, 
the secret jserver uses to connect to etherx is located in jserver.xml, under 
the 'transport' entry.  This is used to provide a *little* bit of security for 
the jserver connection, and sort of serves as jservers 'password' to the etherx 
daemon.

  If you have ANY other questions, please, feel free to ask.  It will only help 
us, so don't feel like you're being a nag while asking..
