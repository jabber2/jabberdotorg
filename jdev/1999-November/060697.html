</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On Wed, Nov 24, 1999 at 12:21:34PM +0000, John P. Looney mentioned:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  OK. Found the problem. The server was specified as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;hercules.fv.digiserve.ie&quot; in the jserver.xml file, but I was trying to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connect to it by specifying a user &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">foo at hercules</A>&quot; to cabbar.
</I>&gt;<i>   Ahh, I thought you where getting the errors in something etherxd or jserver, 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't know ytou mean you where actually able to connect.
</I>&gt;<i>   You can setup aliases to tell the server to look like 'hercules' as well as 
</I>&gt;<i> 'hercules.fv.digiserve.ie'.
</I>
 OK. Must do that. Don't want other poor users getting confused :)

 In the end I'd to use strace on etherxd to see that it was writing out an
error like &quot;Don't know server hercules...&quot; - no idea where it thought it
was writing it to - I don't think it was in any of the log files...

&gt;<i> &gt;  Alas, getting the rest of it working isn't easy either. At one stage I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to send and receive messages. I quit out of the clients, ctrl-c'd the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server, and nothing worked when I tryed to get it going again. I'm getting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lot of:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wed Nov 24 15:27:26 1999  debug/session:38 BASIC_LOOKUP:[0] 2, t=134702448,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; s=0, l=0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wed Nov 24 15:27:26 1999  debug/conn:96 no session found for this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection, dropping data
</I>&gt;<i>   When you control'c'd the server, did it completely exit?
</I>
 etherxd you mean ? Yes, very sure. Dead as roadkill that's starting to
smell funny.

 Ah. Another clue. Etherxd is saying:
Wed Nov 24 16:00:48 1999  debug/auth:90 SVC_BASIC: auth result illegal/Invalid Authentication Query

 However the password/username is definitly correct, and the cabbar client
thinks it's being logged in...these logins were working earlier. Bar
./jabber-transport/var/jabber, is there any data files kept around that
could have been corrupted (except the xml files) ?
