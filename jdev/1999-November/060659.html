Actually it isn't fine. People behind firewalls and proxies, for instance,
have no way of being able to chat with other people.

&gt;<i> Yahoo, AOL, ICQ...they all do it like this (well the only one I have inside

Hmm, I thought AOL was totally client-server based. ICQ allows peer-peer,
but it honestly only works for me about 40% of the time.. and the
different allowable rules between peer-peer and server sending (such as an
imposed message size limit on sending through the server) is very
annoying. End users should not have to deal with that sort of thing.

Also, for interoperability with other systems, it is nice to have the
backend of the jabber server handle all the other protocols, rather than
having to hack some manner of support for AOL, ICQ, Yahoo, MSN, PowWow (am
I forgetting any big ones? I know I am forgetting at least ten small
ones like EGM) into each and every client.
