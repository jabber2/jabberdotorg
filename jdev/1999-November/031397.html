<PRE>On Tue, Nov 23, 1999 at 12:39:01PM -0600, Thomas Charron mentioned:
&gt;<i>   Jabber would be an excellent choice in your situation, primarly becouse of 
</I>&gt;<i> it's extensibility by the use of transports.  Virtually any data your looking 
</I>&gt;<i> to pipe can be handled.
</I>
 That's the important bit - we are trying to integrate a browser chat
engine, IM service &amp; loads of other components. Jabber could fit in -
that's what I'm supposed to be finding out this week :)

&gt;<i>   You've come in at a perfect time.  We've recently completed, and will soon 
</I>&gt;<i> publicly release, 0.7 final, which is a complete rewrite of the system.  It is 
</I>&gt;<i> now much faster due to the use of loadable libraries, and the capability for 
</I>&gt;<i> transports to use shared memory instead of socket access..  But I'm going off 
</I>&gt;<i> on technicaly details, aren't I..
</I>
 That's cool. I appriciate it! I'm working off CVS at the moment - it seems
fairly different to the 0.6 release alright....

&gt;<i>   One of the final things we're cleaning up is documentation for questions such 
</I>&gt;<i> as these.  We'd ENCOURAGE questions like this onlist, as it's hard to write 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation at times on systems you know, to serve a userbase that doesn't.  
</I>&gt;<i> ;-P
</I>
 Right. Here's something you don't have straight off. A &quot;What to edit&quot;
quickstart guide. I've been poking around the xml config files for a few
hours, and sorta know what's what. 

&gt;<i>   To answer your question, the transports secret is located inside of etherxd's 
</I>&gt;<i> registry for the jserver transport.  If you used the default file locations 
</I>&gt;<i> during install, these would be located in /usr/local/etc/jabber.  Specifically, 
</I>&gt;<i> the secret jserver uses to connect to etherx is located in jserver.xml, under 
</I>&gt;<i> the 'transport' entry.  This is used to provide a *little* bit of security for 
</I>&gt;<i> the jserver connection, and sort of serves as jservers 'password' to the etherx 
</I>&gt;<i> daemon.
</I>
 Excellent. I now see why etherxd was including the jserver.xml file.

 However, I still can't get the jserver to start. Started with the -D
option it gives:

% jserver -D -s bing
[..deleted..]
Tue Nov 23 18:47:39 1999  debug/tstream:153 tstream read event
Tue Nov 23 18:47:39 1999  debug/xmlstream:196 _xmlstream_main
Tue Nov 23 18:47:39 1999  debug/tstream:153 tstream read event
Tue Nov 23 18:47:39 1999  error/tstream error reading from socket '127.0.0.1'
Tue Nov 23 18:47:39 1999  error/libetherx unable to estabilsh connection to etherx, forcing exit
% 

 And etherxd -D says nothing that could be interpreted as an error message.
Any ideas ?
