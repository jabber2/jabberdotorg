<PRE>Thanks Mark and Dov for your help.

I got the JGF (that is on SF but that was not found last time I was
looking for it... SF requests overflow?) and I had a look at it. It
seems easy to use (I think every useful things are in RemoteConnection
class) and your implementation proposal should suit me well.

But in fact, I have some problems that I cannot sort out:
- the SMS users should be located (and visible) in a chat room (but
there are too numerous to get one persistant XMPP connection per user)
but they do not need to receive chat room messages if they do not want
to.
- the SMS users could become XMPP users (thanks to a wap interface for
example) and, in this case, they must not receive SMS messages.
Moreover, during this transformation, they must keep their user's
settings such as chat room location.

I am thinking about this (because I want to replace our old and complex
application) but if you have any idea about this, do not hesitate to
contact me ;)

Seb
