</I>
If Mattias decides to do a GPL only release that is no problem. With dual  
licencing, at any time you can decide to &quot;fork&quot; the codebase and go on  
with a GPL only version. You do not have to have ownership of the code for  
that. So I guess what it comes down to is, does anyone use or care about  
Jabberd1.4 being JOSL?

Ofcourse, Jamin could always decide to do this himself, but then he'd have  
to remove the JOSL licence every time there is a new release (you could  
probably script that).

Note that, whoever publishes anything under JOSL will still be bound under  
those terms. However this weird requirment is probably void if you publish  
packages that include the source (which Mattias does probably, just a  
tarball with the source). So to make the life of packagers like Jamin  
easier, if I were Mattias I would go with GPL only from now, unless  
someone desperatly needs JOSL.
