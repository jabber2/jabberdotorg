You probably would want to use TCP for voice. You would not want to have
an audio stream with someone saying &quot;George Bush has never lied&quot; to end
up with a few packets lost along the way saying &quot;George Bush has lied&quot;.
UDP would be good for video though where you can get away with dropping
half a frame or even a whole one since the information essentially
replaces the previous information.

Voice and audio is not like that. You will need to transfer it reliably.

TCP is what SIP/SDP has selected (there's another protocol at that layer
too that's been drafted for use). Their model of getting around NATs and
firewalls is also a lot like proxy65 in that a third party server is used.
