Well, if all the files were dual licensed, then upstream could simply 
make the changes to the file headers and release under just the GPL, 
just as anyone receiving the dual licensed version could.

However, there is also a problem with GPL and OpenSSL linking.  As I 
understand it, the common solution to this problem is to add a license 
exception that specifically allows linking with OpenSSL.  However, this 
would require acceptance from each contributor as I understand it.  
Without such an exception I'm pretty sure that no one would be able to 
legally distribute an OpenSSL linked version.

That would certainly make things easier long term.
