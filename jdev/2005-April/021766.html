<PRE>The JECL library has been folded into a more comprehensive set of APIs that 
Jabber, Inc. offers commercially now. If you still have a copy of what was 
called JECL back then, of course you can continue to use it under the JOSL 
license.

If you are a customer of Jabber, Inc., your sales or support contact can get 
you the latest version. If not, we don't currently have plans to re-release 
those libraries as open source at this time. That is something we might 
consider again in the future, but is not in the current roadmap, since 
components written against our libraries end up more tightly integrated with 
XCP than we think the open source community might want.

One of the differences is that back when we first released JECL, there 
weren't as many good open source options for developing Jabber software in 
C++, so we felt an obligation to the community to give them some options. 
Now, there are other choices, so we've taken our libraries a different 
direction.

I know this may be disappointing to some, and perhaps we haven't 
communicated information on this topic well enough to everyone. Sorry for 
that.

Let me know if you have any questions.
