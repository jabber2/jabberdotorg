<PRE>Hi Remko,
Even if P2P IM could be interesting, it is something different than XMPP 
(according with current specifications, it is basically a client server 
protocol; of course everything can be changed).
My opinion is that, more than adding another connection mechanism, it 
would be better to improve the services built on it (that is what can 
make an xmpp/jabber solution really appealing).

P2P messaging is of interest only in small organizations, where there is 
just a single LAN: if you google around, you can find a lot of software 
based on the so-hated NETBIOS that meet the goals to be &quot;serverless&quot; and 
&quot;selfconfiguring&quot;.

The lack of a single point of administration in P2P solutions leads 
bigger companies to like a client-server approach, as that of XMPP; even 
in such a scenario, zeroconf could improve xmpp adoption as I said in my 
email (at least according with the opinions of two companies developing 
commercial solutions upon jabber, like Jivesoftware and Tipic).

PS. Actually, the zeroconf part is really simple, since you can download 
the mDNSRisponder SDK from Apple site and use it in your software. The 
hard part is beeing sure that everybody is who he claims to be, since 
there isn't an external entity (the server) that assures for that.

Bye,
    Francesco
