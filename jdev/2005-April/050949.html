AFAIK, there is no such component available as open source. There may be
some commercial SMS transports but of course they are not free....

The Jabber Gateway Framework might have helped, but I don't think any
code was ever released for it.

You might check out JSO if you want to do component development in Java:

<A HREF="http://jso.jabberstudio.org/">http://jso.jabberstudio.org/</A>

No. SMS doesn't know anything about CPIM. You would simply do the
transformation directly from XMPP to SMS.

&gt;<i> , contacts that could help me, or anything else that could help me
</I>&gt;<i> to start...
</I>
Keep asking questions on this list, look at some of the existing
gateway projects, etc. If you're not wedded to Java, C, or C++, you
might think about writing it in Python using the Twisted libraries,
which seem to be quite popular for writing components and gateways
(PyMSNt, PyAIMt, etc.).
