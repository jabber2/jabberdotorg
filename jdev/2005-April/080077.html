The advertising clause right? Well there are a few things you can do. From  
easy and not so legal to perfectly legal with a lot of effort.

- not care cause it's unlikely the OpenSSL team cares. Ofcourse, Debian  
etc. cares..
- not distribute with OpenSSL, dynamically link against it. If OpenSSL is  
considered &quot;part of the operating system&quot; this is legal, not everyone  
agrees with that though.
- put in the OpenSSL advertising clause. It's not a crime to credit them.   
Still GPL puritans will care.
- put a &quot;special exception&quot; for linking against OpenSSL in the license.  
Just put it there, don't tell anyone ;) Hope you don't upset anyone.
- the above, but the &quot;legal&quot; way. Ask every contributer to the current  
codebase (wether is was under GPL or under JOSL) for permission to do that.
- Haress the OpenSSL people to drop the advertising clause. (how legal  
this is depends on your method of haressing)
- Dump OpenSSL in favor of GNU TLS or something else GPL (compatible).
- Drop GPL and go with JOSL only license ;)
