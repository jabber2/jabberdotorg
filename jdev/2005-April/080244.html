<PRE>SALIBI Samir RD-BIZZ-ISS a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am interested in J-EAI solution and I would like to have more informations about the using of XMPP in J-EAI solution. I already downloaded and read your presentation of February 2005. Could you tell me why you chose XMPP and what is its really job in the J-EAI solution ? 
</I>
XMPP is an open standard that allow to integrate software written in any 
langage. The protocol is very simple and extensible. The hard work is 
done on the server part and we have been using J-EAI to integrate with 
very lightweigh client were heavy processing is not an option. Opening a 
socket and sending and reading XML is simple and works on every terminal.

Moreover, there are a lot of JEP (such as publish and subscribe) that 
are really making the XMPP protocol a nice basis for a generic messaging 
and integration platform. We are currently working on JEP-0060 extension 
(prototyping to see if our ideas are usefull).

Our approach relies on the Erlang language which allows us to develop a 
clustered and highly reliable platform.

Please, contact me directly if you want more details, but what I can 
tell is that, so far, we are *really* very happy with the result.

Cheers,
