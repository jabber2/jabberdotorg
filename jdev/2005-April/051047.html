<PRE>&gt;<i> I don't know about that. Server side storage as defined in JEP-0049 does

Cool well thought through, my thinking when writing this was that when a 
client makes changes to the bookmarks it could notify all its other 
resources of this change using maybe JEP-0050 or some new protocol that we 
invent, this makes it nice and simple.

Other thoughts that I had were that you could store this &quot;bookmarks&quot; list in 
pubsub and then when that is updated you get notified, although like you I 
did realise after that that the pubsub update notification would only go to 
the highest priority client which kind of makes it useless, what you really 
need to be able to do is have pubsub be able to send notifications to all of 
your resources at once, not sure how tho.
