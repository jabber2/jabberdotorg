</I>&gt;<i> You should do this with a modified PubSub server. Take a look at Section

</I>&gt;<i> you can use it. It probably doesn't quite suit you just yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, then look up just a bit in section 8.2. It states:  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Implementations SHOULD use the Data Forms protocol to allow the node  
</I>&gt;<i> owner to accomplish the configuration&quot;. A long while ago by now, it took  
</I>&gt;<i> me a long discussion with some of the people involved in making this JEP  
</I>&gt;<i> to change that into the SHOULD it is today from the MUST it used to be.  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm glad to see a real use case for what I was thinking of at the time. I  
</I>&gt;<i> still think MAY is better than SHOULD, but it should work now too.
</I>
Yes, I was a proponent of this as well, in that discussion. However, it
seems the JEP-0060 schema doesn't allow other namespaces then x:data. This
is probably an error, and I'll take this up with the (other) authors.

&gt;<i> What this means is that now, you can use ANY XML format to configure your  
</I>&gt;<i> node. In this case, GeoPriv XML. As you can see, modifying a PubSub can be  
</I>&gt;<i> done in a protocol compliant way, by making a Geopriv JEP. You can also  
</I>&gt;<i> make it work for everyone by running just one modified pubsub server.
</I>
I'm not sure about other implementations, but I specifically designed Idavoll,
my pubsub service implementation, to allow other business rules, depending
on the target application. Maybe you could use it as a start for building out
your application. See <A HREF="http://idavoll.jabberstudio.org/">http://idavoll.jabberstudio.org/</A> or contact me privately
via Jabber (prefered! JID: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">ralphm at ik.nu</A>) or E-mail.

&gt;<i> Since you might want to send &quot;normal&quot; configuration data as well (eg  
</I>&gt;<i> access control) I think JEP-0060 should better show that it's possible to  
</I>&gt;<i> have two or more &lt;configure/&gt; nodes during creation. Also, to be sure I'd  
</I>&gt;<i> take a look at the schema of the JEP to see if it is properly in line with  
</I>&gt;<i> what the JEP allows as I've described.
</I>
This is not needed. You can have more than one child in &lt;configure/&gt;.
