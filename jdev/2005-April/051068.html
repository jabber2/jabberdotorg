I don't actually know that the JECL files were ever officially 
licensed under the JOSL. There was, I believe, the intent to do 
that, and binaries were provided on the road to doing so, but I'll 
need to do some research into the matter to determine whether the 
code files were ever actually licensed under the JOSL. So I will
look into that and report my findings back to the list. The same
applies to the old SCM code.
