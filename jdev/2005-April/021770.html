My concern is with point #2 in the JOSL's preamble that states that
source code will be available. I'm not a lawyer, but if you license a
library under the JOSL you must release the source of that library too.
Something that was never done with JECL, and has been a constant
question that I've had since I feel that I have a right to the source
code of the binaries that were distributed. Perhaps I don't have a right
and need to be corrected.
