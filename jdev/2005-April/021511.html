I'm not sure I follow you here.  I'm not aware of anything in the GPL 
that allows someone to not credit the original authors.  In fact 
section 1 of the GPL states:

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source 
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice 
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to 
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the 
Program.

I think the key portion here is &quot;an appropriate copyright notice&quot;.  
Regardless of the GPL or MIT/BSD license I'm pretty sure it's illegal 
for someone to take a work originally authored (and thus copyrighted) 
by someone else and remove that copyright.  Since the copyright /must/ 
remain, credit is given.  Section 3 of the license attempts to ensure 
the availability of the software source, thus the copyright statements 
are viewable.
