<PRE>&gt;<i> Gaim puts &quot;jabber:x:delay&quot; information in presence... why couldn't it
</I>&gt;<i> put a voip-uri?
</I>
As far as I know it is actually the server that puts that into the presence 
packet, but the delay information (letting the other client know when the 
presence was actually set) is a very different matter from including voip 
info so im not quite sure why you brought this into the mix????, the delay 
extension fits there perfectly because it is relevant to that presence 
stanza, whereas your voip uri extension is not and as even you have stated 
it has nothing to do with the IM presence.

&gt;<i> I don't see where the security issue is... all of your contacts can send
</I>&gt;<i> you messages anytime they want and you don't consider it a security
</I>&gt;<i> issue ; but allowing the same contacts to call you is one?!
</I>
Urm the security issue is that people that are not part of the voip session 
have the voip URI which could allow them to potensially extract the IP from 
that (which is usually not known by anyone else in jabber) and then DDOS 
your machine (or practically anything now that they have your IP address) or 
even connect to the session and listen in (if the voip software had lax 
security) when they shouldnt be.

&gt;<i> I'm studying the pubsub jep so I can't comment about it yet.
</I>
If you really are intent on doing this then using pubsub is your only option 
if you want your proposal standardised, I dont see it ever being passed by 
the council if you do it as a presence extension, and I doubt the gaim folks 
would accept any implementation of it into their main codebase if it has 
been rejected by the council.
