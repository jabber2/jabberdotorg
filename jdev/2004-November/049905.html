<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Ah ok then, well I would suggest you read up more on Jabber by reading 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RFCs, JEPs etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in the process of doing so, but notice:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. There's much to read ;
</I>
Yes but everyone here has had to do it at one time or another, and as I say 
if you dont you will just end up wasting your time by doing things the wrong 
way.

&gt;<i> Well, the patch I made for gaim is simple: you set an uri in your
</I>&gt;<i> preferences, and it gets sent with your presence. So if you look at it
</I>&gt;<i> this way, it's not dubious: it's just wrong. But if you consider the
</I>&gt;<i> grand scheme of having the voip client able to notify that you're
</I>&gt;<i> already on a call, or in do-not-disturb mode ; then really that's
</I>&gt;<i> presence, and it's not so dubious.
</I>
It is still very dubious IMO, presence is only intended for information that 
all of your contacts will always be interested in (if its only useful for a 
limited amount of your contacts then you need to be using pubsub), the fact 
your are in a VoIP call is not going to be useful to many people, and if 
this is all you are really using this for then its complete overkill and a 
waste of bandwidth to tell other contacts the url of the call when its of no 
use to them, all you really would need to do was change your presence to 
&quot;dnd&quot; and &quot;On the Phone&quot;, you are not supposed to be expressing 
do-not-disturb with a VoIP extension since the presence stuff already has 
&quot;dnd&quot; stuff built in.

&gt;<i> So in short: it really is presence, even if the sample implementation I
</I>&gt;<i> have doesn't make it clear.
</I>
Urm as you can see above its not really presence and it has not real use as 
far as presence goes, as someone has already said your extension should be 
in message or in iq and only sent specifically to people who need it, i.e. 
people you are wanting to invite into a VoIP call.

&gt;&gt;<i> So what I would suggest as your first step is read and try to understand 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol layed out in the RFCs and the JEPs, and before you go creating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything new double check the JEPs/RFCs to see if what you are trying to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has already been done or not, if it is at the development stages I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggest contacting the author of the JEPs in question and providing your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feedback on it to try and help out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really want to develop on jabber ; I just want to be able to use
</I>&gt;<i> it, and probably needs advice on this.
</I>
If you dont want to develop then dont and leave this to someone who does, if 
all you want to do is use VoIP with gaim then ask the gaim developers to add 
this support into their client, they will then be able to integrate this 
correctly and inline with jabber standards.
