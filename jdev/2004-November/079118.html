Wrong.  If a certificate remains unchanged, then you know that as long as 
it is unchanged, you're continuing to connect to the server you connected 
to in the past.

You can't know if there's a man-in-the-middle in progress when you first 
connect, but if you're remembering certificate and someone tries one after 
a while, you will be able to detect that.

ssh does this, for example.

Also, remember that different people have different threat models to 
address.  Someone in the old hypothetical revolutionary conspiracy can't 
afford to depend on large institutional corporations to sign their 
certificates, but still might want to protect their communications from 
eavesdropping.
