You're absolutely right.  I wasn't discussing caching.

That said, on the subject of caching, XMPP servers should be a bit more strict 
than most of us probably are with ssh, if only to curb spam.  Using dialback 
on the first connection might be acceptable.

And now that I think about it, the whole &quot;use dialback for the first 
connection, SASL EXTERNAL for all after&quot; concept would be a good way to 
optimize s2s.
