Err, except to have a certificate issued means that your public key
has been verified as being from you - verisign for instance never sees
your private key. They only see what they would get anyway by
connecting to the socket you are running on.

There is a lot more risk in trusting a self-signed certificate as a
CA, since that certificate can then be used to generate certificates
for any other domain.
