You don't need to know the SIP uri to know that a client has one. You only  
need to advertise that you have one. If you want to receive SIP calls  
enable it, if you don't disable it. Or as JEP-115 puts it &quot;Some clients  
will have bundles of functionality that can be enabled and disabled.&quot;  
Doesn't sound very against the spirit of JEP-115.

Once you want to intitiate your SIP conversation you retrieve the URI. The  
mechanism for this, well that will depend on your requirments. You could  
define a simple IQ request for an x:oob packet (this should appeal to you  
if you think security is important, since you could send an error if you  
don't want to share). But an argument could be made for putting it in  
disco or vcard-temp, since that would enable offline retrival.

What's the case for pubsub anyway? It's not dynamic.. in fact, I don't  
even *want* the uri to be updated, *unless* I put in a call. Such a  
message would be just as much &quot;polluting&quot; to the network as putting your  
SIP uri in the presence. The only thing I can imagine you want this  
dynamic is &quot;I have it&quot; or &quot;I don't have it&quot;.

Ofcourse, this could mean we'll end up in the larger discussion.. is  
JEP-0115 a good idea or just a presence hack to fix the flaws of Disco  
like iChat and avatars? Why doesn't this use pubsub other than the well  
know reasons &quot;there's no good pubsub server out there, no client supports  
it etc.&quot; for example?
