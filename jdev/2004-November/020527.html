<PRE>Hi there,

I don't know if this could be off-topic because it has something to do with
karma / proxy technology in general but I think developers are aware of this
as well.

Well, I'm currently working on a Jabber Client which is designed to transmit
any kind of data. Actually, I'm using Jep47 (In-Band-Bytestreams) for 
sending
data which works fine.
Lately, I'm working on proxy support and the proxy connection (Socks5,
Http connect and http-polling) works good - I'm able to login and chat.

However, I'm having big trouble when sending larger files via such a
proxy connection. Sending 11kb of data works in most cases but any bigger
data doesn't because I loose the proxy connection.
When I send a larger amount of data, my program sends packet by packet
and at the end of the transfer I lose the connection to the proxy and my
program reconnects...but all the packets are lost!

My assumption is that this has something todo with the karma setting of the
jabber server. I did the same tests with a local jabber server (by using the
same proxy server) where karma is disabled and it worked pretty fine.
It could also depend on a timeout..I mean, the connection from a local squid
proxy to a local jabberd is much faster than using the internet...

Anyway, I don't have any conclusion why I lose the proxy connection when
sending a larger amount of data. When using a direct connection (without
any proxy) with a karma'ed server, I don't have any problems at all.

Any ideas? It could be a problem of my implementation but what could cause
it?

Many thanks in advance.

Cheers,
Oliver Hohlfeld
