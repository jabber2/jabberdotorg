Obviously the private key is kept secret when the public key is signed.  My 
point is that if one's adversary has influence over the CA, one is wise to 
avoid all contact with the CA.

I don't pay attention to CAs.  I have no reason to trust them, because as 
you say, a CA must be trusted not just to be who it says it is, but to be 
perfect in its evaluation of others' identity.  There's no agency in the 
world I could trust that well.

Because of that, I get a little concerned when people insist that the magic 
of a CA makes TLS work, or that without one TLS is worthless.
