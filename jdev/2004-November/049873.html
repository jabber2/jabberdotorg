<PRE>Mark,

I did it awhile back, it could have been my posts you were reading. I don't
think it was necessary to use php or anything like that. I do, but for other
things. Eventually I got an account with dreamhost and a flashcom account
with influxis and things work acceptably. (dreamhost because they run jabber
servers so I don't have to, and influxis for the flashcom server).

I went with svg for the graphics of the client. I think I made it transfer
mp3s and jpgs too, if I remember correctly. When last I left off I had
&quot;ported&quot; it to Central and the new Central 1.5 has file access built in, so
that shouldn't really be a problem anymore, of course using Central takes
away from the web-based aspect but still, it provides a convenient shell to
give jabber file transfer (when coupled with the Flashcom server).

Also integrated the &quot;Alicebot&quot; into the thing, and a voice xml server so
that you could use a telephone and voice recognition to cause the Alicebot
to reply through Jabber to effect a jabber/telephone &quot;conversation&quot;.
Eventually I was able to connect it all to the X10 home automation system so
that you could use Jabber to turn off lights at a remote location, with a
telephone as part of the chain. As long as there was a camera and/or
microphone in play I figured I'd write a few things and devised a system to
sense movement or noise and respond to it in certain ways. I did set up a
few systems for handicapped people, which was my goal. More recently I've
been working on other things but I still read the mailing lists.

I tried a few times to get some sort of exchange going on how best to
integrate the jabber protocol when multimedia was an option - there wasn't
much interest.

Greg.

Subject: [jdev] Audio and video


Has anyone seen a GPL version of flashcom audio/video being used with
jabber?
I read on here someone had made one awhile back.
If not what would be the best way to intergrate flashcom and action script
with jabber?
Would it be like perl/php or like javascript?
Or would it be more like c and Java?


Mark
