<PRE>Le mardi 30 novembre 2004 &#224; 09:28 +0000, Richard Dobson a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Ah ok then, well I would suggest you read up more on Jabber by reading 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; RFCs, JEPs etc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm in the process of doing so, but notice:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. There's much to read ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes but everyone here has had to do it at one time or another, and as I say 
</I>&gt;<i> if you dont you will just end up wasting your time by doing things the wrong 
</I>&gt;<i> way.
</I>
I'm not sure asking everyone to read everything to solve specific
problems is really sound...

&gt;<i> &gt; Well, the patch I made for gaim is simple: you set an uri in your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preferences, and it gets sent with your presence. So if you look at it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this way, it's not dubious: it's just wrong. But if you consider the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grand scheme of having the voip client able to notify that you're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already on a call, or in do-not-disturb mode ; then really that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presence, and it's not so dubious.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is still very dubious IMO, presence is only intended for information that 
</I>&gt;<i> all of your contacts will always be interested in (if its only useful for a 
</I>&gt;<i> limited amount of your contacts then you need to be using pubsub), the fact 
</I>&gt;<i> your are in a VoIP call is not going to be useful to many people, and if 
</I>&gt;<i> this is all you are really using this for then its complete overkill and a 
</I>&gt;<i> waste of bandwidth to tell other contacts the url of the call when its of no 
</I>&gt;<i> use to them, all you really would need to do was change your presence to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dnd&quot; and &quot;On the Phone&quot;, you are not supposed to be expressing 
</I>&gt;<i> do-not-disturb with a VoIP extension since the presence stuff already has 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dnd&quot; stuff built in.
</I>
No: when I'm DnD for IM, then certainly I'm DnD for VoIP (also known as
&quot;away&quot;). But when I'm in a voip call, I'm certainly still able to read
IM messages: this is a presence information, and it can't be guessed
from the IM presence.

&gt;<i> &gt; So in short: it really is presence, even if the sample implementation I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have doesn't make it clear.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Urm as you can see above its not really presence and it has not real use as 
</I>&gt;<i> far as presence goes, as someone has already said your extension should be 
</I>&gt;<i> in message or in iq and only sent specifically to people who need it, i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> people you are wanting to invite into a VoIP call.
</I>
I'm not convinced it isn't presence, as discussed above. And since it is
presence, I should be able to call my contact right away, not invite
him/her. Just like once we accepted each other, we're able to send
messages to each other right away...

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So what I would suggest as your first step is read and try to understand 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; protocol layed out in the RFCs and the JEPs, and before you go creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; anything new double check the JEPs/RFCs to see if what you are trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; has already been done or not, if it is at the development stages I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; suggest contacting the author of the JEPs in question and providing your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; feedback on it to try and help out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't really want to develop on jabber ; I just want to be able to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it, and probably needs advice on this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you dont want to develop then dont and leave this to someone who does, if 
</I>&gt;<i> all you want to do is use VoIP with gaim then ask the gaim developers to add 
</I>&gt;<i> this support into their client, they will then be able to integrate this 
</I>&gt;<i> correctly and inline with jabber standards.
</I>
I thought I had been precise enough: my main motivation is to develop
some convenient and clean way to enable voip in gaim using jabber.
Reading jabber documentation is a mean towards the goal, not the goal
himself. I'm not saying &quot;I don't want to develop&quot;.

I think the jabber:x:oob trick is both standard -- and respects the
spirit of what presence should be.
