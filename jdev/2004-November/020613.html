<PRE>Le lundi 29 novembre 2004 &#224; 15:07 +0000, Richard Dobson a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Ah ok then, well I would suggest you read up more on Jabber by reading the 
</I>&gt;<i> RFCs, JEPs etc
</I>
I'm in the process of doing so, but notice:
1. There's much to read ;
2. There are JEPs that say they are obsolete, but don't say what
obsoletes them!

&gt;<i>  before diving in and hacking away otherwise you will risk 
</I>&gt;<i> wasting your efforts as you seem to have by creating solutions to problems 
</I>&gt;<i> that have already been solved,
</I>

&gt;<i>  or simply not following the protocol 
</I>&gt;<i> standards
</I>
This is mostly what I want to avoid.

&gt;<i>  and again wasting your time and effort, i.e. you created an 
</I>&gt;<i> illegal extension to presence (illegal because it is not namespaced),
</I>
Obviously I wouldn't ask if I had thought it was ok.

&gt;<i>  and its dubious anyway because the extension you are trying to create does not 
</I>&gt;<i> seem to relate to presence and thus should not even be there in the first 
</I>&gt;<i> place.
</I>
Well, the patch I made for gaim is simple: you set an uri in your
preferences, and it gets sent with your presence. So if you look at it
this way, it's not dubious: it's just wrong. But if you consider the
grand scheme of having the voip client able to notify that you're
already on a call, or in do-not-disturb mode ; then really that's
presence, and it's not so dubious.

So in short: it really is presence, even if the sample implementation I
have doesn't make it clear.

&gt;<i> So what I would suggest as your first step is read and try to understand the 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol layed out in the RFCs and the JEPs, and before you go creating 
</I>&gt;<i> anything new double check the JEPs/RFCs to see if what you are trying to do 
</I>&gt;<i> has already been done or not, if it is at the development stages I would 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest contacting the author of the JEPs in question and providing your 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback on it to try and help out.
</I>
I don't really want to develop on jabber ; I just want to be able to use
it, and probably needs advice on this.
