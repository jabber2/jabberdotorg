</I>
By &quot;decentralised&quot;, I really just mean it has no centre - there aren't any
special, or especially privileged, servers.

XMPP fits this description, but not all services built on XMPP do - for
example, if we had a single user directory (and I think one such did exist
at one point) that would be a centralised service.

Matrix has identity servers, which are a centralised trusted naming
service, DNS is similarly centralised (due to the root service).

In neither case are the &quot;centralised&quot; servers a single entity; they're just
a privileged set, providing a distributed service.

Of course, these all assume actual servers, and a service defined in terms
of a simple protocol. For a particularly odd example, consider PKIX, where
we have multiple, fully independent, Certification Authorities forming a
heterogeneous privileged set of providers - PKIX is clearly not
decentralised, but has multiple central points...


&gt;<i>         - distributed: 1 server = 1 user, no intermediate (not even DNS,
</I>&gt;<i> so XMPP is not distributed according to this definition, but something like
</I>&gt;<i> retroshare is)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Your definition fits what people tend to mean by &quot;peer to peer&quot;, although
s/user/device/.

Almost anything can be described as distributed.

It might mean a service which is available equivalently at multiple points
on the network. Which really doesn't say anything useful.

It might mean a service which is provided equivalently by multiple points
on the network; that's a slightly tighter definition, but covers clustered
XMPP servers, for example.

I suspect people usually intend to mean a service which is provided
equivalently by a decentralized set of providers, and in extremis they can
mean peer to peer.

Well, no.

People usually seem to mean &quot;whatever it is that we do&quot;, and use it
liberally on marketing brochures.


&gt;<i>         - federated: the ability from servers of different domains (
</I>&gt;<i> example.net and capulet.lit) to talk together, in both directions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, or more generally, the ability for multiple disparate administrative
domains to intercommunicate on an equal basis.


&gt;<i> But after a talk I realise that the definitions accepted is not the same
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere, e.g. Diaspora people talk about federation for what I call
</I>&gt;<i> decentralisation. Actualy it's a bit tricky, because if one entity has 1000
</I>&gt;<i> servers but everybody is using the same domain, the data are centralised in
</I>&gt;<i> the hands of the same entity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what meaning do you put behind these words ? Are decentralisation and
</I>&gt;<i> federation more or less synonyms ?
