<PRE>Dunno if this ever got through, so here it is again:

Hi Matthias.

When i looked in the jabber.xml file, i found out that it was pointing
to /jabber//usrblabla.. So i deleted my jabber folders, installed the
jabber server again with --prefix/jabber (instead of --prefix=/jabber/),
and now it doesent come with the long debug info as before,
unfortunately only with:
--------
Starting program: /jabber/bin/jabberd 
20070315T19:17:22: [notice] (-internal): initializing server

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00000011 in ?? ()
(gdb) quit
The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y
[<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">root at localhost</A> bin]# 
-----------

So now the server doesent crash when i try to register a user, it just,
halts or what you call it. I can make other connections, but it doesent
give me an id, neither does it care what i send to it, it just ignores
it. 

Ive made sure that my folders had the rights it should be, by giving all
permissions:
chmod 777 -R /jabber
and
chmod 777 -R /usr/local/jabber

Its the same.

I think i might have been drunk or something when i came up with that
subject, im using jabberd 1.4.4 :)

Well i feel like im doin progress here, thanks to you!

Hope you can help with that tiny bit of debug info..

Regards
/Lars


&gt;<i> &gt; this time it is no problem in libpth ... the backtrace shows what
</I>&gt;<i> the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; executable just did when it crashed ... the names (e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;xdb_file_phandler&quot;) there refer to the functions that have called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other. Every function is called by the function below it. Therefore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last known function call before your server crashed is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; xdb_file_phandler() which is defined in xdb_file.c. There at line
</I>&gt;<i> 291 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your computer tried to call something else that crashed ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Which version of jabberd are you exactly using? (It can't be
</I>&gt;<i> jabberd 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.4.1 as we have in the subject.) So I can check the right version
</I>&gt;<i> of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this file to see where your problem exists. But I'd expect that
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some problem to access the file spool of your server. Check that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory you have configured in your jabber.xml configuration file 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using the &lt;spool/&gt; element does exist and is read- and writeable by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user that is running the jabber server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Matthias
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
