<PRE>Hi Lars!

You might not feel like that, but you went a step further. It's now left 
to solve the problem that your libpth installation does not seem to be 
in a path where your system's dynamic loder is expecting it.

As Norman said, you have to find out where libpth is installed and to 
configure your system'S dynamic loader to find it there.

This might be done system wide by adding the correct path to the 
directory where you find libpth.so to /etc/ld.so.conf and afterwards 
running ldconfig. Or you might also add additional paths where the 
dynamic loader searches for libraries by defining the environment 
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
&gt;<i> If i run it inside gdb:

</I>&gt;<i> Starting program: /jabber/bin/jabberd jabberd

</I>&gt;<i> Program exited with code 0177.
</I>&gt;<i> (gdb) 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Am i doin anything wrong here? Or doesent it seem like pth isnt

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
As I said: you have now solved one of your problems. gdb now was 
successfully able to load the jabberd binary. It's just that your system 
was not able to load all required library files (DLLs in the terms of 
Windows).

&gt;<i> As said, im aint that familiar with these linux tools, so bare over with
</I>&gt;<i> me :)  But i really appreciate your help!!
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
The relevant utilities here might be &quot;ldconfig&quot; (which recreates the 
locations the dynamic linker searches for libraries from the 
/etc/ld.so.conf file) and &quot;ldd &lt;executable to check&gt;&quot; which can be used 
to check if the system finds all requires libraries and where they are 
loaded from.
