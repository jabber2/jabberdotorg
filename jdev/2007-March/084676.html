<PRE>Hi Matthias.

When i looked in the jabber.xml file, i found out that it was pointing
to /jabber//usrblabla.. So i deleted my jabber folders, installed the
jabber server again with --prefix/jabber (instead of --prefix=/jabber/),
and now it doesent come with the long debug info as before,
unfortunately only with:
--------
Starting program: /jabber/bin/jabberd 
20070315T19:17:22: [notice] (-internal): initializing server

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00000011 in ?? ()
(gdb) quit
The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y
[<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">root at localhost</A> bin]# 
-----------

So now the server doesent crash when i try to register a user, it just,
halts or what you call it. I can make other connections, but it doesent
give me an id, neither does it care what i send to it, it just ignores
it. 

Ive made sure that my folders had the rights it should be, by giving all
permissions:
chmod 777 -R /jabber
and
chmod 777 -R /usr/local/jabber

Its the same.

I think i might have been drunk or something when i came up with that
subject, im using jabberd 1.4.4 :)

Well i feel like im doin progress here, thanks to you!

Hope you can help with that tiny bit of debug info..

Regards
/Lars
