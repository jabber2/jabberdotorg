<PRE>Hey All,

Peter Fisk (Cc'd) has developed direct support for XMPP into Vista
Smalltalk, a .NET and now Flash-based implementation of Smalltalk and Lisp.
It seems he's run into some problems, however, with getting XMPP to work in
the Flash-based version (see:
<A HREF="http://vistascript.net/vistascript/flex/vst.swf">http://vistascript.net/vistascript/flex/vst.swf</A> for a working demo and visit
<A HREF="http://vistasmalltalk.wordpress.com/">http://vistasmalltalk.wordpress.com/</A> for a running list of entries that
provide various demo's to help get you started)

In follow-up to a question I posed to Peter in a recent blog entry,

@
<A HREF="http://vistasmalltalk.wordpress.com/2007/02/22/wpfe-10-wont-support-clr/#comment-3676">http://vistasmalltalk.wordpress.com/2007/02/22/wpfe-10-wont-support-clr/#comment-3676</A>

David,
&gt;<i> On opening a socket connection to any Jabber server, I can catch the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;connection established&quot; event after which it seems to hang. There is no
</I>&gt;<i> problem connecting from Flash to http servers and I can connect to Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> using Exodus with no problem. I added a &quot;crossdomain.xml&quot; file to the same
</I>&gt;<i> directory as the *.swf file:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts?
</I>

I personally don't have enough experience with Flash to be able to know the
answer (or at least the possible answer) to the problem.  Am digging around
a bit to see what I might be able to come up with (I doubt much I need to
express to this list how cool it would be to have this capability built into
a Smalltalk/Lisp interpreter for Flash! ;-)), but it seemed worth posting
this to the dev-list to see if anyone else out there might be able to lead
and guide me, and ultimately, Peter, to the solution.

Thanks in advance for any and all help/advice!
