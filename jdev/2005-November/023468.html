Unfortunately, that simple fix doesn't solve the problem. 1) The server 
I am working with is using ejabberd and as such uses the ejabberd muc 
component. 2) Fixing any single copy of muc isn't much help when all the 
other copies are still wrong, especially when as big and well known a 
server as jabber.org is using a broken version.

The real problem here is that the spec and the &quot;reference&quot; 
implementation disagree and I know that at least gaim had been tested 
against muc on jabber.org and as such was broken regarding the spec 
(which I noticed when it failed to work on our server at work). gaim 
in cvs currently obeys the spec but that causes a problem in the 
other diretion. The new problem being that client authors either need 
to pick one set of servers to be broken against (ones using 
mu-conference or ones obeying the spec), or they need to look in 
both places despite the spec existing and indicating the correct place.

Also there were a couple small other comments about the JEP in my email, 
but I'll send it again since I figure most people (liek you) don't have 
the old email anymore.
