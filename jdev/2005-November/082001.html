I admit I kind of trusted the website for having a decent as well as  
recent screenshot on as much as it entry pages...

The screenshot you posted looks a _lot_ better and should I have seen  
that instead of the one on the coccinella website, I probably  
wouldn't have bothered ranting about it... :-)

But now that we're at it:
- native widgets for any UI toolkit (be it tcl/tk or swing or...) are  
only as good as the native widgets themselves. Don't get me wrong:  
both GTK and Qt, being themeable, have some pretty decent themes. I  
kind of like the default ubuntu gtk theme, for example, but take a  
look at Keramik and tell me that style isn't too intruding... I am  
very glad it only lasted one minor release as default KDE theme.
- about coccinella (and more specifically the screenshot you  
posted ;)): just noting that I don't get why the font in your  
groupchat is at least 2 points smaller than the font in the users  
list for that groupchat ?
- And why do these icons have to be that large ?
- Also, looking at the left-most edge of the chatroom window... Why  
does that has to be in two levels of depth? A lot of current Linux UI  
themes suffer a lot of what I would call 'ballast'. In my very humble  
opinion, this interferes too much with the user experience...

Anyway, I realize this all has little or nothing to do with jabber  
development, but sometimes it's hard to draw the lines between client  
issues and user interface issues... :)

Cheers,

Pieter.
