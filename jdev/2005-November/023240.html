<PRE>Hello, Matthias!

On Fri, 04 Nov 2005 21:33:20 +0100, you said:

 MW&gt; Hi!  I have implemented SASL EXTERNAL on s2s connects in jabberd14 the
 MW&gt; last days, and like to share some thoughts on this, as well as I'd like to
 MW&gt; get thoughts of other developpers, that already implemented this.

 MW&gt; - When do you offer SASL EXTERNAL on an incoming connection? I
 MW&gt; implemented, that the s2s connection manager always checks the peers
 MW&gt; certificate as soon as a TLS layer is established. Only if the certificate
 MW&gt; could be validated (not expired, if the incoming stream had a from
 MW&gt; attribute if this matches the certificate, signed by a trusted CA, ...) I
 MW&gt; offer the peer to use SASL EXTERNAL. In all other cases I know that SASL
 MW&gt; EXTERNAL would fail anyway so I do not have to offer it. Better for the
 MW&gt; peer to try dialback.

In latest SVN version of ejabberd, certificate on incoming S2S connection is
checked right after receiving &quot;&lt;stream:stream&gt;&quot;, but without using &quot;from&quot;
attribute.

 MW&gt; - What do you do if you connected to an other server which offered you
 MW&gt; SASL auth but the authentication failed? Do you retry the connection using
 MW&gt; dialback or do you consider it as a final auth failure? Currently I do not
 MW&gt; retry it using dialback but bounce the stanza back to the sender. I am
 MW&gt; aware that this might be wrong and retrying the connection using dialback
 MW&gt; could be better.

ejabberd retries connection using starttls+dialback.

 MW&gt; - I guess at least for now we have to handle certificates, that do not
 MW&gt; contain the id-on-xmppAddr object as well and therefore have to support
 MW&gt; domains as commonName as well. Right? In that case, it is known practice
 MW&gt; in such certificates to have wildcards in domains,
 MW&gt; e.g. &quot;*.example.com&quot;. Do you handle these? How do you handle these? I am
 MW&gt; allowing this certificate for &quot;subdomain.example.com&quot;, but not for
 MW&gt; &quot;example.com&quot;.

I don't handle this case yet.

 MW&gt; - If the certificate is for &quot;example.com&quot;, do you accept this certificate
 MW&gt; to be used for &quot;service.example.com&quot; as well? Currently I don't. But I am
 MW&gt; not sure if this is correct/intended by RFC3920.

Same here.

 MW&gt; - Do you support having a SASL authenticated link in one direction and a
 MW&gt; dialback &quot;authenticated&quot; link in the other direction between two servers? 

Yes.

 MW&gt; Especially do you accept and process to receive db:verify requests on a
 MW&gt; SASL link? Currently I do.

Yes, ejabberd accepts it, but doesn't try to send db:verify in SASL links.

 MW&gt; - Do you package a set of CA certificates with your server distribution? 
 MW&gt; Which CAs should be trusted/included?

No.

 MW&gt; What servers out there support SASL EXTERNAL already and are available for
 MW&gt; at least evaluation? I'd like to do some interoperability tests?

e.jabber.ru, but it doesn't process id-on-xmppAddr.
