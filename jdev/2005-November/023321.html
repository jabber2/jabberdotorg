Agreed.

Just to be fully clear, this JEP emerged originally in the brain of Dave 
Smith (who was then working for Jabber Inc.), and after some 
conversations between the two of us I wrote up versions 0.1 and 0.2 of 
the JEP. Ian came in at version 0.3 and has much improved the JEP since 
then, but if he had decided to patent a similar technique rather than 
contribute to the JEP, he would have patented his own technique and the 
JEP would have proceeded independently. Thankfully he decided to go the 
open route because the results are pretty powerful. :-)
