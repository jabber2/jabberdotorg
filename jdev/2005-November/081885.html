It must only implement TLS. Offering it is not required (sometimes it
may be forbidden by local regulations, or something).

</I>
I don't think that is a good idea. If a client  requests TLS it expects
some answer. If the server doesn't answer, then client would wait and
finally timeout. IMHO it is better to close the stream as soon as the
error is detected. There is no need to keep a connection to a _broken_
client.

And, I guess, XMPP 0.9 server would return a stream error, as
&lt;starttls xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-tls'/&gt; is not a valid
stazna.
