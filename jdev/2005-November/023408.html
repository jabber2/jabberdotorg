<PRE>&gt;<i> Also, &quot;Java&quot; didn't &quot;drop&quot; Swing.   IBM developed the SWT library which is
</I>&gt;<i> used by the Eclipse IDE and RCP framework.  Sun is still very much behind
</I>&gt;<i> Swing.  Swing's new GTK LookAndFeel is using native Gtk widgets and is
</I>&gt;<i> looking VERY nice.
</I>
Actually to be precise, it's not using native widgets.  What it's doing is
manually drawing the same thing, much like it does on Windows.  I have
configured Gtk to use that FreeDesktop theme which makes it use the Qt
theme to draw the Gtk theme, and it doesn't work at all.

It does, however, work with BlueCurve and some other themes, and looks
perfect when those are in use.

On Windows, though, Swing draws just like any real theme, and thus looks
better than SWT, which does not.
