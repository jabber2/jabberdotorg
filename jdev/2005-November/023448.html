&gt;<i> I was reading JEP-33 and some questions came up to my mind. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) In the examples (section 9), messages being sent to BCC users are not
</I>&gt;<i> including the &lt;address type='bcc'/&gt; element. Section 5 says: &quot;Each 'bcc'
</I>&gt;<i> recipient MUST receive only the &lt;address type='bcc'/&gt; associated with that
</I>&gt;<i> addressee&quot; so I think that we need to update the examples. Should the
</I>&gt;<i> address element include the jid attribute when sending a message to the BCC
</I>&gt;<i> user?
</I>Examples in section 6.   That's meant to be read:  MUST not receive
bcc's for other people (as in standard email methodology).  It's not
meant to exclude sending of to and cc addresses

&gt;<i> 2) Section 3 specifies that IQ packets may also include an &lt;addresses&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> element but not as a direct child. An example showing how an &lt;addresses&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> element should be used would be very helpful. I guess that servers should
</I>&gt;<i> check if an &lt;addresses&gt; element is being included inside the direct child.
</I>&gt;<i> Is that correct?
</I>
Section 4 has good examples of what Section 3 means.  The whole point
of the addressing, is that servers don't need to have any extra
support for multicasting.

&gt;<i> 3) The &lt;address&gt; element may include a &quot;node&quot; attribute. How would the node
</I>&gt;<i> attribute be used by the server and a client? An example may help me
</I>&gt;<i> visualize a use case when a node is needed. Should the server just treat it
</I>&gt;<i> as another attribute and send it to the client or remote server? Is it up to
</I>&gt;<i> the client to use that information?
</I>Are you considering that the 'server' is a standard jabber server,
with no extra multicast support.  There's an extra multicast component
that is handling all the multicast requests.

&gt;<i> 4) In section 2.2 (Discovering Server Support), does that mean that the
</I>&gt;<i> disco#items may only be sent once? IOW, only the first disco items below the
</I>&gt;<i> IM server level may provide the multicast service. Is this correct?
</I>this exchange is pretty nasty, and could slow down messages if it's
done each time.  I think the JEP should explicitly state the process
of Service Discovery and should specifiy that components SHOULD cache
this detection.  I'd like to see this re-worked, but I'm not sure of a
better way to do it.

&gt;<i> 5) It would be nice if the JEP may include examples or more information
</I>&gt;<i> about the address types: ofrom and oto, so it would be easier to understand
</I>&gt;<i> when a client or server would use those address types.
</I>
JEP-0146 has yet to be updated to use JEP-0033, but I've chatted to
Remko about it, and he does plan to adopt the use of JEP-0033.   I
have also implemented JEP-0033 style forwarding in the Psi adhoc/rc
branch.
