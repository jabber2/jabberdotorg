Realistically this does not seem very likely, since a server that does 
not support TLS is probably an XMPP 0.9 (old-style Jabber) server and a 
server that supports XMPP 1.0 MUST offer TLS. However, I suppose it is 
possible for an XMPP 1.0 server to support TLS in the implementation but 
have that support be disabled in the deployment (even though I think 
that violates the spec). In that case, it seems to me that there are two 
options:

1. silently ignore the TLS request
2. return a TLS &lt;failure/&gt; and close the stream (though why should you 
do that if you don't even support TLS, eh?)
3. return a &lt;not-authorized/&gt; stream error

I think #1 is most appropriate, since that is what (I think) an XMPP 0.9 
server would do.

&gt;<i> 2) server required TLS and client ignored it (i.e. never secured the 
</I>&gt;<i> connection and went ahead with SASL or iq:auth)
</I>
I think this is &lt;not-authorized/&gt;. The initiating entity is attempting 
to proceed with communications before completing the necessary 
authentication precondition.
