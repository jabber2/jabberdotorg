Lightspeed is not enough for an interplanetary instant-messaging system. A long
time ago I was talking with my physics bachelor friend and he suggested the use
of small particles spin, i.e. when you force an electron to chance it's spin the
other electron with opposite spin instantly changes, and he said that it works
even when you put then quite far away, and it's not lightspeed limited. Maybe in
 one hundred years this will be possible  :)
