<PRE>Hi,

Was just looking at the Directed presence section of the RFC and
noticed something that I thought should be mentioned in the revision.
(Do give me a bonk on the head if this has already been discussed
before).

When a user sends unavailable directed presence to a contact, the
contact's resources see him as unavailable.  Suppose the contact logs
in from another resource and a presence probe is received by the
user's server, what presence state should be returned?  Common sense
would say that unavailable presence should be sent.  But there doesnt
seem to be any mention of this in the RFC - implementations would
assume that &quot;current&quot; presence needs to be sent.

Regards,
Vinod.

PS: Any thoughts on the multiple iq items error handling anyone?
