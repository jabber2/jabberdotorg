Actually there was a reply to these question raised, and some of those  
were answered before the council's decision (I guess you can't expect the  
council to read every message on this list). However, those replies were  
left unanswered as well (before and after the rejection).

However trying to get this JEP accepted inspired another JEP, there were  
some issues raised about that JEP (it doesn't replace the proposed  
functionality of roster-subsync, and some security nitpicking compared to  
roster-subsync). These issues were not addressed, however the JEP is an  
improvement over another JEP it superseeded. And today this JEP (&quot;Roster  
Item Exchange&quot;: <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0144.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0144.html</A>) is not only  
accepted but a DRAFT as well.

So if you're looking to use something yourself, I'd look at that first.  
Only if you need the specific features that roster-subsync offers over 144  
(synchronized subscription states, security where contacts can only modify  
their own state, not others') should you look at that.

Unless you want to take advantage of this feature offered by pyMSN of  
course, then besides here:
