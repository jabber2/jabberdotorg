<PRE>Alright, thanks, that was helpful. One last question: 'polling' only 
limits the time between sending two polling ('empty') requests, right? 
Other requests can be send more frequently?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The 'polling' attribute specifies the minimal amount of time a client

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time between the starttime of both requests, or the time between 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receiving a reply of the first request and the start of the second request?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Between start times makes the most sense.  When you poll, the server

</I>&gt;<i> a response, some messages will experience high latency if they arrive in
</I>&gt;<i> the dead time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A good client and server implementation should provide you with about
</I>&gt;<i> the same latency as a directly connected TCP client (minus the proxy
</I>&gt;<i> latency of course).  It's a cleverly designed protocol.
