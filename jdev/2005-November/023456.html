<PRE>
Just discovered something interesting with jabber1.4.3 and muc 0.6.0.

I've been having a problem with my jabber install where it's only
allowing messages at a rate of about 1 every 2 seconds and dropping
messages in between. I thought the problem was karma or maybe something
in the config. What I finally figured out is that jabber just doesn't
like &lt;message&gt; messages that don't have a non-empty &lt;body&gt; element. 

What I had been sending were game-event messages that looked like this:

&lt;message&gt;
	&lt;x xmlns=&quot;mtvn/games&quot;&gt;
	// game event payload here
  	&lt;/x&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
		
...no matter what I tried, these message would start to propogate very
slowly after I had sent the first few.

I finally tried a test where I sent regular messages with a &lt;body&gt; and
those propogated normally. I experimented a bit and now I'm doing this:

&lt;message&gt;	
	// this dummy body element seems to make jabber happy
	// it doesn't work if you just send &lt;body/&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;1&lt;/body&gt; 
	&lt;x xmlns=&quot;mtvn/games&quot;&gt;
	// game event payload here
  	&lt;/x&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;

...and propogation speed is back to normal.

I didn't look into jabber's internals at all to figure out why this
might be so. Just thought I'd put it out there in case anyone comes
across a similar problem.
