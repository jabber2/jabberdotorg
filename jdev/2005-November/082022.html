<PRE>I was reading JEP-33 and some questions came up to my mind. :)

1) In the examples (section 9), messages being sent to BCC users are not 
including the &lt;address type='bcc'/&gt; element. Section 5 says: &quot;Each 'bcc' 
recipient MUST receive only the &lt;address type='bcc'/&gt; associated with that 
addressee&quot; so I think that we need to update the examples. Should the 
address element include the jid attribute when sending a message to the BCC 
user?

2) Section 3 specifies that IQ packets may also include an &lt;addresses&gt; 
element but not as a direct child. An example showing how an &lt;addresses&gt; 
element should be used would be very helpful. I guess that servers should 
check if an &lt;addresses&gt; element is being included inside the direct child. 
Is that correct?

3) The &lt;address&gt; element may include a &quot;node&quot; attribute. How would the node 
attribute be used by the server and a client? An example may help me 
visualize a use case when a node is needed. Should the server just treat it 
as another attribute and send it to the client or remote server? Is it up to 
the client to use that information?

4) In section 2.2 (Discovering Server Support), does that mean that the 
disco#items may only be sent once? IOW, only the first disco items below the 
IM server level may provide the multicast service. Is this correct?

5) It would be nice if the JEP may include examples or more information 
about the address types: ofrom and oto, so it would be easier to understand 
when a client or server would use those address types.

Thanks,
