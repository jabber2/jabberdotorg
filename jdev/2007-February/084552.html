Well, as someone with much experience with mixing different languages  
in a single project (for example, my project in SoC 2006 was of that  
sort), I can assure you that it' not really worth it. I agree that C+ 
+ is ugly as sin and makes everything much more complicated than it  
has to be, but writing a bridge between two languages is just about  
as ugly (except when you can have no-custom-code bridges like between  
Ruby and Objective C, but that's not possible with C++).
Note that this does not apply for scripting languages for game logic  
(like lua), but they aren't used for the game code itself, just the  
content.

I'm still waiting for a native Ruby compiler, game programming would  
be like heaven then :)

According to thedailywtf.com, game code doesn't need to be  
maintainable, since you write it once, ship your game, then throw it  
away and work on your next game :)
