Yes, of course. I'd say that you just private messages [1] for that. I
don't think it matters too much that the messages don't originate from
the room itself, and for clients that don't have a specialized game UI,
I think it is very intuitive to interact with a game master.

&gt;<i> Also as pointed out by Michal the protocol needs to be able to support

</I>&gt;<i> MUC and would work without it, without the protocol being much if any 
</I>&gt;<i> different.
</I>
I haven't fully read the thread, but I'm not sure why that would be
true.
