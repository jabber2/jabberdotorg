I think the answer to your question is &quot;yes, everything happens on the 
server&quot;. Except that's confusing, because I'm not talking about a *Jabber* 
server. Every game requires a Volity game server, which is a Jabber client 
(bot).

If that's what you meant too, then good. :)

As everyone has said, cheating is a problem -- both passive cheating 
(seeing private information) and active (making illegal moves). Having a 
game server makes the problems go away. And it's much easier to build a 
uniform system than to say &quot;ok, these games don't need a server, those 
games need one, and these others don't *need* one but it'll save us a lot 
of anticheating design...&quot; The fact that tic-tac-toe can be done more 
simply isn't a compelling argument; tic-tac-toe doesn't draw in many real 
players.

Also, the game server winds up handling a lot of infrastructure work 
(noticing new players, distributing game status to them, tracking players 
across client disconnects).

When Bush says &quot;Stay the course,&quot; what he means is &quot;I don't know what to
do next.&quot; He's been saying this for years now.
