Well, I guess there will be clients holding these servers at the end and
when they disconnect&#8230;

I just think there is a space for protocol that makes it possible
without server.

But it adds a good experience to communication, just as a small game
when there is time (well, I play by messages, sending it in ascii art,
but many people get confused :D)

Please stay calm. There is no use both of us being hysterical.
