<PRE>Hi,
I think this thread has become little bit OT :-( Thanks to all for
suggestions. Thanks Alex for the link. I asked of VC++ stack because of two
reasons. 1. I wanted to add XMPP support to my already existing application
which is written in VC++. 2. I wanted to know whether there is any stack
that is made for windows. In my experience I found that normally stacks will
be written for linux and finally someone willl port it to windows. Because
of this there will be dependency with many other softwares in linux like,
OpenXML, OpenSSL etc. I will need to compile these libraries also in windows
and distribute them. Which makes the binary size a little more big than it
should be. Can someone suggest a stack which has less dependency with other
libraries and is available in windows? (Any language is ok. I think, my
application will be able to link to stack dynamicaly).
Thanks,
Regards,
Rajeev K
