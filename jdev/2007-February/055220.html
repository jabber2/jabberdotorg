When we had this discussion in the past in the JIG, this was exactly
what I was alluding to.
When I wrote a chess server for a friend (not xmpp based though), the
problems we faced included rule enforcements (we wanted to support a
bunch of chess variants including 2+ player ones), enforcing rules &amp; how
to prevent rule violation, how to manage user info (elo rating, stats,
etc), 'seeking'/processing invites for game requests, how to allow
observe &amp; chat with other observers(whisper)/also to players(kibitz),
tournaments, etc.
In the context of xmpp, a lot of this is already present in the defined
rfc/xep's itself (read only pubsub nodes for stats, muc's for
multicasting info : seeks, kibitz/whisper, etc) and if I was to do it
today, I might seriously look at xmpp.

All this for chess - different games have differing set of requirements
and any infrastructure xep should be flexible enough to allow any game
(or the targeted class of game types) to be supported.
A first person shooter multiplayer game like Counterstrike source will
have differing requirements from multiplayer scrabble or chess or bomberman.

Mridul
