&gt;<i> I think if a server does not care that there is a security layer to

</I>&gt;<i> SASL security layer inside the TLS layer. But this shouldn't be the 
</I>&gt;<i> client that decides that this SASL layer is not established, but 
</I>&gt;<i> the server.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore I think that Psi should establish the auth-conf layer of 
</I>&gt;<i> DIGEST-MD5 if that is offered by the server - but servers typically 
</I>&gt;<i> should not offer this layer if TLS has already been established - 
</I>&gt;<i> as it is the server for which it matters if that second security

</I>
Or, as a short-term possibility, you could run auth-int inside TLS, 
and then exchange XMPP-level channel binding messages, perhaps via a 
simple IQ. That'll have much the same effect as channel binding. (Of 
course, without the auth-int, it's meaningless).

That's got to be a lot cheaper than encrypting twice, and should work 
find in the normal case of there being no MITM. It's also much easier 
to code.
