<PRE>Thanks Richard for this valuable information.
 
What I am trying to do is to extend your &quot;game matching service&quot; in a
&quot;game matching and creating service&quot; : a client may request to create new game
hosts. So I would like the &quot;game matching and creating service&quot; to instantiate 
game hosts with their JIDs and specific parameters, and I don't know
how to do that : I thought an internal component was loaded at server start
according to its configuration file, so I guess my dynamic game hosts can not
be internal components... ?

If this is right, the alternative may be that the
&quot;game matching and creating service&quot; launches an external script (e. g. a php
script on another web server) that creates a new daemon bot and register it
as the game host. What's weird in that case is that this communication (launching
the php script) is outside the Jabber protocol.
 
Norman, you suggest another seductive solution, but it looks to me that it
implies a modification of the server source code, and the way it implements MUCs.

I hope my questions are useful to other people than me,
since I am asking a lot :p !

Guillaume

I think one of the things that is being forgotten here, is that you
could design the game master component to _be_ the MUC room.  There's
nothing in any spec to say that all participants see the same room
state.  You should be able to very easily send different content to
each member of the room.

The game component (acting like a MUC room) can do all the validation
checks based on it's own internal state, and doesn't have to expose
the full game state to anyone.

Remebering that MUC is really just a set of protocols indiciating the
preferred way of simulating joining a room/game, and sending messages.
In a non-game context it makes sense that all users see the same
data, in a game context, not so much.
