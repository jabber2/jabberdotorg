Hi -- I'm one of the Volity developers. I missed this discussion 
yesterday, but I can comment on how Volity got the way it is.

The early Volity discussions went very much like this one: we need a &quot;game 
layer&quot;, which can handle players invitations, game membership, chat, 
outcome recording.

And one big bullet point was: use the Jabber standards. Ironically. :-) 
The point of using XML-RPC was not to bypass the &quot;standard XMPP way&quot; of 
doing things, but to *be* a standard XMPP way of doing things. (Similarly, 
a lot of the game discovery uses standard service discovery, with a 
soupcon of XEP-0115.)

The idea was to make the &quot;game layer&quot; sit cleanly on top of Jabber. That 
way we could concentrate on making it do what we needed, without requiring 
Jabber to change each time we came up with a new idea. Proposing Volity as 
a JEP[*] would have been like building a play-by-email game by requesting 
an extension to RFC822.

Similarly, we thought it would be better for all games to use a &quot;bot&quot; 
referee, rather than putting game code in the server. Better separation. 
(And this proved true, because we changed the server software on 
volity.net a couple of times, with only the smallest hitches to the game 
system.)

[* This was before XEP.]

If the Bush administration hasn't shipped you to Syria for interrogation,
it's for one reason: they don't feel like it. Not because you're patriotic.
