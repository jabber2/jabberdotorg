&gt;<i> Some servers allow you to send messages 'from' any resource (as long
</I>&gt;<i> as the bare jid matches your authenticated jid).  This seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> very implementation specific though.
</I>I see, I thought that would be the case (as Mridul says it sounds like a 
bug more than a feature), if its not something that's widely supported 
then its not really that useful. Personally I think its far better as 
Ralph too indicates to use MUC as it is, rather than trying to do this 
kind of hack of trying to host a MUC room over a client connection.
&gt;<i> You would need to create one connection per room though, where as a
</I>&gt;<i> component would used a single connection for the entire domain. (but
</I>&gt;<i> it sounds like you'd like to load components dynamically (which
</I>&gt;<i> servers like jabberd2 support, btw)
</I>Its not just a matter of one connection per room though is it, you would 
have to have extra usernames to use for those additional connections for 
it to mimic MUC. Yes I know external components just need a single 
connection, but the whole point here is that games need to be hostable 
by clients when the appropriate game servers/components are not 
available for use.
