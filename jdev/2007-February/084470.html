Right.

&gt;<i> Now, if you use SASL security layers in addition to TLS, then this does

</I>
On the server side I also cannot just not offer TLS and only offer a 
security layer in SASL. If I would do so, I would not allow the client 
to authenticate using TLS - which is the probably strongest way we 
currently have for client authentication and ensuring an encrypting layer.

I think if a server does not care that there is a security layer to the 
client (current standard case), the connection should not use a SASL 
security layer inside the TLS layer. But this shouldn't be the client 
that decides that this SASL layer is not established, but the server.
Therefore I think that Psi should establish the auth-conf layer of 
DIGEST-MD5 if that is offered by the server - but servers typically 
should not offer this layer if TLS has already been established - as it 
is the server for which it matters if that second security layer exists 
or not.
