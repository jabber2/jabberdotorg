Well, it was not as much denied as first argued about the proper way to
do it (new requirements kept popping up) and it got ignored at the end,
and I did not have much time working on it lately, so I wanted to try
again and make people cooperate somehow.

And, about rewriting, it may be reused, if it is found useful by anyone.
I just wanted to know what people want it to do.

(And, jabber:x:gamesession wouldn't be probably the NS, but thats a
detail)

With regards

With windows, you pay for the software, but you get all the T-shirts for free.
