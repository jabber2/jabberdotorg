<PRE>Really, this is a client implementation issue.  You see the MUC room as too
formal, when in fact, they're completely throw-away, and the client could
handle it behind the scenes.  Generate a random chat room, invite everyone
in, have your conversation, and leave easily, without the formal interface
of a full-on MUC room.  This is one of the disadvantages of XMPP not being
tightly integegrated with a service (anyone can run XMPP in whatever way
they want), so it seems to me that there needs to be a proceedural XEP and
maybe some service discovery for default place on the server to make
throw-away MUC rooms so that the client doesn't have to be configured for a
particular MUC component and doesn't have to assume either.

In short, yes, MUC is the way to do it, and that's what it's there to
partially serve.  There just needs to be a way for clients to distinguish
formal rooms with informal ones, and I think your feature request would be
handled.
