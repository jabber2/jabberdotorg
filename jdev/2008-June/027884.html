<PRE>Hola.   I'm a newcomer at this list, but friends with Anders and  
Blaine.  I'll also be at the summit this year.   I'm working on a,  
still under wraps, project for Geni.com that involves heavy xmpp  
development.  Currently I'm working on a xmpp4r component to serve as  
the gateway between our application and 'the world'.   I would say my  
component is acting like a glorified, load balance-able bot, but it's  
a bit more than that.    There's not a lot of information out there on  
components in general and even less on writing components with  
xmpp4r.  We've made tremendous progress, however , thanks to help from  
Anders and Blaine, as well as lots of trial and error.   We're well on  
our way towards building a general xmpp4r component framework that is  
analogous to xmpp4r-simple, but for component development.

The good news is that we will be open sourcing this component  
framework so that others can benefit.    This will probably be the  
first of a number of pieces in development that we will be open  
sourcing.   We realize that the xmpp community is still in its infancy  
and as such, everyone, including ourselves, benefits when we all  
share. That said, I'm curious if anyone else out there has had much  
experience building these types of components, especially with xmpp4r,  
and would like to exchange notes.   I am also hoping to share some of  
my design decisions to solicit some feedback.

So, anyone want to exchange war stories?

Thanks,
adam
