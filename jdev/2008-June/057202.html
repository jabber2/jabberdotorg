Except that pretty much all of that is a matter of client implementation.

The spec for MUC specifically envisioned potentially using it as a
seamless transition from a one-on-one discussion to a multi-way discussion.

The scenario is that a one-on-one discussion is taking place and the
users decide that they want to add a third person.  So one of the people
invites a third person into the chat.

The client, and this can be completely behind the scenes, needs to go
create a MUC, potentially send history to it, then send invites to the
other two users with a &lt;continue/&gt; element.

This is all described in section 7.6 of
<A HREF="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html</A>

This protocol capability gives clients all the tools they need to
seamlessly convert a one-on-one to a quick ad-hoc sort of MUC chat with
multiple people.  The user need not be even aware that MUC is being used
to do it.
