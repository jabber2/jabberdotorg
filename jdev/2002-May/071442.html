It seems to me that you are trying to solve this issue in the wrong way.
If you want guaranteed message delivery, then the protocol will have to be
adjusted to have clients send notification when a message is delivered
(like return-receipts in email, but hopefully more intelligent). In fact,
I would argue that guaranteed message delivery should be the
responsibility of the client rather than the server. Modifiying the server
to provide this functionality brings up the question of &quot;what is the
appropriate behavior if a message isn't deliver?&quot; Should the server put
the message in offline storage? Bounce an error message? What happens if
offline storage isn't configured on the receiving party's server?

On the other hand, I do agree that faulty presence is an issue. I hate
messaging people and then realize that they aren't actually online. My
only goal is that we keep this discussion focused. You will *NOT* solve
lost message issues with a ping/pong solution, however, you might be able
to provide better presence reliability.

That being said, I'm afraid that I'd have to side with Dave Waite on this
issue, I don't think ping/pong is a good solution (or even your existing
ping solution), especially when you consider that wireless clients are
likely to have some of the most pronounced connectivity issues and highest
costs of bandwidth. A better solution should be proposed as a protocol
change, perhaps as a negotiated timeout period where a client tells the
server upon logging in that if it doesn't send data within a given amount
of time, then the server should consider it unavailable.

My $0.02.
