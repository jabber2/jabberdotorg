<PRE>I would recommend a heartbeat which instead does what clients have done 
for a while - sends a whitespace character in-between XML packets. You 
would need to modify the client connection piece to do this 
(c2s/jadc2s/jpoll/dpsm/whatever); but it would be significantly less 
intrusive to a client than a separate component sending new XML 
elements. Rather than having the clients reply to this message, their 
TCP/IP stack will just ACK the new packet. Failure will result in the 
stack of the server recognising the socket as dead, which will be 
treated just like a (clean) disconnect is now.

</I>&gt;<i> error.  Unfortunately this is unreliable as is.  I've had users that I 
</I>&gt;<i> know are offline stay listed as online for as long as 12 hours!  To 
</I>&gt;<i> make matters much worse, when you send a message to a person in this

</I>&gt;<i> server will soon afterwards log the faulty connection off and the 
</I>&gt;<i> person will dissapear from your roster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I think the only possible way to deal with this is to have 
</I>&gt;<i> a heartbeat between the client/server (I'd be willing to bet that all 
</I>&gt;<i> the major IM systems do this, because they don't exhibit this 
</I>&gt;<i> problem). Temas expressed some concern over scalability, but to me 
</I>&gt;<i> this problem is worth fixing at a small cost to scalability.  (In 
</I>&gt;<i> fact, it may help some because you will not have non-existent users 
</I>&gt;<i> taking up resources!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I'm willing to spend a small amount of time at least prototyping 
</I>&gt;<i> a solution for testing, although given all my other projects I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> have a lot of time.  So far, however, I've had a terribly frustrating 
</I>&gt;<i> time trying to gather enough documentation or sample code to even 
</I>&gt;<i> start. What I've been trying to do is build a server component w/ 
</I>&gt;<i> jabberbeans (I'm fond of Java, but I could go with other solutions if 
</I>&gt;<i> they are better...) that would send out a packet to all online users 
</I>&gt;<i> once per configurable time period, and then kick off anyone it doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> hear a reply from before the next heartbeat.  Ideally it could listen 
</I>&gt;<i> for messages and presence info from clients and skip a heartbeat if 
</I>&gt;<i> other messages have been received from the client during that 
</I>&gt;<i> heartbeat period, although I'm not clear if a component can listen 
</I>&gt;<i> globally like that or not. 
</I>&gt;<i> What I've got so far is a server component which runs and lists itself 
</I>&gt;<i> in the client's browser, but I'm pretty stuck past there because I've 
</I>&gt;<i> failed to find documentation on server components past that point (or 
</I>&gt;<i> even example server components).  In specific:
</I>&gt;<i> 1a) Can I register with the server and have it send me presence 
</I>&gt;<i> information globally for everyone without having to have users 
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly register with me?
</I>&gt;<i>  - OR -
</I>&gt;<i> 1b) If not I figure I can just query for all online users right when 
</I>&gt;<i> it comes time to send out the heartbeat, which I found how to do last 
</I>&gt;<i> night with an iq:browse to servername/admin.  However, jabberbeans 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have a ExtensionBuilder for that namespace.  Is there a way w/ 
</I>&gt;<i> jabberbeans to send custom xml or do I have to write my own 
</I>&gt;<i> ExtensionBuilder?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Can I globally listen to &lt;message&gt; packets coming from users 
</I>&gt;<i> without disturbing the normal delivery process?
</I>&gt;<i> 3) I can always send a client version or time IQ to the client as a 
</I>&gt;<i> dummy packet for my heartbeat, but ideally I want the smallest message 
</I>&gt;<i> possible to which clients will respond to without any user 
</I>&gt;<i> intervention or knowledge.  (Sounds like a prime place for a JEP if 
</I>&gt;<i> this works out). Does anyone have ideas on a particular message type 
</I>&gt;<i> to send?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have more questions, but I haven't researched them yet, so I'll wait. 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
