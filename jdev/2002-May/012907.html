<PRE>Unfortunately, removing users from a jabber server is harder than it 
looks. You have to take into account the xdb cache and in memory caching 
in jsm.

Currently there is no real good way to remove a user. Removing the 
user.xml doesn't guarantee it will inaccessable largely because it is 
cached in so many places. To remove a user it requires a kill -15 to the 
main jabberd (shutdown the server) not a nice option.

Technically accoring to protocol sending an iq:register with a &lt;remove&gt; 
tag should remove you (works for transports but not jsm, go figure) but 
it doesn't. So the next best thing is to just change their password to 
god awful long MD5 hex string so they cannot access it. But this is 
still bad because that username is still cached in jsm therefore it will 
still get offline messages indefinitely (if there is mod_offline).

No real clean way to remove users at this point...we are going to need 
to wait for 1.5 where the server can take a SIGHUP to flush dead users.

(if you can't tell I have studied this abit :)

As for modifying rosters left and right, thats going to be a little more 
difficult. After gathering the dead user's roster, it should be 
acceptable to send:

	&lt;presence type='unsubscribe' from='<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">deaduser at server.com</A>' 			 
to='<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">roster_item at otherserver.com</A>'&gt;

for each roster item as a component or something on the jabberd backbone 
where you dont have the restrictions of jsm, and clean up that way.

The bad part about that is the amount of packets to do this, where as if 
the Header JEP (does it do other packet types or just messages? it 
should do presence too...) did presence packets you could send one large 
packet with an unsub to all the roster items at once.

&lt;plug&gt;
But if anyone is really interested in helping me with JabminRPC stuff
perl or C++ then by all means send me an email off list or jabber me. 
There is a bunch of code just sitting there not doing anything except 
getting bitrot, and i could use some motiviation/fresh faces :)
&lt;/plug&gt;

Anyhow, this email is over.
