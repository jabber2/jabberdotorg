<PRE>Can someone tell me how to differentiate between sending someone a URL 'link' to someone and sending an actual file?  Is there a difference?  

For example, if I send someone a link to '<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/index.html'">http://www.jabber.org/index.html'</A> I would want the default action to be to open that URL in a web browser, but it is conceivable that I may want to actually send someone a .html file (or a bunch of them) and have them saved to disk rather than being displayed.  Say I wanted to transfer a website to someone using the file transfer feature on my Jabber client, and I drag and drop 100 .html files....I don't want 100 browsers to open at the other end.  Is this left up to the receiving client to work out how to treat them?

Or say I want to send someone a perl file, so I send them filename.pl.  That should be saved to disk right?  But what if I send a URL that happens to be a CGI script that ends in .pl?  (Say <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/search.pl?query=oob">http://www.jabber.org/search.pl?query=oob</A>)  That should be displayed in the browser - but I can't see any way in the spec to differentiate between the two.

Also, can someone tell me what port (range) file transfers and other oob transfers should be assigned to?  Is there any guidence on this?

Thanks,

Michael.
