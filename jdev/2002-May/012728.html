<PRE>hello,

I am using Linux RedHat 7.1 version , and want to
setup jabber-1.4.2 with pth-1.4.0 version.

i am running jabber-1.4.1 server with mysql database.
i want to upgrade to jabber-1.4.2, for which i have
downloaded the latest server files. Then i copied my
old .xml files and all my transport files. i have not
changed any configurations in xml files after updating
from old jabber-1.4.1 server. Now when i run my
server, i am facing some problems:

My transports(yahoo, msn etc) are not functioning
properly.

Any request takes long time in processing , it gets
inside a while loop in
/home/jabber/jabber-1.4.2/jabberd/jabberd.c file ,
where there is a sleep time of 60 seconds given. i
have tried reducing the sleep time , but there is not
much improvement. the login, registration , requests
are taking 20-25 minutes to come out of the loop.

Also when no request comes from client, then also the
load check loop goes on executing , as we can see from
the log file.

can anyone help me to fix up the problem with
jabber-1.4.2.


Also, is there any way , one can logon independently
logon to the transports, one by one as per his need,
right now whenever someone logs on to jabber, he is
logon to all his registered transports simultaneously.


And, After registering with jabber server with a
particular id, is there any possibility to change
one's jabber id, so that all his transports and roster
is automatically copied to new id. HOw can i
accomplish this task.
thanks.
