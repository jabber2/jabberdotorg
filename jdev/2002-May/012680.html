I've been working with open source systems sphinx2(speech in) and festival
(speech out). I've thought about making a jabber client using these. It is
hard to get myself to write it because personaly I don't think I would use
it(as I'm not blind). If I ever get something written I'll be sure to let
someone know, but for those that want to take up the challenge.

Sphinx: <A HREF="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/">http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/</A>
Festival: <A HREF="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/</A>

Sphinx would be perfect to handle the commands, such as &quot;Jabber Send
Message To Contact Five&quot;.  It picks up words from a list. It wouldn't work
well to type out messages from voice, as its vocabulary is
limited.

Festival would work good to read messages sent to them by others.

I've been working on some voice command stuff with sphinx and perl, I
would be willing to send in patches from time to time but not startup and
be a main developer of such a project.

I just wanted to point some options that are availible to someone working
on this. Is anyone on the list familar with common software used by the
blind, or is there such a thing?
