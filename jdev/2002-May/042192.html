<PRE>Hi,

Did you have any response to this?  Here is what I have learned.

You cannot maintain a connection through an HTTP proxy server, except by 
one method.  A standard request through HTTP proxy must be an HTTP 
request, so you cannot continue to stream XML through it, because the 
proxy server will drop your connection when it realizes.

The one workaround is to use SSL and tell the proxy server to forward 
your connection by using an HTTP request of the form

CONNECT &lt;jabber server name or ip&gt;:&lt;jabber ssl port&gt; HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n

In this way, you are tunnelling SSL through the proxy server, and it 
doesn't know that you are using XML and not HTTP.  This is called 
CONNECT tunneling, and is described in section 5.2 of RFC 2817 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2817.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2817.txt</A>

Most proxy servers have an inactive timeout of 5 minutes or less, so 
make sure to set up a pinger or something.  Some HTTP proxies also 
restrict outbound SSL to port 443, for which you could have your jabber 
server listen for SSL on 443.

The other solution to the HTTP proxy is to write a protocol to access 
the Jabber server over HTTP.  Some people were working on this, I'm not 
sure what's going on now.  You might find more information on jabber.org.

Good luck!
