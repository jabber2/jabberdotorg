  &lt;body&gt;You're completely right -- a few bytes every few
minutes would be intolerable for all those low bandwidth
users.  The finely tuned bandwidth efficient jabber protocol
would be brought, yea, to its very knees!&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/stream&gt;
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

I personally like the idea of guaranteed message delivery as an
end around this problem, although it seems clear that ping/pong or
Ben's register-a-timeout method would work out ok.

Another poster couldn't figure out how to get guaranteed message
delivery to work, but it's actually pretty simple:

1.  User sends guaranteed message, with checksum, retry count,
and what-to-do-if-it-gets-stuck.
2.  Server receives message, verifies that it's OK.
3.  Server optionally passes it on to any intermediate servers,
handshaking to make sure that the message is received before
deleting it from local store.
4.  If the message is received successfully by the next server
in the chain, the delivery responsibility passes to that next
server, and the local server deletes it.
5.  If the message can't be passed to the intermediate server,
the what-to-do-if-it-gets-stuck field is examined (possible
values might include delete-with-notification, retry-for-a-certain-
number-of-times, etc.)
6.  Upon receipt, you're done.

Note that this was guaranteed message delivery, rather than 
return-receipt.  With return-receipt, you just have the recipient
fire off a guaranteed message back declaring success.  Just never
have return receipts require return receipts.. ;)

</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that you are trying to solve this issue in the

</I>&gt;<i> protocol will have to be adjusted to have clients send 
</I>&gt;<i> notification when a message is delivered (like 
</I>&gt;<i> return-receipts in email, but hopefully more intelligent). In 
</I>&gt;<i> fact, I would argue that guaranteed message delivery should 
</I>&gt;<i> be the responsibility of the client rather than the server. 
</I>&gt;<i> Modifiying the server to provide this functionality brings up 
</I>&gt;<i> the question of &quot;what is the appropriate behavior if a 
</I>&gt;<i> message isn't deliver?&quot; Should the server put the message in 
</I>&gt;<i> offline storage? Bounce an error message? What happens if 
</I>&gt;<i> offline storage isn't configured on the receiving party's server?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, I do agree that faulty presence is an 
</I>&gt;<i> issue. I hate messaging people and then realize that they 
</I>&gt;<i> aren't actually online. My only goal is that we keep this 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion focused. You will *NOT* solve lost message issues 
</I>&gt;<i> with a ping/pong solution, however, you might be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> provide better presence reliability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, I'm afraid that I'd have to side with Dave
