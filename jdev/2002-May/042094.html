state chart!! cool...would love to see one :)

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> PACKET: &lt;this is=&quot;a&quot; tag=&quot;hello world&quot;&gt;packet&lt;/this&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> PACKET 1:&lt;thi

</I>&gt;<i> PACKET 3:cket
</I>&gt;<i> PACKET 4:&lt;/this&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> ...it's not at all clear when a good time to call parse() is.  It looks like
</I>&gt;<i> in order
</I>&gt;<i> to deal with XML streams, one would essentially have to pre-parse the XML
</I>&gt;<i> stream to find the closing tag's last character, bundle that up into a
</I>&gt;<i> buffer and
</I>&gt;<i> parse that, and then start some more.  Is that accurate?  If not, where am I
</I>&gt;<i> being
</I>&gt;<i> dumb?  If so, isn't that annoyingly painful?
</I>
My solution to this problem was to hack a TCP/IP input stream for the
XercesC parser. Use SAX and use the tokenized parsing functions. This
essentially offloaded all those issues into XercesC so I didnt' have to
worry about it :)



&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  This is more a plaintive bleat than a question: why are there about ten
</I>&gt;<i> different 60% complete C/C++ libraries, dammit? :)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>
My (probably way off-base) reason why there are a bazillion C++
libraries none of which are complete:

1. completeness is relative ;)
2. one size does not fit all.

yeah, re-use is nice... but a lot of the time its a myth propagated by
academics. trade-offs are what the real issues are... and I think the
major jabber C++ libraries do a good job filling their own trade-off
niche.
