Sorry, I would (IMHO) disagree on this. I think MSN wins from ICQ, Yahoo 
Messenger/Jabber the same way Internet Explorer &quot;won&quot; from Netscape: 
Internet Explorer was pre-installed with Windows '95 (or was it '98?). 
Why would people need another browser?

Then, later on, you could get a free hotmail e-mail account (like me, I 
got my e-mail before I knew about the &quot;hype&quot; MSN Messenger). A lot of 
people didn't knew about MSN Messenger or a passport. In windows Me, MSN 
is pre-installed... &quot;hmm, I can use my e-mail adres to chat, well, I'll 
give it a try&quot;...

 &gt; MSN Messenger is BY FAR a better client for the majority of Internet
 &gt; users than any of ours, and arguably better than AOL.

I think I must agree on this one: MSN Messenger doesn't have the 
overfeatered ICQ-style, but still offers good, usable features.

 &gt; They are also a LOT more &quot;open&quot; than AOL and Yahoo, even if not
 &gt; formally.  If anyone had a monopoly here, it was/is AOL, and they are
 &gt; trying to weild it as much as they can.  A year from now, when MSN has
 &gt; made their client an also ran, AOL and their cronies will go crying to
 &gt; the Fed that MSFT bullied them, when what really happened is that AOL
 &gt; acted like a bunch of babies trying to block and close off all
 &gt; other-client access and stop all interesting application development
 &gt; on their platform.  The question for us is which camp are we going to
 &gt; be in, the ones who bitch about msft or the ones who embrace and
 &gt; extend the embracers-and-extenders.

Sorry, English isn't my native language, what do you mean with &quot;the ones 
who embrace and extend the embracers-and-extenders?&quot;.

 &gt; We do have the advantages you state, and the more we make ourselves
 &gt; play nice with the major clients, the better those advantages seem
 &gt; because they won't have the disadvantages of not playing with MSN Ebay
 &gt; alerts (for example).

Sorry, but what are MSN Ebay alerts?

 &gt; Us bashing MSFT is sort of like the Red Sox bashing the Yankees.  If
 &gt; we had won more in the last 80 years, we wouldn't care about the damn
 &gt; Yankees. :)
