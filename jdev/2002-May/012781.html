Well, after a quick read through the docs, i have to say: i hate it!

i don't know if it would improve the security, propably it would on the
network level, but the idea of storing plaintext passwords scares me.
The problem with secure authentication is that the weak point moves from
one place to another. this way you would be unable to crack one account,
but by gaining access to the host itself, you would get all the
passwords, which i consider to be a huge thing (as many people do use
the same password in many places) but of tracking back with the e-mail
addresses entered for the accounts and you would be able to crack a few
new hosts.

Ugly!

the best method for this is to secure the transfer of the passwords as
well as possible.
