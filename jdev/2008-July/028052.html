</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Moreover I think I have some spare time for this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yet I want to be sure of all the implications of being a member. So at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the end what does it mean? What do this membership requires from us? I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't see so much information about the internal organisation of XSF
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (but maybe I am not looking on the right places too).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;responsibilities&quot; of XSF members are described here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/members/responsibilities.shtml">http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/members/responsibilities.shtml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> XSF members don't really do much. :) They need to vote 5 times a year 
</I>&gt;<i> (four times a year on whether to accept new members, once a year on the 
</I>&gt;<i> composition of the XMPP Council and the XSF Board of Directors). Plus 
</I>&gt;<i> you need to be an XSF member in order to be on the XMPP Council.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The basic idea is that XSF needs members in order to provide a legal 
</I>&gt;<i> structure for its standardization activities -- it is a membership 
</I>&gt;<i> organization in which the individual members are elected based on merit, 
</I>&gt;<i> and those meritorious individuals in turn elect the board and council. 
</I>&gt;<i> The IETF does something similar but in a more complicated way (IMHO). 
</I>&gt;<i> Many other standards organizations have member *companies* and require 
</I>&gt;<i> large payments from those companies (W3C, OASIS, OMA, etc.), but you can 
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to their standards process only if you work for one of those 
</I>&gt;<i> companies. Although the XSF has sponsoring companies, they don't have 
</I>&gt;<i> any special status, and XSF membership is *individual*, not corporate. 
</I>&gt;<i> The XSF prefers to work completely in the open, so we don't require any 
</I>&gt;<i> payments in order to participate. However, that means we don't have 
</I>&gt;<i> fancy meetings in Hawaii and Barcelona (etc.) like other standards 
</I>&gt;<i> groups do, instead we just hold our small &quot;XMPP Summit&quot; meetings at 
</I>&gt;<i> FOSDEM and OSCON every year. ;-) Thus we do almost all of our work via 
</I>&gt;<i> email lists and groupchat rooms, which are pretty cheap to host.

BTW I updated the following pages to reflect this thread:

<A HREF="http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/members/">http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/members/</A>

<A HREF="http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/members/responsibilities.shtml">http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/members/responsibilities.shtml</A>

I hope that makes things clearer.
