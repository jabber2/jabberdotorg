Maybe send the auto-response only once during the thread?

Or not send auto-responses at all. If someone can't read in my status
I'm DND, will he be able to read it from a message? It is only duplicate
information. If someone feels he needs it repeated in the chat window,
let his (not remote) client do that.

&gt;<i> I often understand DND as a state where I can interrupt other to ask some

</I>
I take DND as &#8222;No useless talking like wanna go for a drink, but I'm
here, if it is really important (like your house is on fire), it is
ok)&#8220;.

Have a nice day
