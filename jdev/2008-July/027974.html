No, we tried that and it was confusing (once upon a time XSF members 
voted on whether to issue Last Calls, but then the technical discussions 
happened on the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">members at xmpp.org</A>, which is open only to elected members, 
not the general public). So all XEP-related discussion happens on the 
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">standards at xmpp.org</A> list now, which is completely open. The members list 
is in fact very quiet. :)

&gt;<i> As Kev said, yes, you have to participate in the community actively
</I>&gt;<i> (which includes discussions about XEPs). 'Participating actively' is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty vague, though, and the only well-defined task is the voting
</I>&gt;<i> part, which is probably why Kev mentioned it first. (And as simple as
</I>&gt;<i> this task may seem, it seems that some members still fail to take it
</I>&gt;<i> seriously)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When members need to vote, there is always a time span, and the last
</I>&gt;<i> moment to vote is the members meeting (which typically happens around
</I>&gt;<i> 1900 CET). However, you if you vote during the time span, there is no
</I>&gt;<i> need for you to physically attend the meeting.

Right, usually you have 2 or 3 weeks to vote via the bot.
