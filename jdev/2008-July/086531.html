<PRE>That's a good point about dealing with non-XEP-0033 clients. But from my 
point-of-view I'm only concerned with getting /a/ solution - if that 
means requiring users here to use only pidgin (or whatever client) to 
get full benefit, that's ok. Graceful interaction with non-XEP-0033 
clients, while desirable, isn't a priority, I just need to be able to 
say &quot;here's a way to get the job done&quot;.

I'm not familiar enough with XMPP to know exactly what's possible purely 
on the client side and what requires a server component, so thanks for 
the advice. Maybe I need to be soliciting work on the pidgin 
developers'  list instead... :)

Thanks,

</I>&gt;<i> interoperability corner cases when working with other clients that don't
</I>&gt;<i> support XEP-0033.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At least, with the MUC case, if you're interacting with a client that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't provide that seamless user experience, it will &quot;gracefully&quot; fall
</I>&gt;<i> back to giving a MUC invite to the user to confirm.  If you're
</I>&gt;<i> interacting with a client that doesn't support XEP-0033, your multi-way
</I>&gt;<i> flow of messages isn't going to work the way I think you want/expect it
</I>&gt;<i> to.  (ie, you send a XEP-0033 message to two people; one of them, with a
</I>&gt;<i> non-XEP-0033 client, responds, and the message only comes to you, and
</I>&gt;<i> not also to the other user...correct me if I'm wrong on this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect this is why you haven't seen wide adoption of XEP-0033 as its
</I>&gt;<i> usefulness is largely dependent on other clients implementing it as
</I>&gt;<i> well...its the age-old bootstrapping problem.
