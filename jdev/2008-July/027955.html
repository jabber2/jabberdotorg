Again, its quite possible for a client to do this.  The protocol
(particularly with the &lt;continue/&gt; element) has the necessary bits and
parts to let the client know that it should be a seamless
transition...both on the initiating, and receiving side.

This is all client implementation issue.

You are correct, though, in that you could use XEP-0033 capabilities to
do this as well...though I suspect you're going to find a lot more
interoperability corner cases when working with other clients that don't
support XEP-0033.

At least, with the MUC case, if you're interacting with a client that
doesn't provide that seamless user experience, it will &quot;gracefully&quot; fall
back to giving a MUC invite to the user to confirm.  If you're
interacting with a client that doesn't support XEP-0033, your multi-way
flow of messages isn't going to work the way I think you want/expect it
to.  (ie, you send a XEP-0033 message to two people; one of them, with a
non-XEP-0033 client, responds, and the message only comes to you, and
not also to the other user...correct me if I'm wrong on this).

I suspect this is why you haven't seen wide adoption of XEP-0033 as its
usefulness is largely dependent on other clients implementing it as
well...its the age-old bootstrapping problem.
