</I>I'd have thought that rested very specifically with the board, not  
the council.

That said, how did you contact the council? I don't remember anything  
on the Council list, for example.


&gt;<i> btw: XMPP banners are another thing on my TODO list (can take some
</I>&gt;<i> time!), I also already contacted the XSF Council about this matter,
</I>&gt;<i> but so far there is no feedback, again. So if nothing happens, there
</I>&gt;<i> will be a banner campaign using the XMPP logo by the Coccinella
</I>&gt;<i> project. Not as official as such a campaign by the XSF, but it makes
</I>&gt;<i> no sense to wait forever...
</I>
Again, I don't personally recall any contact, so that would explain  
the lack of feedback on my part, at least...

But again, this would be a board matter - you ought to re-raise this  
on the XSF's Members list, or send it to the XSF Board list directly.  
  The Council is intended for technical matters, and what we call the  
protocol doesn't impact interoperability at all.  Besides, the amount  
of waffling we do over stuff we're *meant* to be discussing is quite  
enough.

Further discussion about what to call the protocol, what icon to use,  
etc, may invoke a total failure on my part to take anything  
seriously, for which I apologise in advance - Sander's suggestion  
that the XSF could do some more traditional advertising might,  
however, be a quite sensible thing to discuss.

Dave.
