<PRE>Hi,

(reposted to dev because I'm an idiot).

I told you not to listen to me...


&gt;<i> His scenario was basically:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Two (presumably) mutually subscribed resources, A and B.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A is in Do Not Disturb. B isn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A sends B a message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - B responds with another message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A responds to B's reply with an auto-responder whining about  
</I>&gt;<i> being disturbed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of things strike me here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) A really shouldn't be auto-responding to a response.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) This could be simplified if, when sending the initial message, A  
</I>&gt;<i> sent directed presence to B.
</I>
I was wondering if there is a potential use for the forgotten  
&lt;thread&gt; but I can't make that case yet.

Maybe directed presence in the context of a thread.

Just throwing stuff in the air...


&gt;<i> 3) Auto-responders, and possibly automatic messages in general,  
</I>&gt;<i> really ought to be marked as such, to avoid an even worse case,  
</I>&gt;<i> where B promptly auto-responds back, and a messaging loop occurs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As it happens, in this particular case, B was in fact a bot, and  
</I>&gt;<i> cheerfully posted the autoresponse to (at least) Jaiku. It wasn't  
</I>&gt;<i> Pedro's bot, incidentally, not that it really matters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was curious as to what developers thought about the situation,  
</I>&gt;<i> and whether any clients do in fact send directed presence to roster  
</I>&gt;<i> people when in states such as dnd.
</I>
I think client authors should look at the disco reply of each JID. If  
I announce that I'm a

&lt;identity category=&quot;client&quot; type=&quot;bot&quot; /&gt;

you really shouldn't be sending me auto-replies.

I think that if client authors respect this, you won't need anything  
else.

But I would like to see automatic messages marked somehow anyway,  
maybe a &lt;x xmlns=&quot;urn:xmpp:automatic-message' /&gt;. This would allow me  
to influence the display of such messages (and other things like  
don't store them in the archive).


&gt;<i> Finally, if dnd really does mean Do NOT Disturb At All Ever, then  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in raised-eyebrow territory, because I thought it meant Do Not  
</I>&gt;<i> Disturb Unless Important - since if you really don't want to be  
</I>&gt;<i> disturbed, then there's that &quot;unavailable&quot; presence type. But  
</I>&gt;<i> what's important is tricky - so perhaps it's an application of  
</I>&gt;<i> XEP-0155, and we negotiate that between clients.
</I>
Offline is different. Offline is &quot;not available&quot;. DND is &quot;available  
if you have agreed with me when its ok to interrupt me&quot;. It's  
probably the state with most social baggage we have, because it  
really depends on a lot of cultural baggage specific to each person.

I often understand DND as a state where I can interrupt other to ask  
some stuff for the task that I'm doing. And I'm willing to accept  
back responses, so it should be accompanied by a direct presence  
perhaps.

But really, this is a place where clients can be better: I can see a  
client that sends to offline storage the messages that where sent  
while on DND and when you change back to available you get &quot;Welcome  
back, dave. You had 4 contacts trying to reach you while you where  
out. Care to see a summary of their messages?&quot;.

Also, chat windows opened to dnd contacts should have a big RED sign  
saying &quot;Are you felling lucky, punk?&quot;.

Best regards,
