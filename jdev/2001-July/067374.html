<PRE>Has anyone written a gateway between Jabber and two-way pagers like the 
hugely popular Motorola T900? These devices can apparently send messages 
nearly instantly among themselves, and can send and receive Internet 
email too.

It appears that the only way into the system from outside is via email, 
so I guess this would really be an SMTP gateway, perhaps similar to the 
one Al Sutton mentioned yesterday. I.e. an IM sent to the device would 
result in the gateway talking to the service's SMTP server, and the 
gateway would run its own SMTP server to accept incoming mail that would 
be instantly routed via Jabber. I would guess this would also work with 
cellphone text messaging (SMS) which has the same kind of email access.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any any presence feature in this 
system -- as far as I know, it's not possible to tell whether a user's 
pager is on and in range. But the system does queue incoming messages 
until the pager comes back online.

T900 info: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/GSS/CSG/direct_pagers/T900/">http://www.motorola.com/GSS/CSG/direct_pagers/T900/</A>&gt;. I'm 
probably going to buy one of these in the near future; I've held out 
against cellphones but in this case the geek appeal plus the low price 
($100 + $15/month) is too much to resist. Plus, they come in translucent 
colors...)
