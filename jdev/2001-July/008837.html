<PRE>If my mailbag wasn't already as huge as it is per day I would sign up, but I 
would love to support this in any way possible.  If you have questions, or 
they do, please point them my way.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DotGNU plans to do everything originally, meaning not simply copying
</I>&gt;<i> MS's framework. they want to do what .NET &quot;should be&quot;. i know, the name
</I>&gt;<i> is not very original. i don't particularly like it, but hey, that's
</I>&gt;<i> nothing new *--cough-- 'jabber' --cough--*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> for the past few days i have been advocating jabber to the developers
</I>&gt;<i> list (which is quite active), and making some really good headway. so
</I>&gt;<i> far no one has put up any objections to investigating it, and a few have
</I>&gt;<i> been really gung-ho about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but, that was just the easy part. now comes the difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if anyone here wants to help me, sign up to the DotGNU developers list,
</I>&gt;<i> and do a little bit of idea spouting. listen in to the problems they are
</I>&gt;<i> discussing, and pop in with how jabber can solve them. *please?*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> also, inform me of how jabber can help thm, or really neat things jabber
</I>&gt;<i> has potential for when it comes to web services and distributed
</I>&gt;<i> computing. fel free to tell me about SOAP, XML-RPC, a2a communication,
</I>&gt;<i> b2b, b2c, *p2p*! tell me about scaleability and stability. flexability
</I>&gt;<i> and security.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if you can help me out here, even just a little, it could mean getting a
</I>&gt;<i> major project that will soon be in every OSS developer's eyes to use
</I>&gt;<i> jabber. hopefully by building direcly off of jabber and using it to it's
</I>&gt;<i> full potential.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i understand jabber needs a lot of work, but it has the *potential* in
</I>&gt;<i> it's framework and protocol. that's the key thing. if i can convince
</I>&gt;<i> them to use it, and we can show them it's viable, then we will have
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of developers to put in the man hours to fill in the gaps with
</I>&gt;<i> jabber.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so please, give me some ammunition!
