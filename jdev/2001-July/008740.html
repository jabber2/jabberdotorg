I would completely agree.  I'd like a name that is evocative of the server 
purpose, does not start with or prominently feature a 'J' and does not 
contain jab or ber in it.

Sounds good to me.

Sorry to be even more of a web blanket, but is it bit premature to worry 
about names.  Shouldn't we build something first?  I would think that the 
primary developers should have the dubious pleasure of naming their 
creation and we won't know who they are until the project starts rolling...

ps - It would also be nice if the name was decided along with a mascot.  :)
