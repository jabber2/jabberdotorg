<PRE>We had some great discussions of this in the Foundation chat last Wednesday
with James Barry from Collabnet.  You can find this discussion at the
tail-end of the log:

This also looks like good fodder for the Roadmap survey.

A Java jabber server has been discussed previously.  I 
think it's a good idea and am up for participating.

There's probably some work we can share, at least early on, 
with the Jabelin project.  Non-implementation-specific 
things (requirements analysis, sequence diagramming) come 
to mind as common to both efforts.  As do security 
mechanisms, client-side and s2s test cases.  And any sort 
of protocol mods/extensions.  In a lot of ways, we'd be 
able to validate each others work (like if their server 
didn't work with our server, they clearly would have 
screwed things up :)

Plus, I think the guys doing Jabelin were pretty 
intricately involved in the jabberd implementation, so they 
have (hopefully) a pretty good idea of what worked and what 
didn't the first time around.

It does seem to be likely, at least to me, that a 
reimplementation is going to require a significant amount 
of protocol changes that can't simply be tacked onto the 
current protocol as &quot;:x:&quot; namespaces.  Politically, it will 
be easier to make these changes if we have 2 different 
server groups requiring the same changes.

Comments?
