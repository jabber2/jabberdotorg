<PRE>JabberCon Developer Sponsorship Update

The following was posted by <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">justin at jabber.org</A> via the Jabber DevZone web site (<A HREF="http://dev.jabber.org/">http://dev.jabber.org/</A>):



Dear Jabber Community Member,



For the past three months, I have been organizing the up-and-coming
JabberCon 2001 event with the intent to bring the community closer
together, and provide a forum and opportunity for individuals and
companies to share ideas and accelerate our combined goals.



In organizing the event, I have had to make some rather substantial
financial commitments on behalf of Jabber, Inc. to the Keystone
conference center with respect to room reservations, food commitments
etc.



As is prudent in these rather difficult financial times, I am
operating under a very strict mandate to financially perform at
break-even or better. I have absolutely no wiggle room on this
subject.



It has been my goal and intention, from the onset of this event, to
financially sponsor as many open source community developers as
possible. I have personally dedicated much of my time and energy over
the past several weeks to accelerate registration at the event, and
have been making good progress as of late.



While we have already a rather significant turn-out in terms of
company participation, we do not yet have enough full-paying
participants for me to begin full sponsorship of community developers,
which could cost as much as $2,000 per person.



As you should know by now, we are inviting all open project developers
to the show for a discounted fee which will just cover our cost of
$295 per person. Additionally, we are more than happy to provide you
with lodging in one of three rented homes that all of the Jabber, Inc.
people will be staying at. Furthermore, we would be happy to see about
renting a bus to assist people in their travel from Denver to Keystone
(75 miles up the mountain). However, until I am at a point whereby
registration allows me to begin full or even partial sponsorship, I am
not in a position to make commitments to individuals for travel
expenses.



As a member of the community, I am asking for your assistance and
participation in helping me help you. Your promotion of the show to
individuals and companies that have corporate sponsorship is the
fastest way for us to overcome our current challenges.



I suspect that we are going to have a great turnout at the show.
Unfortunately, if these paying individuals do not sign up early
enough, I will be unable to predict how many individuals we can
sponsor.



I'm open to ALL questions, comments, concerns or suggestions. We're in
this together.



Respectfully yours,



Andre Durand
Founder, Jabber, Inc.
