Wait! Does this mean that it will always be impossible to determine the 
actual JID of a chat participant, and all chats will be anonymous? Will 
it also become impossible to browse the room and see the real JIDs of 
the participants? (The draft does not mention this.)

If not, ignore the rest of this message :) and maybe you can explain in 
more detail what you meant above.

If so, then I strongly, strongly disapprove of this. Privacy can be 
useful if people really want to chat anonymously, but for the most part 
it's nice to know who it is you're chatting with, especially in a small 
chat among friends/coworkers. In particular, this 'feature' would really 
turn off any company thinking about deploying Jabber internally.

And no, setting your nick to your real name or telling people who you 
are in a message isn't good enough; it's best if the client itself 
knows, so it can show the correct buddy icon and otherwise make it clear 
that the chat participant is the same as the person in your buddy list. 
(Yes, my client does this.)
