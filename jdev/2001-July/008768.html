<PRE>    I wasn't going to bring this up, but I do feel the need.  This guy
obviously has nothing positive to contribute to this list.  While he has
tried to provide a sample app for pgmillard, he has never, thus far, said
ANYTHING but flamebait on this list.  He's now insulting all of us with the
below message.  (NO, I DON'T mean David.. I mean Karthik).  Perhaps his
grasp on english is causing issues, I'm not sure, but I for one would like
to either see him STOP with these types of remarks, or leave the list..

    And, on that note, I suppose, as is apperently customary, I must say..

    he he he he..
