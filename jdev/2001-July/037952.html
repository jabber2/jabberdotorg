<PRE>My primary focus for developing the Java Jabber server is ease of
installation &amp; configuration. I've seen numerous requests about problems in
jabberd.xml so I'm trying to make the system require the minimum level of
detail in a configuration file (possibly just the server name), and use
feratures within java (such as reflection) to figure out whats available.

On the security front, I've been looking at the use of digital signatures a
asymetric crytpography to improve trust relationships. The areas that affect
what you bring up are;

1) Client -&gt; Server: The use of signed digital certificates which are signed
by a known entity (possibly Jabber.com, and/or others), to verify the
servers name, IP, and any other details in a similar was as TLS.

2) Server -&gt; Server: The establishment to a key bank (possibly distributed)
in which jabber servers store their public keys, data then sent from server
A to server B can be encrypted by Server A using it's private key, send to
B, B can fetch A's public key from the key store, and decrypt the data. This
would give not only server to server message security, but also verification
of server A's identity.

I'm also keen on developing the idea of using a Jabber server as a central
authentication location so that 3rd party apps can make use of jabber for
authenticating users.

These are still only my ideas, and they haven't been discussed, so if you
have any comments I'd welcome them.

Any general comments should go through this list, but if you want to talk to
me specifically about something you can either mail me or try and grab me on
Jabber at <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">al at personalbuddy.com</A>
