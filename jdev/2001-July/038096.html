well, from the smtp angle, mr ted rolle is working on coding an smtp
transport for jabber, using jeremie's old code.

it is in beta stage, and some info can be found at my website, the
project's home: <A HREF="http://www.theoretic.com/jabbersmtp/">http://www.theoretic.com/jabbersmtp/</A>

note that for most pager messages, there is a small cost, is there not?
hm, actually now that i think of it, there usually isn't to *send* to
one, no... so it could be feasible...

ask ted (his email is at the site, i believe, if not, just ask me, i'll
get it for you), he can give you the status on the project.

</I>&gt;<i> It appears that the only way into the system from outside is via email, so I guess this would really be an SMTP gateway, perhaps similar to the one Al Sutton mentioned yesterday. I.e. an IM sent to the device would result in the gateway talking to the service's SMTP server, and the gateway would run its own SMTP server to accept incoming mail that would be instantly routed via Jabber. I would guess this would also work with cellphone text messaging (SMS) which has the same kind of email access.
