They probably won't need any of the advanced features proposed in this
thread for they don't know how to set up them or don't care.

Simple file transfer is possible with certain clients already (via HTTP or
whatever). If you want advanced transfer why not use some modified Direct
Connect version. Perhaps it is possible to write a Jabber component that
somehow interfaces to for example DCTC (<A HREF="http://ac2i.tzo.com/dctc/">http://ac2i.tzo.com/dctc/</A>) or some
other ready-made library. You can of course also implement this directly
into a client of your choice.

A component would be really cool:
- uploading/downloading files with standard HTTP file transfer
- deleting/administering files via Jabber messages
- searching via Jabber messages or search namespace

Well, this would be a bit tricky but this way any Jabber client could use
file sharing without any changes (or at least I hope so ;-).
