Ulrich -

Have you found that people actually want this functionality?? I had threads
properly implemented in Winjab a _LONG_ time ago, and every single user
complained about it. &quot;Why does a new window open up???&quot;. This was mostly
because other clients were not echo'ing my thread tag back. Thus, you end up
having a &quot;bucket&quot; chat window which receives all messages which have a blank
thread. Most of this could be avoided if the &lt;thread&gt; tag was mandatory for
message type=&quot;chat&quot; packets. I've long since gotten away from the idea of
trying to implement threads &quot;properly&quot; because of these reasons (other
clients).... Mostly, I just echo the last thread, and generate one when a
new conversation starts.

On a related note, many clients don't handle chatting w/ multiple resources
very well either. Again, this is an &quot;edge case&quot; IMO, but once that can be
important in certain vertical market applications.
