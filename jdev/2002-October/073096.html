<PRE>&gt;<i> Have you found that people actually want this functionality?? I had threads
</I>&gt;<i> properly implemented in Winjab a _LONG_ time ago, and every single user
</I>&gt;<i> complained about it. &quot;Why does a new window open up???&quot;. This was mostly
</I>&gt;<i> because other clients were not echo'ing my thread tag back. Thus, you end
</I>&gt;<i> up having a &quot;bucket&quot; chat window which receives all messages which have a
</I>&gt;<i> blank thread. Most of this could be avoided if the &lt;thread&gt; tag was
</I>&gt;<i> mandatory for message type=&quot;chat&quot; packets. I've long since gotten away from
</I>&gt;<i> the idea of trying to implement threads &quot;properly&quot; because of these reasons
</I>&gt;<i> (other clients).... Mostly, I just echo the last thread, and generate one
</I>&gt;<i> when a new conversation starts.
</I>
As a latecomer to the world of Jabber clients, my first instinct was that 
since it was not a requirement, and most clients didn't support it, that I 
would not bother supporting it either...

Also, the concept of thread start/end is up to the client.  What if I still 
have my window open, but my friend has for some reason closed/re-opened his?  
I don't want to have a new chat window on my end just because of my friend's 
behavior.

&gt;<i> On a related note, many clients don't handle chatting w/ multiple resources
</I>&gt;<i> very well either. Again, this is an &quot;edge case&quot; IMO, but once that can be
</I>&gt;<i> important in certain vertical market applications.
</I>
This is huge, I think, and deserves a catagory on the jabber.org clients 
listing page.
