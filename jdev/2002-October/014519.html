<PRE>I will echo this feeling.  Jarl has basically the same functionality. 
At one point it had real support, but it is very annoying to be chatting 
with someone and have a new window popup for them to say one line before 
they bounce back to their other client.

It's far better to just dump all of the chats from a person into the 
same window.  Better for conversation threads and better for screen clutter.

IMHO, the only useful place for the &lt;thread/&gt; tag is in normal messages 
where (like email) you can create a thread of messages.  But in chat, 
it's hard to carry on two conversations at one time.
