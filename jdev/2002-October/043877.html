<PRE>Hi,

although I don't have time to carefully read JEP-0052 about file transfer,
maybe I can give my end-user view on file transfer and file sharing. I
hope it  helps, if not, then I've put ideas in order for myself ;).

File transfer:
--------------
- ability to set speed of download/upload
- resumable
- break (or maybe this can be implemented as cancel + resume, I thought
I already saw this idea somewhere)

File sharing:
-------------
A lot of my friends wouldn't know how to set up an ftp-server, but a lot
of them use ICQ to share files with their contactlist. For the moment I
don't like ICQ's file sharing (apart from the fact that I don't like
ICQ), because it seems to lack some features.

- I would like to see/notified who's downloading from me...
- Ability to set speed of download/upload
- I would like to share a file or directory A with user <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jklm at server.com</A>
and <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">qqsdf at server.net</A>, file or directory B with <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">uip at server.org</A> and
nothing else with my other contacts.


Now I'm wondering if there are people who would like to see more
features than the ones I'm proposing (maybe some that I &quot;passively&quot;
(what a word) like too)...

greetings
Mattias.
