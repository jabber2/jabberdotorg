That maybe so that impatient people will just go and create their own 
anyway, but the legal problems still remain and if the JSF creates and 
promotes a protocol designed for people setup a file sharing system it 
could bring the JSF into the firing line, IMO it is a VERY bad idea to 
rush into a potentially very dangerous territory for the JSF just 
because people want something now and cant wait a little while to sort 
this stuff out and in doing so protect the JSF. I have seen this 
argument quite a lot that people will end up building their own 
incompatible solution if we dont do it right now, I dont believe that 
for one second, there might be the odd one but they will be in the 
minority, I could understand that if I was saying that the JSF should 
not do it at all, but im not im saying that we should wait a little 
while for the lawyers or whatever to make sure the JSF is protected 
against any kind of comeback standardizing this feature could cause.
