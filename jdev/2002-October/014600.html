<PRE>My own &quot;honest opinion&quot; is that file transfer should be implemented if we 
want Jabber to be a the perfect alternative to any of the current IMs out 
there. It's not because we start working on file transfer that we can't work 
on other parts as well.

I suggest that we create the protocol now, and implement it when we have 
time, but not make it a must in jabber clients and servers for the next year 
or two, so it'll have time to get properly implemented. For me, file transfer 
is ESSENTIAL in any client, and without it, I tend to flip flop from jabber 
to another client, which I find annoying, as well as frustrating that I don't 
get the green card to implement something universal.

And that's what I have to say.
