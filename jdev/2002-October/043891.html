Well, these are user interface issues, no need for new protocols.

In fact, exchanging IP addresses and establishing a transport channel
can be problematic in todays internet, with firewalls and NAT everywhere.
That problem is covered by JEP-0041, available at
<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0041.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0041.html</A>

And, while you are there, have a look at JEP-0052, file transfer. I
think, using that JEP, most of your ideas can be implemented. Of course,
some nice user interfaces are still needed.
