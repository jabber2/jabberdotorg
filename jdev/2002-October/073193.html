There are not any JEPs that already cover this, this discussion is about
file sharing, not file transfer, you need to read through it more properly,
file transfer is fine (i.e. someone specifically sending a particular file
from one person to another), but file sharing (providing a selection of
files people can browse through and download the ones they want) is a
serious potensial problem, also there are not currently any JEPs that cover
what was being discussed (file sharing), which by your statement that their
are indicates you did not even read the email.

Also in your opinion the RIAA problem maybe mute but they have had lots of
legal successes in the field of P2P (Napster, AIMster, etc etc), even if
they arnt going to win they can use their money to make the legal process so
drawn out that their opponent is crippled or bankrupted trying to fight the
case. So introducing file sharing could certainly become a problem for the
JSF if its not handled correctly.

Also there maybe nothing illegal of unethical about you creating a document
and distributing it, but there is when you start to distribute your MP3's,
Video files of movies, or software you may have, so unless you are
suggesting that we restrict Jabber file transfer so it cannot transfer said
copyrighted material and can only transfer documents (a very difficult task)
the problem still remains that without some legal stuff to protect the JSF
(a disclaimer or something) it could come into the RIAA and MPAA firing
line.

As David suggested go read this

<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/20010227_p2p_copyright_white_paper.html">http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/20010227_p2p_copyright_white_paper.html</A>

and check out the section - &quot;Lessons and Guidelines for P2P Developers&quot; for
their advice on the development of filesharing systems and services.
