<PRE>Hi Peter,

i have found the threading quite useful when talking with cerberus (the
bot). And some users really liked threading. However i ended up as you
said, with a bucket full of windows because most of the clients don't
support threads. I really think the thread tag isn't mandatory.

how ever i came to the solution that if a message has no thread tag,
then display it in the chat window with the thread id=&quot;&quot;. That solves
everything.

Especially in scenarios where i.e. staff communicates with services and
in particular with service bots thread really make sense. It is quite
sure that advanced users want to query stock informations from a service
in one window and do a research in another window using the same service
and translating in a third window. 


&gt;<i> On a related note, many clients don't handle chatting w/ multiple resources
</I>&gt;<i> very well either. Again, this is an &quot;edge case&quot; IMO, but once that can be
</I>&gt;<i> important in certain vertical market applications.
</I>
Handling multiple resources is an absolute must for a proper client.
Scenario I) Direct-CRM-System with a &quot;contact sales staff&quot; button on a
webpage, can be done through threads or resources.
Scenario II) Wireless messaging applications bundling (anonymous)
usergroups in one jid, distinguishing them through the resource.
Scenario III) Personal, personalized user agents acting for a user (i
have something in mind like a secretary bot on my handheld)

regards,
ulrich
