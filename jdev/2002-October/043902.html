<PRE>Am I getting year old mail ?? We *have* jeps that cover this stuff.
JOBS, JID streams... head on over to <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org">http://www.jabber.org</A> 

There is nothing illegal or unethical about me creating a document and
distributing it to people; file transfer. The RIAA argument is mute,
plain and simple.
