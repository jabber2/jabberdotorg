<PRE>I (as well as a lot of others) think that Jabber lacks a lot of publicity
(at least to end users). I personally think that there are a lot of
&quot;potentials&quot; out there, interested in the principle of an open IM-system,
but not knowing of it existence...

Now I thought that a sort of J-day could solve part of this problem. What
if there was 1 special day in the Jabber community, where developers as
well as end users, as well as magazines look forward too. Why? Just
because that day means an explosion of euhm, let us call it Jabber
&quot;stuff&quot;...

I think every developer tries to focus on a certain day. &quot;When my
vacation is over, I want to finish my skinnable client&quot;, &quot;When it's my
daughters birthday I want to finish the full implementation of JEP-045&quot;.
But why not focus on a J-day? Maybe then it would be better to focus on a
bugfree release of your client?

Then you have those people who are interested a lot in Jabber, but who
aren't developers. Still they want to help with the advocacy of Jabber,
they can write to computer magazines to say: &quot;Hey, last week it was J-day,
maybe it is a good time to write some article about Jabber, because a lot
of releases came out, you can find info there and there and I also want
to say this and that...&quot;. Then you maybe also see my point of having a
bugfree release at J-day. Lack of features is one thing, but constantly
having to reboot your system, just because there's a certain bug, well
that's euhm... well that's a pain in the ass for the end user...

(Computer) magazines will be pleased, because they will have something to
write about: they can talk about the principle of Jabber + they can
compare stable (-&gt;bugfree release) clients + ... Maybe it's time then
to have a thema about &quot;IM systems&quot; and if we are lucky, they might
even make a thema about &quot;Jabber&quot;, just Jabber...

And finally :), we get to the publicity: the end users who read those
magazines. Then you can only hope that there are enough &quot;potentials&quot;
between those end users...

I think that if you want to succeed with the concept of &quot;J-day&quot; that you
will have to make a(n everlasting?) hype of it: a countdown at jabber
websites, explanation of the goal, making a lot of publicity for J-day
itself a month (or some months) before J-day,...

Now, my two questions (you're lucky, if you answer &quot;no&quot; the first one, you
don't have to answer the second question :)):
1) Do you like this idea of having a J-day?
If you answer this questio, think about some &quot;world days&quot;, like the world
day for peace and the world day for animals... And if you &quot;meet&quot; such a
day, take a look at the news papers and magazines: chances are big that
they will have special attention to that particular day by publishing specific
articles...

2) What would be the perfect day for J-day?
- birth of the Jabber Software Foundation
- birth of the <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org">http://www.jabber.org</A>
- birth of Jeremie Miller?
- ???

greetings,
