A disavantage of this can be that users want file sharing and they can't 
wait for all that lawyers stuff. Most of the  client developers want 
their client to be the most used on the whole planet (I think this is a 
very normal way of thinking :) ).

Now, if you take the two together, maybe a lot of client developers will 
start to build their own, incompatible, (proprietary?) solutions for 
file sharing. &quot;Incompatible&quot;, because there is no support from the JSF...

just my 2 cents
