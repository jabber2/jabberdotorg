<PRE>Lars Kaufmann and I have an eye on it. Lars commented a few times. He is
the moderated groupchat person here. I think our main concern is that we
do not see the point in a fixed role hierarchy. Currently our roles are
attributes of the user and a user can have multiple attributes. 

The features of attributes/roles do not collide, so there is no problem
having multiple roles. Of course there are not yet many combinations
which make sense in the real world, but
1. there are and 
2. who knows. 

Example: user is admin and moderates and is invisible
Example: a user is admin of another channel and visitor. So he has an
icon which shows him as important (because he is admin somwhere else)
but still can not say anything, because he is only a listener here.

There might be more user features/behaviours which you want to control
by attributes/roles than what the you can do with the fixed hierarchy of
roles. Of course you can control things like visibiliy differently, but
since the attributes/roles are there, why not use the mechanism for more
than floor control. 

Other point is just about naming: The owner/admin terminology comes from
ICQ. But I would rather like the owner to be the one who owns the room
and creates admins. Admins the ones who control the room and create
moderators. Moderators the ones who moderate the room. 

So basically one level more with moderators moderating ad administrators
administering. The owner is usually not involved actively as a chatter.
That is usually the company which owns the server and configures the
room, so that the room knows the admin.

Hello there,

  As you may have seen, there is a lot of work currently underway on
  JEP-0045 ( <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0045.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0045.html</A> ) - why not look
  at that as i'm already seeing some overlap occuring, especially
  regarding user role.

Regards,

  David
