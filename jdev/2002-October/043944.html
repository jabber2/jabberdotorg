&gt;<i> 1)What is the minimum bandwidth a Jabber Client need to connect to the
</I>&gt;<i> Server???
</I>
0?  It depends upon how much chatting they do, how often they change
their presence, and the average roster size.  Typically, a message is
around 200 bytes, and a presence notification is about 100 bytes.
Since the socket stays open for a long time, there's not much overhead
there.  Averaged over time, the bandwidth is really small.

&gt;<i> 4) Is there any limit in the number of users that can be added to a
</I>&gt;<i> buddy list??? Why I am asking this is , Yahoo Messenger allows only a
</I>&gt;<i> maximum of 100 users and it asks to remove a buddy if we tries to add
</I>&gt;<i> 101th buddy. Is there any limitaiton in the Jabber Server.
</I>
No.  I think stpeter has 900+ people in his roster.  Yes, there is a
performance penalty associated with his logging in.  :)

&gt;<i> 6) Is there any open source clinet available for the Window
</I>&gt;<i> OS,preferably Visual Basic which is implementing the SMS transport of
</I>&gt;<i> the Jabber Technology????
</I>
Yes.  I haven't used any of them, so I'm not sure about completeness
of features.  Often people will start a VB client, because it's easy,
and get bored before they finish it, since doing software engineering
on that much VB6 code is... challenging.

&gt;<i> 7) Is there any C# or VB.NET open source client available using Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> Technology???
</I>
Well, this isn't a client, but a set of libraries you could use to build one:

Nexxia is a client built on top of those libraries: <A HREF="http://www.nureality.ca">http://www.nureality.ca</A>
