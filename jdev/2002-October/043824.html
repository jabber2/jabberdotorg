Subject: [JDEV] Jabber / Kannel


This is an appearantly simple (newbie) question... That maybe should have gone to a users list... But since we plan to start
developing I will jump in here right away.

I downloaded the sms transport for Jabber... We have just started out
using Jabber... so I am not completely familiar with it.

I compiled the transport and put the config-xml in jabber.xml.
Everything loads fine.

This may be a very silly question: But how do I go from now? I tried
adding &lt;phone&gt;@sms.&lt;ourhost&gt; as well as &lt;legal_username&gt;@sms.&lt;ourhost&gt; to my roster. As far as I understood, sending messages to the
latter should look up the phone # in the users' vCard?
Adding jid=&quot;sms.&lt;ourhost&gt;&quot; to the sms config didn't help either.

It says that the presence-subscription is pending... But messages that
are sent are not relayed to Kannel. Hostname, port, username, etc. are
set up correctly as far as I can see. The kannel-part works... I have
been using that around for some time... The sms.c code seems pretty
clean and straight forward... We are looking to extend it to bi-directional communication, once we got this working...

Looking back in the (kannel) logs, we can see that once a message is sent. I am not sure how we did this ;]...

What do I need to do to just send a message?

Kind regards,
