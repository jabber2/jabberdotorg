</I>&gt;&gt;<i>1) Do you like this idea of having a J-day?

</I>
Maybe for the developers (but I don't know much about those annual 
jabberconfs :( ), but I don't think for end-users.

Eg. take the &quot;world day of peace&quot;, it has nothing to do with Jabber of 
course, but take a search on google, it returned circa 3110 results 
(other languages excluded, because my search contained English words). 
Probably, a lot of those &quot;publication&quot; had been written specially for 
that day, to give &quot;peace&quot; a little bit more attention...

Now let's say that the Jabber community has a J-day in a way like &quot;world 
day of peace&quot;, with the explanation of its goal: &quot;giving Jabber a little 
bit more extra attention that very day&quot;. Maybe A nor D is interested in 
J-day, for them it's like another day... But it could be that B from 
Belgium en C from Germany and E from New York and ... are all interested 
in that day and they want to do sth. special like, they could contact 
their computer magazine to say &quot;Hey, it was J-day last week, now 
wouldn't that be a great opportunity for...&quot; and that in Belgium, 
Germany, New York,...

&gt;<i> anyway, jabber can't have too much publicity so yeah, this can be a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>2) What would be the perfect day for J-day?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>- birth of the Jabber Software Foundation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>- birth of the <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org">http://www.jabber.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> another possible perfect day : the first stable release of a jabber server (1.0 ?) ?
</I>
Maybe that a persons birthday (say Jeremie Miller) is psychologicaly (is 
that a correct word) the best? Suppose you are making a commercial movie 
about the 1st World War, then you won't focus on every person who could 
possibly suffored in that war, because you probably get more effect by 
focussing on 10 or maybe even 5 persons only... What I want to say is 
that &quot;Jabber Software Foundation&quot; are a collections of people, 
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org&quot;">http://www.jabber.org&quot;</A> is abstract as well as a &quot;jabber server&quot;. But 
the birthday of Jeremie Miller gives the oppurtunity to start a talk. 
Like a lot of people see &quot;Bill Gates&quot; as &quot;wauw and och&quot;, but Microsoft 
is much much more then Bill Gates...

Of course there probably are some thoughts against this 
&quot;personalisation&quot; of Jabber (like a world war has little to do with 
Jabber), so maybe that the first of April is a better date (from 
<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/about/overview.php:">http://www.jabber.org/about/overview.php:</A> The Jabber project was started 
by Jeremie Miller in early 1998, when he began developing the jabberd 
server. The first public notice of the project appeared at Slashdot on 
1999-01-04.)

greetings
Mattias.
