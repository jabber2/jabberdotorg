<PRE>And don't forget this part of their website:

<A HREF="http://www.integritymessenger.com/about.php">http://www.integritymessenger.com/about.php</A>

quote:
&quot;
It is that desire that has propelled Integrity Messenger to strive for 
excellence, and achieve industry first technologies never before seen 
in an Instant Messaging solution. **Many of the technologies within the 
Integrity Messenger are presently being filed for patent.** (my 
emphasis) 

Integrity Messenger would like to thank The Jabber Foundation at this 
time for allowing us to temporarily infrastructure our software on 
their server solution while we prepare to launch our own XML/SIP based 
server. Special thanks to David (the Founder) and Peter for their 
invitation to join their network.&quot; 

Justin, 
I use Psi a lot (it's my favorite client, keep up the godo work!) and 
I've &quot;converted&quot; many others to Jabber with it, use it for 
demonstrations etc. And ofcourse I'd like to let &quot;Integrety&quot; Messenger 
know how I feel about this. But even though it's obvious to me that 
they've used Psi sourcecode  I think before anyone should do such a 
thing there should be a write-up on this on the Psi website about what 
contacts/responses there have been. Besides that, most of us are 
curious about the FSF involvement too I think. :) 

In any case, good luck with it! It can't be nice to see someone else 
trying to sell all your hard work like this...
