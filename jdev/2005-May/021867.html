It all depends on how you look at a nickname. For me, a nickname is a  
static thing, which doesn't change (much), just as with the other  
VCard fields such as addresses, phone numbers, e-mails, etc.  
Moreover, persons changing their nickname constantly (as people are  
doing on MSN) is very confusing practice, as most of the time i fail  
to find these persons in my roster when i need them.

The way i see it, a person could want to change his nickname to  
reflect the state in which a person is, if that would accidentally  
have some likeliness to their nickname (for example, if 'spike' was  
going crazy, he might want to change it temporarily into 'psike').  
And in that case, i would just put that in my status message, as it  
reflects my status.

I guess you could make a pubsub JEP if you really want it.

cheers,
Remko
