Hi,

I think having a certification of libraries and servers makes a lot  
of sense.

Doing it for clients I think will only take a lot of time and not  
worth the effort. It's just not very interesting information for the  
user, but for a user of a server (server admin) and libraries  
(application developers) it's very interesting to see how the tools  
comply with the specifications.

I think that if we have some kind of review process for clients the  
only thing it should do is to decide whether the client is listed on  
the jabber.org web page or not.

Could also be a good idea to just list one preferred client for each  
OS though this is bound to create discussions. If I come as a new  
user and go to: <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.shtml">http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.shtml</A> I would  
most likely turn around there and go fetch ICQ or something, that  
list is daunting, or you can spend an entire weekend trying each of  
the clients for your operating system.

Just my thoughts,
   Mikael Hallendal

&gt;<i> We're having quite a debate on the JSF Members list today.
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://www.jabber.org/members/">https://www.jabber.org/members/</A>) The main topic is
</I>&gt;<i> certification of open-source Jabber projects.  There are at least two
</I>&gt;<i> types of certifications being discussed, and I'll go over them very
</I>&gt;<i> briefly:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Certification.  You would have several levels.  I'm proposing the
</I>&gt;<i> bare minimum would be 100% XMPP compliance.  Beyond that you would
</I>&gt;<i> have multiple levels, and some would be pertinent to clients, others
</I>&gt;<i> to servers, and perhaps still others would apply to tools, libraries,
</I>&gt;<i> and other categories.  An example is that you can get your XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> button, and if you like, go for a Silver ribbon which means you meet
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP, plus Basic and Intermediate IM Suite JEPs. (That's a totally
</I>&gt;<i> made up example, no real decisions have been made at this oint.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Official JSF Projects.  This proposal would entail the JSF voting
</I>&gt;<i> on naming multiple projects, as &quot;official&quot;.  It would be a badge of
</I>&gt;<i> honor.  It's assumed (by me anyway) that you would have to meet some
</I>&gt;<i> level of certification to become eligible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why am I telling you this?  Well Rachel tells us that she and Julian
</I>&gt;<i> tried to get certification going a while ago and it went down in
</I>&gt;<i> flames when brought up here on JDEV.  So, let it be known that round
</I>&gt;<i> #2 of certification is coming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on the outline I've given above (which again is just based on a
</I>&gt;<i> single day of discussion) would you just absolutely freak out if this
</I>&gt;<i> were to be implemented?  Or would you say &quot;about time!&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -1 / 0 / +1 ?
