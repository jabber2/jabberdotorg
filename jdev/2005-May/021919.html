<PRE>Sorry for being slightly naive on this but, are you on about a Basic 
cert. based on compliance to the Core XMPP documents and then assigning 
extra points for additional JEPs covered?

All this phrasing of &quot;levels of cert.&quot; leads me to think of something in 
the order of Bronze,Silver,Gold,Plat. certs.
Personaly I chose clients based on the fact that it covers my limited 
needs in a easy to use form. Now I know different people have different 
ideas of useable, so that's not something you can grade, but could you 
not just say that Client XYZ is 95% XMPP core + 100% JEP-12342223, 
JEP-2342345563 compliant.

So that's a certification for XMPP core + certs for each seperate JEP.  
A friendly table at this point would be good :)

So basic IM clients/libs/servers could get the certs that refrlect why 
they were created instead of being classed as inferior due to the fact 
that they do 1-2 things very well instead of 10 things done okay. Some 
of us like minimal software.
