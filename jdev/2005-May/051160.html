<PRE>&gt;<i> It all depends on how you look at a nickname. For me, a nickname is a 
</I>&gt;<i> static thing, which doesn't change (much), just as with the other  VCard 
</I>&gt;<i> fields such as addresses, phone numbers, e-mails, etc.  Moreover, persons 
</I>&gt;<i> changing their nickname constantly (as people are  doing on MSN) is very 
</I>&gt;<i> confusing practice, as most of the time i fail  to find these persons in 
</I>&gt;<i> my roster when i need them.
</I>
Yea which is why my pubsub proposal is good, for the people who dont want to 
receive their friends updated nicknames they simply dont subscribe to 
receive updates, but for those of us who do want them we can get them, 
everybody wins, which is why I find it so strange that people are still 
against it.

&gt;<i> The way i see it, a person could want to change his nickname to  reflect 
</I>&gt;<i> the state in which a person is, if that would accidentally  have some 
</I>&gt;<i> likeliness to their nickname (for example, if 'spike' was  going crazy, he 
</I>&gt;<i> might want to change it temporarily into 'psike').  And in that case, i 
</I>&gt;<i> would just put that in my status message, as it  reflects my status.
</I>
Yup but not all of these things that people use MSN nicknames for all fit 
into jabber status, status to me would be my actual upto the minute status, 
whereas I might want to change my nickname for some reason, thats part of 
the fun of MSN nicknames.

&gt;<i> I guess you could make a pubsub JEP if you really want it.
</I>
I already did its at:
