<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> didn't Apple went for this on iChat and decided to store the avatar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the user's vcard-tmp ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Simply because pubsub isn't widely deployed yet, and they had to ship
</I>&gt;<i> with something. Many people have commented on iChat's  
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> various Jabber protocols, so I won't repeat that here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes I understand what Apple did. But the point is: there was JEP-0084  
and it's pointed at <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jeplist.shtml">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jeplist.shtml</A> to use  
with Avatars and they decided not to use it, while we decided the  
contrary (despite the problems with it). Now I have a client that  
won't interoperate with iChat and either I change it to vcard-temp  
and release a new version just for the sake of the Tiger user's joy  
or wait for pubsub and it's wide adoption and migrate everything.  
Even if at a much smaller scale, I have to take the same kind of  
decisions Apple did. My initial suggestion was simply  that JSF could  
have a recomendation sheet (call it counseling, maybe it's a better  
word I don't know sorry for the bad english) on how to implement the  
various IM functions, even if the solutions aren't perfect or  
advisable, maybe with an overview of what's avaialable and what's to  
come (ie: pubsub). That would help and clear things on time-to-market  
decisions and hopefully increase interoperability between clients.

Celso.
