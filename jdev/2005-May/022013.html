<PRE>Hi Shuaib,

It looks like you need a asynchronous message router where different
entities(user, apps, devices) get connected to this message router to
exchange messages in async fashion.

Jabber protocol does the same &amp; more precisely you can use J-EAI as message
bus. Here you can plug-in all your users, devices, apps with J-EAI to
exchange messages in async fashion.

J-EAI routing algorithms are :

- Point-to-point communication, through the server
- Direct point-to-point message exchange from client to client
- Channel-based publish &amp; subscribe mechanism (conforms to JEP-0060)
- Message pattern-based publish &amp; subscribe mechanism based on XPATH

You can find out more details at

Hi Alex,
Thanks for the response.
We are building a personal information management system, which will manage
the user's lifetime information semantically. Our project's name is
SemanticLIFE. Following is our SW design:
There are various components , e.g., Data feed (capture and stores the
diverse range of user's data, e.g., emails, browsed web sessions, processes
running on his machine, and any file he want to upload such as photos,
movies, .doc, .jpeg etc. etc.), analysis engine (analysing the stored
entities in previous step and finding semantic relations between the
information. Now the dumb information captured in first step will be stored
again semantically, i.e., as ontologies), Query, Storage and some others,
besides the main component MessageHandler which is the entry point of our
core machine. Every module sends the data as an XML message to the Message
Handler which then routes it to the appropriate component by looking at some
header field, after adding time stamp and a unique message id.
By asynchronous messaging, what i mean is that the sender componet should
not get blocked after sending a message for waiting its response, which
might take some time. Consider two components c1, c2 communicating via
message handler. c1 sends message to c2, and forgets about the response.
After certain time, when c2 accomplishes his job for c1's message, it send
the response message (original request message from c1 is also encapsulated
within) to c1 via message handler. Now c1 should retrieve that message from
its queue and process it.
There are some other solutions too for accomplishing this architecture such
as jms publish-subscribe, jade agent development framework etc. But we are
searching a lightweight and efficient solution.


Sorry for the lengthy mail!

With thanks and best regards,

Shuaib
