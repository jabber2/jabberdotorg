I've been getting more heavily involved with CAcert.org, and the number
of assurers for CAcert is starting to take off. This enables people all
over the world to acquire domain certificates without paying large sums
of money to commercial certificate authorities.

Having a cert from a commercial CA proves that you once possessed a few 
hundred dollars and now that money is in the bank account of the CA.

Having a cert from CAcert proves that you met with some assurers (or
other trusted third parties, such as public notaries in the U.S.) and
those people compared two of your government-issued identity documents 
with your real-life person and affirmed that they identify one and the
same person.

We can debate which of these approaches is superior, but I rather like
the CAcert approach because it is based on something more significant
than paying X dollars to some company. Plus it is open to people who
could not otherwise afford a domain-level certificate (there are lots 
of Jabber servers in places like Belarus and Indonesia, where $200 for 
a cert is a *lot* of money).

Outside of CAcert, XMPP servers could of course also trust the same CAs 
that are trusted by, say, Mozilla (see tthe old and perhaps infamous 
ca-bundle.crt file that was originally created by exporting the trusted 
root CAs from Communicator 4.72, I think).
