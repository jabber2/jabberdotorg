<PRE>Hi Alex,
Thanks for the response.
We are building a personal information management system, which will manage 
the user's lifetime information semantically. Our project's name is 
SemanticLIFE. Following is our SW design:
There are various components , e.g., Data feed (capture and stores the 
diverse range of user's data, e.g., emails, browsed web sessions, processes 
running on his machine, and any file he want to upload such as photos, 
movies, .doc, .jpeg etc. etc.), analysis engine (analysing the stored 
entities in previous step and finding semantic relations between the 
information. Now the dumb information captured in first step will be stored 
again semantically, i.e., as ontologies), Query, Storage and some others, 
besides the main component MessageHandler which is the entry point of our 
core machine. Every module sends the data as an XML message to the Message 
Handler which then routes it to the appropriate component by looking at some 
header field, after adding time stamp and a unique message id.
By asynchronous messaging, what i mean is that the sender componet should 
not get blocked after sending a message for waiting its response, which 
might take some time. Consider two components c1, c2 communicating via 
message handler. c1 sends message to c2, and forgets about the response. 
After certain time, when c2 accomplishes his job for c1's message, it send 
the response message (original request message from c1 is also encapsulated 
within) to c1 via message handler. Now c1 should retrieve that message from 
its queue and process it.
There are some other solutions too for accomplishing this architecture such 
as jms publish-subscribe, jade agent development framework etc. But we are 
searching a lightweight and efficient solution.


Sorry for the lengthy mail!

With thanks and best regards,

Shuaib

&gt;<i> hi Shuaib,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am exploring Jabber for using in our project, which consists of various 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software modules on the server. These module need to communicate with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each other in an asynchronous fashion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone tried to use jabber for above mentioned scenario. The site 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generally covers information about instant messaging b/w chat clients. Is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it suitable for the job i mentioned.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If yes, then what can be the right starting point for accomplishing the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asynchronous messaging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> what exactly do you mean with asynchronous messaging? Could you give us 
</I>&gt;<i> more info about your software design?
</I>&gt;<i> I think it will be no problem to use jabber/xmpp in your project. Your 
</I>&gt;<i> server could act like a jabber server and accept one client connection 
</I>&gt;<i> from each of your software modules. You could also use the component 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol (JEP-0114 [*])
