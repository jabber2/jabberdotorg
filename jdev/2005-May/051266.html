Well, I suggest doing some research on the matter of root CAs. The
existing root CA lists were decided upon in a rather arbitrary fashion
(the ca-cundle.crt file you see floating around was defined back in the
year 2000 or whatever and has not changed since), and I think Netscape
didn't really have an official policy on the matter. CAcert's request to
be added to the Mozilla list has exposed the fact that there really were
no policies in effect before -- now they are being defined. The WebTrust
stuff can be seen as an effort to circle the wagons and prevent new
entrants into the CA market (especially inexpensive entrants). In fact
there are many many questions one could raise about the conflicts of
interest in the existing CA universe, the ethical status of VeriSign,
and much more. To reduce the question to &quot;I'll trust whatever Mozilla
trusts&quot; simplifies the decision for you but then you have abdicated
judgment.
