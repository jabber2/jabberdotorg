That would be interesting. Unfortunately the JSF has never taken upon  
itself a more active role in real time-to-market things.. it's always  
been about setting future protocol. I'm afraid it would take a lot of  
changes to get something like that... and that's not going to happen  
without a lot of argument.

For example, why recommend anything other than jep-0084? Obviously  
the problem with lack of adoption is that no one has built all the  
software for it yet, so if we recommend it people will build the  
software. So why not simply recommend jep-0084 and get people to  
build that software?
