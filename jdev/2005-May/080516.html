Well, see, this last bit is why it was Jabber convention. There are a  
lot of parsers out there which are still not namespace-aware, so  
having everything use &lt;x/&gt; makes their lives easier. I never said  
*everything* in Jabber uses it or *everything* in the future must use  
it. I was simply stating that it is Jabber convention. There are  
indeed newer JEPs which don't follow that convention, but there are  
also new JEPs which do follow the convention.

I won't pretend to care whether people follow this convention or not  
(gee, you might even find my name on popular JEPs which don't use &lt;x/ 
 &gt;), I was simply informing him why a bunch of people were going to  
say it's &quot;wrong&quot; to not have it in &lt;x/&gt; and then a bunch of other  
people will say its &quot;wrong&quot; to use &lt;x/&gt;. Both types of replies have  
been made ad nauseam to this thread already, so it looks like it was  
a good move on my part to let the initial poster know.

Calm down everyone, it's not like I do anything Jabber-related except  
whine.

Julian
