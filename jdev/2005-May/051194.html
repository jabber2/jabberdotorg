<PRE>I think certification is a good idea. Having a suite of tools for  
developers to see how their work would comply with standards would  
also be great.

One thing I would find most usefull is a list of JEP recomendations  
promoted by the JSF for the implementation of the various generic/ 
obvious IM features that most XMPP clients have, even if the JEPs are  
considered experimental or even still in the inbox directory.

I know that we  can sort of get that information from the JEP headers  
and from the lists on <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/</A> but eecommendations  
change. A nice up-to-date global overview would be nice. The JEP  
database is huge and keeping track of the changes and trends without  
being very involved is hard.

Celso.

</I>&gt;<i> certification of open-source Jabber projects.  There are at least two

</I>&gt;<i> briefly:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Certification.  You would have several levels.  I'm proposing the
</I>&gt;<i> bare minimum would be 100% XMPP compliance.  Beyond that you would
</I>&gt;<i> have multiple levels, and some would be pertinent to clients, others
</I>&gt;<i> to servers, and perhaps still others would apply to tools, libraries,
</I>&gt;<i> and other categories.  An example is that you can get your XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> button, and if you like, go for a Silver ribbon which means you meet
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP, plus Basic and Intermediate IM Suite JEPs. (That's a totally
</I>&gt;<i> made up example, no real decisions have been made at this oint.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Official JSF Projects.  This proposal would entail the JSF voting
</I>&gt;<i> on naming multiple projects, as &quot;official&quot;.  It would be a badge of
</I>&gt;<i> honor.  It's assumed (by me anyway) that you would have to meet some
</I>&gt;<i> level of certification to become eligible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why am I telling you this?  Well Rachel tells us that she and Julian
</I>&gt;<i> tried to get certification going a while ago and it went down in
</I>&gt;<i> flames when brought up here on JDEV.  So, let it be known that round
</I>&gt;<i> #2 of certification is coming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on the outline I've given above (which again is just based on a
</I>&gt;<i> single day of discussion) would you just absolutely freak out if this
</I>&gt;<i> were to be implemented?  Or would you say &quot;about time!&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -1 / 0 / +1 ?
