<PRE>We're having quite a debate on the JSF Members list today. 
(<A HREF="https://www.jabber.org/members/">https://www.jabber.org/members/</A>) The main topic is
certification of open-source Jabber projects.  There are at least two
types of certifications being discussed, and I'll go over them very
briefly:

1) Certification.  You would have several levels.  I'm proposing the
bare minimum would be 100% XMPP compliance.  Beyond that you would
have multiple levels, and some would be pertinent to clients, others
to servers, and perhaps still others would apply to tools, libraries,
and other categories.  An example is that you can get your XMPP
button, and if you like, go for a Silver ribbon which means you meet
XMPP, plus Basic and Intermediate IM Suite JEPs. (That's a totally
made up example, no real decisions have been made at this oint.)

2) Official JSF Projects.  This proposal would entail the JSF voting
on naming multiple projects, as &quot;official&quot;.  It would be a badge of
honor.  It's assumed (by me anyway) that you would have to meet some
level of certification to become eligible.

Why am I telling you this?  Well Rachel tells us that she and Julian
tried to get certification going a while ago and it went down in
flames when brought up here on JDEV.  So, let it be known that round
#2 of certification is coming.

Based on the outline I've given above (which again is just based on a
single day of discussion) would you just absolutely freak out if this
were to be implemented?  Or would you say &quot;about time!&quot;?

-1 / 0 / +1 ?
