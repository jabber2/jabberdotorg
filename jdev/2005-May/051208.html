Well, I do not think that the functionality of the &quot;Supported JSF Projects&quot; 
should be &quot;helping end users to choose software&quot;. IMO a list with such 
functionality is something for websites like usejabber.com, jabberes.org,...

The functionality of the &quot;Supported JSF Projects&quot; list is:
* to give busineses, open source projects, governements,... that want to 
implement Jabber technologies, good reference software (where they eventually 
can build on);
* a promotional intrument for the projects that got on the list (e.g.: they 
can say (maybe with a logo), that they are on the list);
(*) the JSF can decide to only show high-quality compliant software in this 
list when it is doing conferences;
* other Jabber communities such as jabberes.org can base their list on the 
Supported JSF Projects list and make theirs more subjective (less clients, 
user interface characteristics, which languages it supports (a client list on 
jabberes.org shows for example which languages of Spain are supported),...).

So, in conclusion, I think a list that focusses on end users, is *not* 
intended to be the website of the JSF. Such a subjective list is the 
functionality for Jabber communities like usejabber.com, jabber.au, 
jabberes.org,...
