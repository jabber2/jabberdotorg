I fail to see what anyone is making up here. TLS is documented in
Section 5 of RFC 3920. Server dialback is documented in Section 8
of RFC 3920. Stream features are documented in Section 4.6 of RFC
3920. Nowhere in RFC 3920 is it set forth that two servers MUST 
NOT or SHOULD NOT complete dialback if they have completed TLS 
(although RFC 3920 does say that two servers SHOULD NOT complete
dialback if they have completed SASL). If you are suggesting that
rfc3920bis be changed to so specify the relationship between TLS
and dialback, that is one thing. But the spec as written does not
forbid this behavior in any way.
