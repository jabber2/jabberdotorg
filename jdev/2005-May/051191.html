You can't compare AIM, a company, with the JSF, an organisation promoting an 
open technology. To me it seems simple:

1) The JSF should promote the clients that support the Jabber/XMPP protocols 
the best. This can be more than one client, and this will be no fixed list.
2) A company providing Jabber services for example can do the same promoting 
strategy for its own Jabber client like AIM does.

&gt;<i> Besides, in a way Jabberd1 and 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabberd2 have the &quot;aura&quot; that they are the preferred servers,
</I>
Wasn't ejabberd the preferred server? ;-)

&gt;<i> but I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> think that really upsets the other server writers.  Granted, that's just
</I>&gt;<i> my opinion, I can't speak for anyone else.  =D
