<PRE>Hi dear developers,

IMHO will be allright have the list of the clients sorted by rank column.

Users will vote/rank the favorite client...probably is a fair method.

Kind regards,

Roberto

Oggetto: RE: [jdev] XMPP Certification Opinion Poll

To throw my hat in the ring...
I started using jabber about 10-12 months ago and did the whole &quot;what client
to use&quot; shuffle. I think I even have most of them still installed on one of
my home PCs. I don't know if this would trivialize things or not but how
hard could it me to have users ranking clients on 5 or so key factors (easy
of setup, etc)? And then allow users to sort but ranking, recent update,
alpha, etc.
I have to agree that the first time I looked at the clients I thought I was
going to be testing clients forever, but I was out to prove OSS IM is a
viable solution for a client. The server list is smaller but I don't know if
those feature scores have changed in the past year or not.
The ranking idea might work there as well.

Maybe Im barking up the wrong tree, maybe rankings are counterproductive to
the OSS concept, but I find in the software world it helps keep the
motivation in projects that are good and functional and the published and
forget fall by the way side. That's kind of why I was glad to see the house
keeping on jabberstudio when the site went down.

Anyway time to get of the soapbox....

Peter

Hi,

I think having a certification of libraries and servers makes a lot of
sense.

Doing it for clients I think will only take a lot of time and not worth the
effort. It's just not very interesting information for the user, but for a
user of a server (server admin) and libraries (application developers) it's
very interesting to see how the tools comply with the specifications.

I think that if we have some kind of review process for clients the only
thing it should do is to decide whether the client is listed on the
jabber.org web page or not.

Could also be a good idea to just list one preferred client for each OS
though this is bound to create discussions. If I come as a new user and go
to: <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.shtml">http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.shtml</A> I would most likely turn
around there and go fetch ICQ or something, that list is daunting, or you
can spend an entire weekend trying each of the clients for your operating
system.

Just my thoughts,
   Mikael Hallendal

&gt;<i> We're having quite a debate on the JSF Members list today.
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://www.jabber.org/members/">https://www.jabber.org/members/</A>) The main topic is 
</I>&gt;<i> certification of open-source Jabber projects.  There are at least two 
</I>&gt;<i> types of certifications being discussed, and I'll go over them very
</I>&gt;<i> briefly:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Certification.  You would have several levels.  I'm proposing the 
</I>&gt;<i> bare minimum would be 100% XMPP compliance.  Beyond that you would 
</I>&gt;<i> have multiple levels, and some would be pertinent to clients, others 
</I>&gt;<i> to servers, and perhaps still others would apply to tools, libraries, 
</I>&gt;<i> and other categories.  An example is that you can get your XMPP 
</I>&gt;<i> button, and if you like, go for a Silver ribbon which means you meet 
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP, plus Basic and Intermediate IM Suite JEPs. (That's a totally 
</I>&gt;<i> made up example, no real decisions have been made at this oint.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Official JSF Projects.  This proposal would entail the JSF voting 
</I>&gt;<i> on naming multiple projects, as &quot;official&quot;.  It would be a badge of 
</I>&gt;<i> honor.  It's assumed (by me anyway) that you would have to meet some 
</I>&gt;<i> level of certification to become eligible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why am I telling you this?  Well Rachel tells us that she and Julian 
</I>&gt;<i> tried to get certification going a while ago and it went down in 
</I>&gt;<i> flames when brought up here on JDEV.  So, let it be known that round
</I>&gt;<i> #2 of certification is coming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on the outline I've given above (which again is just based on a 
</I>&gt;<i> single day of discussion) would you just absolutely freak out if this 
</I>&gt;<i> were to be implemented?  Or would you say &quot;about time!&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -1 / 0 / +1 ?
