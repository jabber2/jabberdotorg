<PRE>   Hello, Remko!

RT&gt; It all depends on how you look at a nickname. For me, a nickname is a
RT&gt; static thing, which doesn't change (much), just as with the other
RT&gt; VCard fields such as addresses, phone numbers, e-mails, etc.

What about changing a place? I don't want to have two different jids for 
home &amp; work, also I like to move here &amp; there with my notebook.

RT&gt; Moreover, persons changing their nickname constantly (as people are
RT&gt; doing on MSN) is very confusing practice, as most of the time i fail
RT&gt; to find these persons in my roster when i need them.

It only means that your client doesn't support the contact renaming for the 
MSN protocol. It's possible in many clients except the standard ones :) It's 
not a hack, this feature is documented.

RT&gt; And in that case, i would just put that in my status message, as it
RT&gt; reflects my status.

Status message describes the status, not a location. I don't wanna change 
all status messages if I move from one location to another. Also I don't 
want to create the separate profile (settings &amp; history database) for every 
place.
