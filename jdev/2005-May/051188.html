</I>&gt;<i> It is true that users who hit jabber.org for the first time need

</I>&gt;<i> offering only one or two clients is unfair for the other developers.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore we have a long list with the box at the top of the page as a

</I>&gt;<i> large list of certified clients, servers, etc.

As a client developer, I must say that I wouldn't be insulted or find it
unfair if there was a &quot;chosen&quot; client (that was not mine).  =)  Take gaim
for example, lots of people live and breath by gaim, but if you go to
AIM's site you won't find it listed there.  Instead, you'll be pointed a
the official AIM client.  I know that's a somewhat different scenario, but
I did want to point out that I don't think it's unfair to pick a
particular client to be the &quot;preferred&quot; client.  I don't think it's going
to stop anyone from writing their own.  =D  Besides, in a way Jabberd1 and
Jabberd2 have the &quot;aura&quot; that they are the preferred servers, but I don't
think that really upsets the other server writers.  Granted, that's just
my opinion, I can't speak for anyone else.  =D

Daniel
