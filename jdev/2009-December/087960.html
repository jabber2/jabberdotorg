The case I've been thinking about in relation to XEP-0189 (and things
that might be built on top of it) is end-to-end encryption by web
clients. We had some hallway discussion about that at IETF 74. Until and
unless someone writes a TLS and X.509 stack in JavaScript, web clients
will be out of luck. Something simpler might be preferable. But that's a
bigger topic and might belong on another mailing list. :)

&gt;<i> Plus, that gains you the ability to tap into sometmes quite advanced

</I>
As someone who uses a client certificate, I agree that's a good thing.
Naturally, you could sign your RSA key with your X.509 cert or OpenPGP
key or other such material. But, again, that might be a topic for
another time and place...
