</I>For a start you should really have you server very well secured. Very
restriced access to anything, not letting mysql server or whatever to be
accessed by anything else than localhost. No root ssh login, only
certificate login, and so on and so on... So I think keeping anyone from
even near the database seems a better solution for now.
Also, since many users use easy passwords cracking hashes is not a huge
problem. I remember some projects which were focused on pre-cracking
hashes, but this goes back to when I used IRC so I dont remember that
well what it was about. I think they were collecting windows password
hashes and cracking them so if they found another hash that is the same
they would already have the password. With distributed computer systems
this does not take a long time and it would be easy to get any jabber
password. So really, focus on not giving the database away, however that
can happen.
A more secure way is keeping the database encrypted as a whole, which
would mean server administrators have to decrypt the database on server
startup which again is very bad on server crashes and so on... Again,
while its de-crypted someone could access the plain database.

Securing a server in general seems like a very sane idea IMHO
