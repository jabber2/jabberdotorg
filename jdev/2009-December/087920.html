There's server support, too.

In particular, the history upload functionality described in Section  
7.6 is needed, and we don't do this.

The problem is that as currently specified, there's no indication  
that the history was uploaded by (to use Ex 53) crone1, and it  
appears to have been genuinely uttered in the room by wiccarocks.

In these example, that's exactly what happened, of course - but what  
if the user is presented with an apparent conversation between two  
people, ending in &quot;Sure, invite Jonas into the conversation, but I  
have to go&quot;. How are you supposed to know if the person really was  
there at all?

We could address this in various ways - like an additional, or  
perhaps different, &lt;delay&gt; element, or some other server-inserted  
indicator. But this really does need sorting out before I'm terribly  
happy writing in the code.

Dave.
