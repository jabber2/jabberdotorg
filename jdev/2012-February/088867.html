<PRE>Hi,

I am new to XMPP and have a few questions.  I have read the book and a number of different websites and am still not sure about a few things.

We are considering using XMPP for chat, conferencing, etc between a number of systems that will not be connected via a reliable network.  The systems may lose connectivity at any time, especially if one is moving.  Since any of the systems can lose connectivity, an XMPP server will run at each one so the systems that are still connected can communicate.

I am using Openfire and Spark as well as a bot I created using the gloox c++ library to do some prototyping/testing.


-          Is a DNS required to use XMPP, in particular for the server to server connections?  I have played around with using the hosts file and I can't seem to get that to work.

-          I have seen references to BOSH for unreliable connections but it usually referred to client-server connections.  Could that be used for server-server connections as well or is there something else you would recommend?

-          Is multicast required?

-          I understand that conferences are hosted at a particular server.  That would mean if that particular server lost connectivity then the conference would be unavailable for the others that are still connected.  Is there any way around this?

Thanks in advance!
Rob
