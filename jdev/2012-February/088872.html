<PRE>Thanks for the replies!!

I wanted to respond to the questions:

Yes and no, nodes can lose connectivity but the IPs will not change

&gt;<i>4. Reliable chat and conferencing between nodes (as reliable as the

correct

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is that correct? Is a central server completely out of the question?
</I>
Yes, a central server is out of the question because there is no one system that will always be accessible by the other systems.

I have another question.  If I have two Spark clients, each connected to their own Openfire servers, and I break the network connection between the two servers, there is no indication on either client that they are no longer connected.  If I type a text message in one client, it behaves the same as if the servers were still connected and gives no indication of an error.  Is this the norm for XMPP clients?

Thanks again,
Rob
