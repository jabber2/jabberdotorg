<PRE>This is very interesting to me also.

On a related note, we just got a new DELL server with RAID and 4 NIC
back-panel with Advanced Server 2000...this is supposed to really expand the
number of sockets and simultaneous requests (the 4NIC connector).

I've been concerned about Jabber being server dependent all along, instead
of allowing clients to talk amongst themselves -- I understand the
philosophy behind this -- no need for updates...but I totally
disagree....I've seen this before and software always needs to be
updated...and so you spend your time trying to make a server system with
transports and no software upgrades, but you end up doing it anyway...I
still don't understand about this because for anyone trying to make a
successful/popular site...your whole goal is lots of users and if it doesn't
scale well....well, what's the use then?

No flames please...I'm not trying to make anything negative here....just
looking to know how to scale Jabber like the gentlemen asked above.

Any comments?

Subject: [JDEV] scaling a single server?


&gt;<i> I've got a customer with 25 lakh users.  In case you're not familiar
</I>&gt;<i> with the units they use in India (I wasn't), 1 lakh == 10,000.  They
</I>&gt;<i> also comma-ize in an original and inventive manner, so they have
</I>&gt;<i> 2,50,000 users.  I'm trying to convince them NOT to implement a
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary system.  This should not be impossible since they have
</I>&gt;<i> developed a predilection to Open Source solutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They want to add all 25 lakh users to Jabber all at once, and announce
</I>&gt;<i> it.  Clearly there is not going to be a ramp-up period to give them
</I>&gt;<i> time to gain experience with Jabber.  They need to know that it will
</I>&gt;<i> scale from the get-go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously this is OS dependent.  My customer is running Redhat 6.1 on
</I>&gt;<i> a machine with 18GB of hard drive and 1GB of memory.  Those values
</I>&gt;<i> should not be the constraint.  I'm more concerned with the number of
</I>&gt;<i> sockets that can be open at any one time.  If Linux has a limit of
</I>&gt;<i> 1,000 sockets, and they have (they estimate) 25 thousand users online
</I>&gt;<i> at any one time, that means they need 25 servers.  This is double-plus
</I>&gt;<i> ungood.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any experience with how big a single Jabber server
</I>&gt;<i> can scale?
