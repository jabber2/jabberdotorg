The Webmin stuff is pretty cool, but I didn't see anything that would come
close to touching Director and its &quot;Save as Java&quot; command.  Granted, I
didn't see JFlash.  All I could find was JShock.  Did I miss something?
Oh, and since the Shockwave player is now a system DLL, you can run SW
movies as apps just as easily as you can play them in a browser.  And
they're no bigger.

Admittedly, the Macromedia solutions only cover Mac and Windows.  I'm not
suggesting ditching the Java project, as it is better for wide-platform
deployment.  This is just another solution that offers higher-quality
clients in a more restricted market.  It's a tradeoff.
