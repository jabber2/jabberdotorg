<PRE>Quoting Keith Minkler &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">keith at digix.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; My goal has been to support client-to-client with the server being more
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory.
</I>&gt;<i> Robert, This is not the goal of jabber at all.  We use a 'smart' server
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> knows how to communicate with all sorts of different services so that the
</I>&gt;<i> 'dumb' clients only have to know how to talk to the server.  The method you
</I>&gt;<i> are proposing, having client/client communication only, would put the ball
</I>&gt;<i> in the clients court so to speak when it comes to talking to all the
</I>&gt;<i> different IM clients.. that means that your client would have to know how
</I>&gt;<i> to talk to ICQ, AIM, MSN, et all.. which is just dumb IMO.
</I>
  I'm not getting your point here at all.  Granted, I'm not for client&lt;-&gt;client 
myself, but there is nothing stopping a client from implementing it in the 
protocol for a reason.  As long as it is allowed to use either or, with a 
preference on direct client&lt;-&gt;client, it should be fine, and even better with 
feature negotiations.

&gt;<i> &gt; I just don't see myself implementing Jabber for communities where the
</I>&gt;<i> goal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; his high growth.
</I>&gt;<i> *HUH*?  Jabber is scalable to the point of world domination... it uses
</I>&gt;<i> distrubuted servers.. ever hear of e-mail?
</I>
  Yes, we all have, but I think the primary concern here is one location with 
500,000 users.  Right now, the only solution would be to divy up the users 
between servers, using different addresses, aka, jabber1.isp.com, 
jabber2.isp.com.

  Now, EVENTUALLY, probrably in the realm of 1.x+, since 1.0 will be out soon, 
servers will have the ability to run one domain accross multiple servers, aka, 
many machines could serve up jabber.isp.com, using a DNS round robin type of 
scheme, so don't give up hope there..

  Also, UDP capabilities I feel will eventually make their way in there, simply 
do to popular demand..  This will also bump up the number of users capable of 
being hosted on one server..
