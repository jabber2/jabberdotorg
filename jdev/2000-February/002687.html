<PRE>hi, I'm a MUDder too :P
I was trying to make a MUD transport (IMC based (messaging, not playing)), but
stuck on somewhere... I was thinking jabber IDs of mud charachters such as
jabber:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">mud_serv_name at mud-network-name.jabber.org</A>/character_name , but I got
stuck somewhere in IMC. The problem is, there's no STANDART way to learn the
connected charachters to a MUD using the IMC2 protocol... I mean, you can ask
the MUD the users connected to it, but it doesn't return the names in a
standart form, but in a way, that only a human can read (IMC is designed for
MUDs, and telnet connections, the asking MUD simply sends the text it got in
reply to the local user, who had asked for those users on the remote MUD).

For example, some MUDs return a text such as:
&quot;Janny the young adventurer
Rithiren the spell wielder of Sune&quot;

and some MUDs return such as:
&quot;-= tHiS iS LoSt ReAlMs mUd =-
List of users:
Janny the young adventurer
Rithiren the spell wielder of Sune
-==========================-&quot;

and, so, I couldn't decide how to handle this.... If anyone (MUDder or not)
has some ideas on how we can implement this, please tell!

&lt;note&gt;
There's some way I think to handle this, but a bad way... The jabber user
(registered to the mud-transport) will send a message to the jabber-transport
for example, and the Jabber transport will return a message, that the string
&quot;Please use the names below in a pattern such as
'jabber:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">mud_name at mud-network-name.jabber.org</A>/&lt;insert name here&gt;'&quot; and the text
returned from the remote MUD appended together...
&lt;/note&gt;

thanks,

If it happens once, it's a bug.
If it happens twice, it's a feature.
If it happens more than twice, it's a design philosophy.
