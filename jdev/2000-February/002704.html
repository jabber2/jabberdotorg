<PRE>Everyone,

I guess it's about time that jer or I interject here.  This thread is getting
huge and we'll become misleading to people looking at jabber.  Jer and I have
talked about scaling into the realm of millions of users, and for some reason
I'm finding myself disappointed by how everyone is viewing this problem.
Everyone seems to think that out of any single box we can run millions of
users.  This is just not possible, and completely unpractical.  Think of all
the XML you would be parsing.  Your CPU would decide to kill you.  So, after
jer and I talked about this, we came to the conclusion that this is really a
solution that has to be evaluated per setup that people need.  We examined
one case and have come up with a very very sweet setup for these people, it
doesn't not involve a single machine, rather a good amount of them.  We'll
see how they like it, and once it's implemented it will set a standard for
how these setups work in the future.  Think big people.  Think infrastructure
think domination.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Yes, we all have, but I think the primary concern here is one location with 
</I>&gt;<i> 500,000 users.  Right now, the only solution would be to divy up the users 
</I>&gt;<i> between servers, using different addresses, aka, jabber1.isp.com, 
</I>&gt;<i> jabber2.isp.com.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Now, EVENTUALLY, probrably in the realm of 1.x+, since 1.0 will be out soon, 
</I>&gt;<i> servers will have the ability to run one domain accross multiple servers, aka, 
</I>&gt;<i> many machines could serve up jabber.isp.com, using a DNS round robin type of 
</I>&gt;<i> scheme, so don't give up hope there..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Also, UDP capabilities I feel will eventually make their way in there, simply
