<PRE>Perhaps a better model for your requirements would be this:
1) Modify your email and news servers so that they are Jabber
clients. This is an extremely simple task, as there are numerous
libraries in existence that do most of the work for you.
2) When a new message arrives, your servers simply send a
notification message to the appropriate user or users via the Jabber
server, in the same way that any client would send a message to any
other. 

This design has several advantages:
It is far easier to implement than the design you have suggested.
It is more efficient, in that it is push based instead of polling.
The users receive new message notification immediately instead of
   after polling delay.


&gt;<i>    * Currently, my Jabber client can send information about non
</I>&gt;<i>      availability and some message like &quot;i am away for lunch&quot; . But now
</I>&gt;<i>      i want my client  to send information regarding the time duration
</I>&gt;<i>      of non availability, so this time for non-availabitly should be
</I>&gt;<i>      stored on server , and jabber server intern send a message about
</I>&gt;<i>      the availability after the stated time duration is over.
</I>
You can embed arbitrary information in your &lt;presence/&gt; presence tags
via the &lt;x/&gt; tag. You can also put any such information in textual form
into the &lt;status/&gt; subtag of &lt;presence/&gt;

Those data will be available to anybody who gets your presence
information.

</I>&gt;<i> I am currently working on Internet based project where we have

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Following are some requirements where we can think of using Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    * Email System - We need to have the some client application which
</I>&gt;<i>      indicates the arrival of new mails on the email server(This email
</I>&gt;<i>      server is developed by us). To achieve this functionality we are
</I>&gt;<i>      planning to use Jabber. The application(jabber) client will be
</I>&gt;<i>      polling to the Jabber server after some predefined time interval,
</I>&gt;<i>      intern Jabber server will be polling to our email server after
</I>&gt;<i>      predefined time(user set).
</I>&gt;<i>    * News Server - We are going to have our News server which will be
</I>&gt;<i>      displaying news to the clients after some predifined time interval.
</I>&gt;<i>      We want that the Jabber server to poll our news server after
</I>&gt;<i>      predefined time(User set)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As we have read though the documentation we need to write the Transport
</I>&gt;<i> for Email and News server and using DSO or Socket we can talk between
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber and Email and News server  and  we will have Etherx(a middleware
</I>&gt;<i> between Transport and Jabber Server) .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I assume above understanding about the Jabber and Transport , Etherx is
</I>&gt;<i> correct, I will appreciate if you can provide us following information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    * Detail documents about writing the Transport and Etherx.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Any guidelines, alternative suggestion to achieve above said
</I>&gt;<i>      requirements.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Details about the Module and Service API(The links are broken from
</I>&gt;<i>      page <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/general/architecture/">http://docs.jabber.org/general/architecture/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
