But remember that users must have at least IE 4.0 to have this file, and (if
Macromedia puts the same terms as they used to for Flash) you may not
redistribute the player. If you want to manually include it with an
application install, you have to pay a per-product royalty fee.

Well I'm still looking, generator does nothing for you since it is
server-generated flash - it doesn't generate flash based on user input on
their remote systems. JFlash sounds cool, it is also a product I was going
to write a long, long time ago and sell (along with JPDF) :)
