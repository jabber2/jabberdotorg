<PRE>I am a C programmer and will find out how I can help.  I have a
new Wintel machine and have yet to upgrade to Linux and I do not
own any commercial C compiler besides BC5 (and I lost that a year
ago) and I am strarting to believe that C++ only complicates the
matter anyway and that free C compilers are far more standardized
platforms and that there is nothing that can be done in C++ that
can't be done in C.  I have yet to install Linux, but that will
come in a month or so.  In the mean time, I have been enjoying
the freedom of using only two types, (&quot;void *&quot; and &quot;int&quot;) and
casting the cast system into my pile of never seen again
warnings.  My point is that I intend to make sure that there is a
client (and server maybe) version of Jabber that will compile
with mingw32, cygwin32, and lcc32.  The reason for my writing,
however, is an idea that I haven't seen mentioned yet.  MUDs are
chatting systems as well.  If MUDders wanted to participate, they
should have an oportunity to associate a handle on another system
with there name(s) on MUD(s).  Also, I am working on the Smaug
code base.  It occurred to me that a modern Wintel system with a
big hard drive and (I have 128Mb.) substantial memory could
easily host a MUD with a large number of clients over a
relatively slow (I use have a 28K baud (due to my location).)
connection.  A system such as Jabber could theoretically link
these MUDs with similar code bases and widely varying areas
allowing people to create and share their own realms and play as
God(esse)s there while being able to experience new areas and
logon to these other when they are online.  Enough said.  I will
send more when it is available, but first I must return to
reading all of this stuff.  My apologies if I spoke too soon (as
I usually do).  Any suggestions for me as to how I could broaden
my own scope or help with Jabber or other projects would be
greatly appreciated.
