<PRE>Daniel,

Thanks for your reply and info. Will certainly try this.

At the same time, we have a design need where the client specifies the
frequency and periodicity when it wants information from the respective
application servers e.g. check mail, news etc. server/s every x minutes. The
purpose is to reduce interruption to the user from immediate versus periodic
notification. That is why we thought Jabber would poll the relevant servers.

Secondly, we do not wish to send the full message content (e.g. mails, news,
documents etc.) but only notifications of their availability. Therefore at the
Jabber client end, a user would click on the links to the contents (which
would appear as pop-up's) and download them directly from the respective
servers (bypassing Jabber server and client) to open in the respective client
applications.

The second part of your answer did not describe how to set the time (duration)
of unavailability at the server (e.g. to temporarily suspend the operations
above because user is online but unavailable as in DND). Is it that the client
notifies and sets the setting on the server to online?

It will help us to understand the power and flexibility of Jabber (as well as
where we may extend its functionality because of the application and project
we are working on) if we had the following info:
        * Detailed documents about writing Transports and Etherx.
        * Details about the Module and Service API's (The links from
<A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/general/architecture/">http://docs.jabber.org/general/architecture/</A>
are broken.

Your help is appreciated ASAP. Thanks.

Sarang.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Currently, my Jabber client can send information about non

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      the availability after the stated time duration is over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can embed arbitrary information in your &lt;presence/&gt; presence tags

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dear Jabber Developers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am currently working on Internet based project where we have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requirment for  Instant messaging service, we have identified the Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the IM server,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Following are some requirements where we can think of using Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Email System - We need to have the some client application which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      indicates the arrival of new mails on the email server(This email
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      server is developed by us). To achieve this functionality we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      planning to use Jabber. The application(jabber) client will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      polling to the Jabber server after some predefined time interval,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      intern Jabber server will be polling to our email server after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      predefined time(user set).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * News Server - We are going to have our News server which will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      displaying news to the clients after some predifined time interval.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      We want that the Jabber server to poll our news server after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      predefined time(User set)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As we have read though the documentation we need to write the Transport
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for Email and News server and using DSO or Socket we can talk between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber and Email and News server  and  we will have Etherx(a middleware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between Transport and Jabber Server) .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I assume above understanding about the Jabber and Transport , Etherx is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct, I will appreciate if you can provide us following information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Detail documents about writing the Transport and Etherx.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Any guidelines, alternative suggestion to achieve above said
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Details about the Module and Service API(The links are broken from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      page <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/general/architecture/">http://docs.jabber.org/general/architecture/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
