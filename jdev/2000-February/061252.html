<PRE>Dear Jabber Developers,

I am currently working on Internet based project where we have
requirment for  Instant messaging service, we have identified the Jabber
as the IM server,

Following are some requirements where we can think of using Jabber

   * Email System - We need to have the some client application which
     indicates the arrival of new mails on the email server(This email
     server is developed by us). To achieve this functionality we are
     planning to use Jabber. The application(jabber) client will be
     polling to the Jabber server after some predefined time interval,
     intern Jabber server will be polling to our email server after
     predefined time(user set).
   * News Server - We are going to have our News server which will be
     displaying news to the clients after some predifined time interval.
     We want that the Jabber server to poll our news server after
     predefined time(User set)

As we have read though the documentation we need to write the Transport
for Email and News server and using DSO or Socket we can talk between
Jabber and Email and News server  and  we will have Etherx(a middleware
between Transport and Jabber Server) .

I assume above understanding about the Jabber and Transport , Etherx is
correct, I will appreciate if you can provide us following information.

   * Detail documents about writing the Transport and Etherx.
   * Any guidelines, alternative suggestion to achieve above said
     requirements.
   * Details about the Module and Service API(The links are broken from
     page <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/general/architecture/">http://docs.jabber.org/general/architecture/</A>)
   * Currently, my Jabber client can send information about non
     availability and some message like &quot;i am away for lunch&quot; . But now
     i want my client  to send information regarding the time duration
     of non availability, so this time for non-availabitly should be
     stored on server , and jabber server intern send a message about
     the availability after the stated time duration is over.

Thanks


Sarang ....
