<PRE><A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/dists/0.9/">http://download.jabber.org/dists/0.9/</A>

It's also installed and running at jabber.org (the 0.8 accounts were not
transferred over, reg new ones).

============
=== Summary of changes from 0.8:

The protocol hasn't changed in any major ways, the only two noticeable
changes have been that iq results are empty (use the id attribute to track
them) and the format of the error elements uses a standard numerical code
similar to http.

The code moved around in the libraries quite a bit.  libjabber is now a
general &quot;Jabber Utility&quot; library for servers and clients.  libetherx now
handles all of the pth thread and server streaming utilities.

The actual server, jserver, has been rewritten with new flexible APIs.
Much of the server code itself is now in modules, similar to Apache.
Documents are being written on how to hook into the various APIs, but if
you are not afraid of the source you can get a head start now.

============
=== New (beta) features and bug fixes:

There are various places that network-level rate limits are being applied,
restricting some DoS and flood attacks, more will be implemented before
0.9 final including protocol rate limits to restrict spam and other such
improper uses.

Agents and registration are now included to assist bridging clients and
transports or any other back-end software.  Numerous presence and roster
related bugs have been corrected, as well as lots of other smaller fixes
and feature additions.

============
=== Needs!  There are a few easy things we could use help with:

==&gt; Build Niceness: easy install scripts, cross-platform testing, packages
(deb, rpm, etc)

==&gt; Telnet Service: providing a full jabber client with just telnet,
started in jabber-transport as svc_telnet.c

==&gt; IRC Service: allowing any IRC client to talk directly to a Jabber
server, started in jabber-transport as svc_irc*.c

==&gt; Clients: assist with the ongoing development of clients for Gnome,
KDE, Mac, Java, Console, and other platforms.

============
=== Feedback:

If you can help, want to get involved, or want to report any problems with
the build/install, join most of the core team on irc.openprojects.net in
#jabber or send email to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">info at jabber.org.</A>

============
=== Plans:

We're working on a 0.9pre3 release which will include preliminary SSL
streams and undergo stress testing for performance, memory, and high
loads.  Following a pre3, there will be one or two more pre-releases
before the final 0.9.  Our plan is to re-release 0.9-final as 1.0 after a
few weeks allowing us to work out any last bugs and let the client and
transport development catch up.

============
=== Clients:

Currently WinJab and Jabba are known to work well with 0.9, both are
available at <A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/.">http://download.jabber.org/.</A>  You can also use telnet (port
5228, still somewhat limited) and any IRC client (just /server host) which
is in testing but works fairly well.


Thanks,

Jer
