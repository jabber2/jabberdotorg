<PRE>On Tue, Feb 08, 2000 at 12:12:49PM -0500, Brian Gray mentioned:
&gt;<i> Hey folks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My name's Brian, I just signed on a few minutes ago and thought I'd
</I>&gt;<i> introduce myself.  I'm a programmer/analyst in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, working
</I>&gt;<i> at a sports-based web company.  For a little while now I've been leading a
</I>&gt;<i> team to create a distributed communications system to handle chat,
</I>&gt;<i> persistent message boards, web-based email, and other sundry
</I>&gt;<i> community-building tasks.  It's a big job, and it's planned to consume a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of engineering resources.
</I>
 Before you get too busy, take a quick look at www.arsdigita.com. We are
doing a similar thing - big community site, based almost 100% on free
software[0], and found their &quot;ACS&quot;, or the ArsDigita Community System to
be an excellent base for our efforts.

 ACS is very big, it's very scattered, and it's obvious it's never been
re-written, but together with AOLServer, it's an excellent basis for the
web part of a community system. Hopefully after we get everything
finished, we can try &amp; release all our modifications to all the free
software, so setting up a &quot;Community&quot; would be a lot easier for other
people.

 I think David Waite is still working on a Java applet Jabber client, and
though it's not as likely to be flash (sic) as a shockwave one, it's
probably a good deal more portable (and awkward people like me disable
shockwave for no good reason).

Kate

[0] Horde/IMP, Qmail, AOLServer, TCL, Apache, PHP, are the free parts,
with Oracle, SpinChat and Intershop there because equivilant free software
wasn't good enough yet.
