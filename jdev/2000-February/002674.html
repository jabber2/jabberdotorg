<PRE>I can't give you any idea about scalability of Jabber, but I do know that
the number of sockets a process can have open is tunable in the kernel.  I
don't know for Linux (as opposed to the commercial Unices I've used) whether
that is a socket specific parameter or just a factor of NFILE.  I imagine
that with that many users tho., a fair few parameters might need to be
changed.

One of the things I've seen software do to scale better (to thousands of
concurrent users) is to use the UDP protocol -- and maintain the idea of a
connection at an application layer.  This doesn't provide for the simplest
coding, but given that your average user may not act to cause any traffic
very often at all, it provides the least load on the server machine (in
terms of kernel/network resources anyway).

It seems to me that a system of tiering connections through to a server
would provide the most scalability.  Can etherx run on a different machine
from the Jabber server?

Subject: [JDEV] scaling a single server?


&gt;<i>I've got a customer with 25 lakh users.  In case you're not familiar
</I>&gt;<i>with the units they use in India (I wasn't), 1 lakh == 10,000.  They
</I>&gt;<i>also comma-ize in an original and inventive manner, so they have
</I>&gt;<i>2,50,000 users.  I'm trying to convince them NOT to implement a
</I>&gt;<i>proprietary system.  This should not be impossible since they have
</I>&gt;<i>developed a predilection to Open Source solutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>They want to add all 25 lakh users to Jabber all at once, and announce
</I>&gt;<i>it.  Clearly there is not going to be a ramp-up period to give them
</I>&gt;<i>time to gain experience with Jabber.  They need to know that it will
</I>&gt;<i>scale from the get-go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Obviously this is OS dependent.  My customer is running Redhat 6.1 on
</I>&gt;<i>a machine with 18GB of hard drive and 1GB of memory.  Those values
</I>&gt;<i>should not be the constraint.  I'm more concerned with the number of
</I>&gt;<i>sockets that can be open at any one time.  If Linux has a limit of
</I>&gt;<i>1,000 sockets, and they have (they estimate) 25 thousand users online
</I>&gt;<i>at any one time, that means they need 25 servers.  This is double-plus
</I>&gt;<i>ungood.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Does anyone have any experience with how big a single Jabber server
</I>&gt;<i>can scale?
