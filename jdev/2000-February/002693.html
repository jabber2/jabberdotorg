The usual way of dealing with situations like this is to define parsers for
each type of MUD, or even each individual MUD, and have a single server
which gateways to that MUD and groks its way of sending data.

Of course, if you could get all the mud admins to agree on a standard
output format (XML the world!) then you would be happy, but from my
experience in that area, good luck!
