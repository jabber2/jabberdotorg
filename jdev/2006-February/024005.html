For sure. The reason we put this stuff in a registry is so that we have
clear documentation of what the most common fields are (if you want to
use more specialized fields, you're on your own). We hope that because
we've defined the fields, client developers can create localized text
strings for them rather than using the English labels in the JEPs. In
fact, perhaps it would be helpful simply to remove the labels entirely
from the examples. At the very least, each JEP that describes or uses a
FORM_TYPE probably needs to include an Internationalization
Considerations section that talks about localization of the form fields.
