That's not the opinion people here had about Google only allowing plaintext 
authentication.  They said that what a server chooses to expose to the world 
is the server's choice, and it doesn't make it non-compliant.

(If you want to start that argument up again, you can take it up with the 
people who originally had the opposite opinion because really, I just care 
about getting things to work.)

&gt;<i> &gt;   2) a server might not claim to be XMPP compliant at all, and still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support the feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may be missing something else, therefore it would not be compliant for

You must have misread what I wrote.  Try reading it again, with emphasis added 
around the important part.

        A server ** might not claim to be XMPP compliant at all **
                                     ...and still support the feature.

For example, if jabberd1.4 went and implemented privacy lists, then it would 
still have privacy lists as a feature, without being XMPP compliant or even 
claiming to be.  In this scenario, I don't want to penalise the server 
because it supports the feature I need it to support.

In other words, assuming that only compliant servers support privacy lists is 
just as incorrect as assuming that privacy lists are only supported on 
compliant servers.

&gt;<i> Then you would have to provide a way to test if the server allows sending
</I>&gt;<i> stanzas and everything. The protocol would get incredibly complicated if
</I>&gt;<i> you tested just any feature. In every protocol, there is some base that can
</I>&gt;<i> not be tested, protocol states it is supported by anything, so why to test
</I>&gt;<i> it? Would it make logical sense to say it is supported by any server and
</I>&gt;<i> then allow client to test if it is?
</I>
No, but this isn't a feature supported by every server, is it?

Even assuming this _were_ a feature which were supported by all XMPP compliant 
servers, there is actually no disco#info feature which can tell me that a 
server is XMPP compliant in the first place.
