<PRE>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

In version 1.17 of JEP-0045 (2004-10-04), the FORM_TYPEs for room
configuration and for user registration requests were modified. This
change was introduced late in the standards process and may not have
been advisable (that's the same day the XMPP RFCs were published,
perhaps I was distracted). I'd like to take a poll of those who have
implemented JEP-0045 (either in a server or in a client). The question
is, which of the following would you prefer:

1. Retain the change made in 1.17, which specifies the following:

   room config: <A HREF="http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#roomconfig">http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#roomconfig</A>
   registration requests: <A HREF="http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#register">http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#register</A>

2. Revert to the old FORM_TYPEs:

   room config: <A HREF="http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#owner">http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#owner</A>
   registration requests: <A HREF="http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user">http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user</A>

Feel free to reply on or off list and I will tabulate the results.

Peter

I agree that this change was probably unforutunate but I don't remember
why we made it -- perhaps there was a concern about confusion regarding
muc#user and muc#owner but I don't recall.

At this point it seems best to retain the change (MUC service
implementations could look for both the old and the new FORM_TYPEs, be
liberal in what you accept and all that) but I'm not wedded to that.
Perhaps it make sense to poll implementors to see what their preference
is (e.g., I doubt that mu-conference has been brought up to date).
