<PRE>Hello folks,

now that there is some fresh air regarding implementions of SASL
Anonymous I decided to officially announce a new project I started some
months ago.

MUCkl is a web-based application for groupchats which aims to be very
easy to use (supply a nick and hit the button...). It's being derived
from JWChat thus it's based on JSJaC, which has been enhanced to support
SASL Anonymous (well at least it works with a patch that's available for
ejabberd and that is said to be included with the next official
release). 

If you want to take a look please direct your Firefox or MSIE *shiver*
to <A HREF="http://jwchat.org/MUCkl/">http://jwchat.org/MUCkl/</A> and have fun. A tarball containing all
required sources is available at
<A HREF="http://zeank.in-berlin.de/download/MUCkl-0.4.1.tar.gz">http://zeank.in-berlin.de/download/MUCkl-0.4.1.tar.gz</A>

Of course one of the reason I'm writing here is because I'm looking for
people interested in contributing to this project. As you might have
noticed there's no (official) project page yet, there are no docs (well,
a small README) and of course there could be much more code (I've got a
lot of ideas for this app...). So if you really like this piece of
software and the ideas behind it maybe you could find some time to help
out or join forces? Let me know!

In any case, your feedback is very welcome!

Cheers, Steve
