No, that's not quite the point. With a polling mechanisms that allows
you to send whenever you want (which allows you too poll as frequently
as you like or doesn't limit polling for non empty requests) you could
have just this.

It's more that you're able to receive (from a client's perspective) data
immediately at any time as there's always at least one request pending
and thus available for sending data to the client. 
In this situation if it wouldn't be allowed to do simultaneous requests,
in order to send data a client would have to wait  until a pending
request returns either from running into a timeout or because data is
being transmitted to the client.

Cheers, Steve
