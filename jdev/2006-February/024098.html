Mark your calendars!

The Jabber Software Foundation (JSF) will hold an XMPP interoperability
testing event on July 24 and 25, 2006, at the Open Source Development
Lab (OSDL) in Portland, Oregon, USA. This is the same week as O'Reilly's
Open Source Convention (OSCON).

The purpose of this event is to test interoperability between multiple
implementations of the XMPP RFCs (3920 and 3921). All participants will
be expected to file implementation reports (in accordance with a format
and template yet to be developed), which will form one input to the
process of advancing the XMPP specifications from Proposed Standard to
Draft Standard within the Internet Standards Process at the IETF (see
RFC 2026). The other expected outcome will be a consensus set of
proposed modifications and clarifications to the XMPP RFCs for
discussion on the mailing list of the XMPP WG after the event concludes
(see <A HREF="http://www.xmpp.org/xmppbis.html">http://www.xmpp.org/xmppbis.html</A> for provisional examples).

The main focus of this event will be server testing. Testing of clients
that are in or near full compliance with the XMPP RFCs will also occur
(XMPP is a client-server technology, so we need both), but given the
large number of Jabber/XMPP clients it will not be feasible to test very
many clients. A set of test cases will be published several months in
advance for use by the participants. The test cases will focus only on
protocol compliance, not scalability, reliability, ease of use, or other
such factors.

This will be a small, developer-only event. No customers, no marketing
people, no guano. All bugs will stay in the room.

The JSF will charge a small, nominal fee for participation (yet to be
determined) in order to cover costs associated with OSDL's hosting of
the event. This fee will be waived for open-source developers.

Space is limited because of the venue (a conference room at OSDL).
Therefore it is possible that we will need to restrict access (e.g.,
impose a limit of one representative per company or project). Ideally
this would not be necessary, but we're doing the best we can.

This is not a more general developer conference. While the JSF may hold
such conferences in the future, this is a small, focused, interop
testing event. However, participants are encouraged to attend OSCON
(same week, same city) and to get involved in Jabber-related activities
there.

If you are interested in participating in this event, please contact me
directly via IM, email, or phone (not on this list) using the addresses
listed here:

Finally, I would like to thank OSDL for generously offering to host this
event. Thanks also to the existing sponsors of the JSF for making events
such as this possible.

Peter
