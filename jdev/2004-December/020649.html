<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Urm as far as I read it the starter of this topic wants to have a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific functionaility of being able to express voip-presence, not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply the capability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Capability is disco.. wether it's enabled or not you can express perfectly 
</I>&gt;<i> with 115. Exactly as in the orginal proposal of the author. Without 
</I>&gt;<i> pubsub.
</I>
??? Not sure I understand what you are talking about here, are you saying 
voip-presence can be done using JEP-115 cleanly and inline with the spirit 
of it?

&gt;<i> He nowhere stated that do-not-disturb could not be expressed using normal 
</I>&gt;<i> presence (since this is bundled with the URI in his orginal proposal). In 
</I>&gt;<i> fact, he later said something like &quot;away for VoIP does not always mean 
</I>&gt;<i> away for IM, but away for IM always means away for VoIP&quot;. In his original 
</I>&gt;<i> proposal this already worked.
</I>
Urm yes he did, infact he specifically said that the voip-presence cannot be 
guessed from your IM presence, thus the need to have the voip-presence 
separately specified using pubsub, I quote:

&quot;No: when I'm DnD for IM, then certainly I'm DnD for VoIP (also known as
&quot;away&quot;). But when I'm in a voip call, I'm certainly still able to read
IM messages: this is a presence information, and it can't be guessed
from the IM presence.&quot;

&gt;<i> You jumped ahead with demanding pubsub and  disco and who knows what, 
</I>&gt;<i> which I'm glad you dropped now.
</I>
I havent dropped it you have obviously just misunderstood what I have said 
throughout, I have and always said pubsub was for solving the voip-presence 
(Task 3) problem which is still the only way I can see it being solved 
cleanly.
