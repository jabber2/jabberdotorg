As I stated, I'm aware of all these reasons. However, they do not just  
apply to entity capabilities. According to the JEP version 0.1 dates to  
2003-08-27. Version 0.1 of PubSub dates to 2002-11-19 (somewhere after  
Jabberconf Europe I believe). Many protocols that are currently in  
&quot;waiting for PubSub&quot; mode, and many of those date from way before 115 of  
even PubSub itself!

As I said, you won't find *me* telling you 115 is a bad idea. I'm just  
intrested in the reasons behind this decision and the rather quick  
acceptance of 115 to Draft, despite only having heard so far the same  
arguments for it that apply to so many other problems.

That for me raises a few more questions, that you'll perhaps find more  
intresting or challenging to answer.

Is it the intention to ever &quot;move&quot; 115 to pubsub or are there other  
arguments why it should stay the same way it is now other than &quot;backwards  
compatible&quot;?

If there are any such arguments, do they only apply to 115 and not other  
protocols, if so then why?

Since the intention of 115 is to prevent many disco requests being send,  
what about all those protocols that are currently stuck in &quot;waiting for  
Disco&quot; mode. Will 115 be enough to meet their needs? If so, do they  
already take 115 into account? If not, what should be done with disco?  
(Perhaps in relation to 115)

With hindsight, I think we could have benifited from a generic way to use  
presence in an optimized way, that would be easy to migrate PubSub if  
needed. Too late for that now.. or is it?
