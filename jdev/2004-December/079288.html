It seems that way to me, too.

Supposing you chat with people for one minute each day (in reality it tends to 
be much longer unless it's just a memo), and you have 1,000 people you 
actually chat to on your roster.

That takes 1,000 minutes of chatting, or 16-17 hours.  If you did that during 
a week (seems reasonable) then you'd only be doing 3 days of real work out of 
every 5 days in the office. :-)

What would be much more sane would be adding everyone to all the contacts in 
the same team, and then adding every boss to their subordinate.  That's more 
of a realistic communication path already.
