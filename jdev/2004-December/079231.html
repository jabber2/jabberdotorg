<PRE>Le jeudi 02 d&#233;cembre 2004 &#224; 09:58 +0000, Richard Dobson a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> &gt; JEP-066, example 6?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes well JEP-0066 is simply showing a web url that someone can execute if 
</I>&gt;<i> they want to, in the same way as when you execute url's in any other 
</I>&gt;<i> application of jabber:x:oob, but you seem to be trying to use it to express 
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that you are in a call, that is against it, you shouldnt be using 
</I>&gt;<i> jabber:x:oob for anything really other than sending the user a uri to 
</I>&gt;<i> execute, you are trying to use it to express something it is not designed 
</I>&gt;<i> for and inso doing will likely break clients that currently handle 
</I>&gt;<i> jabber:x:oob as the spec says it should, also example 6 seems to really be 
</I>&gt;<i> showing is a way for someone to look up more information from that user 
</I>&gt;<i> while they are offline, it says nothing about using jabber:x:oob in online 
</I>&gt;<i> presence stanzas.
</I>
Hmmmm... I'm sending an uri that people can use to call me if they want
to (and my voip client will ask me to accept). I'm not expressing that
I'm in a call but that I'm available at that uri for a call. 

&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I did test my patch, and it does work...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did you test it when its sending it to every different client to make sure 
</I>&gt;<i> it works? Or did you just test it against your patched gaim?
</I>&gt;<i> If you did do a proper test to make sure it doesnt cause problems with any 
</I>&gt;<i> other client then thats good, but if you havent you cant really say you have 
</I>&gt;<i> tested it and it works.
</I>
I tried it with:
* patched gaim ;
* unpatched gaim ;
* gossip.

My patched gaim didn't seem to give any headache to either of the
innocent clients...

&gt;<i> &gt; JEP-066 doesn't call what I do 'wrong', it says 'creative usage' ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> JEP-0066 does not say anything about what you are trying to do with it im 
</I>&gt;<i> afraid.
</I>
JEP-0066, paragraph 3 (jabber:x:oob):
&quot;However, the 'jabber:x:oob' namespace is useful for communicating a URL
to other users or applications. This is done by including an &lt;x/&gt; child
element qualified by the 'jabber:x:oob' namespace in either a &lt;message/&gt;
and &lt;presence/&gt; stanza; the &lt;x/&gt; child MUST contain a &lt;url/&gt; child
specifying the URL of the resource, and MAY contain an optional &lt;desc/&gt;
child describing the resource.&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; Arg. Point taken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good good, we dont want to make all those poor windows users with the 
</I>&gt;<i> default security setup that havent updated in ages even more as risk do we 
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>
Notice that I fail to see the huge security gain between:
1) exporting the voip uri right away ;
2) exporting the voip feature, and giving the corresponding uri on
request.

&gt;<i> &gt; Step 3 can wait.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good good, then I suggest you just follow the first two tasks I outlined 
</I>&gt;<i> using those existing standard protocols as they are intended to be used, if 
</I>&gt;<i> you do that you will be fine.
</I>
I don't see very well what should go one way and the other ; could you
write a mockup (like I did to show what the patch I have does)?

&gt;<i> 2) initiate a chat with another voip capable client (this should be done
</I>&gt;<i> using JEP-0020, then JEP-0066).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next you use JEP-0020 to negotiate which voip protocol to use to talk to 
</I>&gt;<i> another user, i.e. sip/h323/iax, etc then once the two clients have used 
</I>&gt;<i> JEP-0020 to decide which protocol to use JEP-0066 in jabber:iq:oob to send 
</I>&gt;<i> the voip uri that the other user needs to use to connect.
</I>
Why do I always have the impression that you think having the voip uri
gives anything to anyone? You know, a typical voip uri is much like a
jabber uri: it tells you to which server you have to ask for whom ; for
example: &quot;h323:ils.seconix.com/<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">that.user at you.know</A>&quot; . That doesn't
generally give you an ip, but just a mean to find it out.

Once you have a voip-uri:
* your client must ask the server for your ip (and the server can
refuse!) ;
* your client must connect to your voip-client (and you may refuse!).

&gt;<i> There we have it voip support done all using the existing standard protocols 
</I>&gt;<i> as they are supposed to be used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Back to the chalkboard :-/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yup but as I say, just follow those protocols for tasks 1 and 2 and you wont 
</I>&gt;<i> need to create any new protocols, just use what is already there and in the 
</I>&gt;<i> correct way. If you need any further help on implementing or understanding 
</I>&gt;<i> those protocols and how they fit together just ask as I have experience 
</I>&gt;<i> implementing those and know how they work.
</I>
Yes, a mockup client-client discussion would be nice.

Thanks,

JP
