<PRE>Ehhh,

I'am sorry but it was not my intention to restrict you in any way.
Hello again,

The code I send can be used by anyone for anything without any
restrictions!!!

I understood from the whole discussion about flash that the jabber
mantainers 
didn't want to include the flash patch from 1.4 into 2.0 because its not
very nice etc etc.

Because I needed the patch for our project I made it anyhow.
Now, for anyone who can use it I wanted to give it to them so they don't
Have to start all over.

What I wanted to say with this line:
&gt;<i> You don't have to embed it into your code but its just for anyone who 
</I>&gt;<i> can use it.
</I>Just means that I don't expect the jabberd2.0 mantainers to embed it into a
new release. But if they want to, be my guest 

Hope my intentions are clearer now

Grt

Marcel

By sending yout patch with this notice you have broken (IMHO) the jabberd
license (GPL) by restricting our rights to your modification of jabberd
code.

Please do not use such thing on public mailing list, especially when posting
patches.
