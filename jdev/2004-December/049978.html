<PRE>Le lundi 06 d&#233;cembre 2004 &#224; 09:11 +0000, Richard Dobson a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Well before we had JEP-0115 clients that supported disco and wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> find out what other clients supported would send the disco request to any
</I>&gt;<i> people as they become available (i.e. receive an available presence stanza
</I>&gt;<i> from them), but this was a bit bandwidth intensive and could cause a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> a flood of requests when a user logged on, so JEP-0115 was developed so that
</I>&gt;<i> you could help avoid this flood of requests everytime because it would tell
</I>&gt;<i> other clients in that first presence stanza they receive from you what your
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities are so they dont need to necessarily flood you with disco
</I>&gt;<i> requests as you have already told them what you support and can just use 
</I>&gt;<i> their cache of the disco requests that link with the caps that you 
</I>&gt;<i> published, this avoids them rerequesting disco infos everytime you log in.
</I>
Notice the above is one single sentence. Let me try to restate it
differently to see if my poor brain's parser did a decent job with it:

Before JEP-0115 was written, a connecting client would send a simple
presence message. That message would trigger the sending of disco
requests from all of its contacts, requests that it would have to handle
itself.

Now that JEP-0115 is there, a connecting client sends a more complex
presence message, where it states its capabilities. And even when the
contacts need more information on some piece, the server has a cache
that enables it to handle the load more easily.

That means that to make a client able to do voip, I would have to modify
it to:
* send voip capability declarations in presence ;
* handle disco requests about the voip (say callto and h323 are
supported, for example) ;
* recognize oob voip uris and trigger a voip call (receive the h323
adress of the im-caller -- which it sends because it knows I can do
that) ;
* recognize the voip capability declarations in others' presence.

Do I get it at least partially correct?
