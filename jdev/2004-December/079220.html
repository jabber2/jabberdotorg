So you don't need to update it each time it changes. Now remember that.


&gt;&gt;<i> If you want to receive SIP calls  enable it, if you don't disable it.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or as JEP-115 puts it &quot;Some clients  will have bundles of functionality  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that can be enabled and disabled.&quot;  Doesn't sound very against the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I would concider against the spirit of it would be to try to use it  
</I>&gt;<i> to publish the voip-uri or your voip presence, rather than as you point  
</I>&gt;<i> out use it to advertise the capability.
</I>
That's what you made of it. Noone (including the starter of this topic)  
ever made that a requirment.

&gt;&gt;<i> Once you want to intitiate your SIP conversation you retrieve the URI.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The mechanism for this, well that will depend on your requirments. You  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could define a simple IQ request for an x:oob packet (this should  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appeal to you if you think security is important, since you could send  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an error if you don't want to share).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good thats exactly the sort of thing I would want it to be.
</I>
Then why do you insist on PubSub? You see what I'm getting at here?

&gt;&gt;<i> What's the case for pubsub anyway? It's not dynamic..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Urm yes it is dynamic, i.e. when you update it it is resent to the  
</I>&gt;<i> people who want to know about it.
</I>
Pubsub is dynamic (duh). It's our data that's not. Thus there is no need  
for PubSub.

&gt;&gt;<i> in fact, I don't  even *want* the uri to be updated, *unless* I put in  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a call.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As pointed out above you wouldnt even want it to be a uri, you would  
</I>&gt;<i> want it to be something more generic to represent the voip presence i.e.  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;incall&quot; or &quot;notincall&quot;.
</I>
Well, the topic starter had no such goals with his proposal. He listed a  
&quot;VoIP presence&quot; as a potential extention. Maybe one day there will be such  
a thing (using pubsub no doubt) it's not at all important for what we want  
to accomplish. The only &quot;presence&quot; that matters is &quot;enabled&quot; or &quot;not  
enables&quot;, 115 can do this without pubsub. This makes a lot more sense for  
what the topic starter wants to accomplish (it can work today, for  
example).


&gt;&gt;<i> Ofcourse, this could mean we'll end up in the larger discussion.. is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JEP-0115 a good idea or just a presence hack to fix the flaws of Disco  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like iChat and avatars? Why doesn't this use pubsub other than the well  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know reasons &quot;there's no good pubsub server out there, no client  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supports it etc.&quot; for example?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No this isnt what I was trying to point out at all,
</I>
That's cause it's what I am pointing out. And apologies to Ralpm ;) who  
has written a very good pubsub server, as well as hosting one for all of  
us to experiment on.
