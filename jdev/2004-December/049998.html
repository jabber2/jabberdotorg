<PRE>Richard,

I am not sure that its a company policy or rational behavior issue.

I have seen users that can not login to a precreated account when there password is something as simple as &quot;Dog&quot;.  There are some amazing folks out there.  People that add everyone on the server to their rosters, that add the company phonebook to their cellphones, etc...just in case they should every need it...so some such rationale.

Just like in the O'Really book &quot;Dealing with Users&quot;. ;)

Jonathan 

Ps.  Thanks for the pointer to JEP-0038.  I have a lot of reading to do!

&gt;<i> A real-world application is a client at the end of a dialup link with
</I>&gt;<i> a company wide roster.  I don&#8217;t have a solution to this.  I have added
</I>&gt;<i> it to a list of things to &quot;be aware of&quot;  and &quot;wonder/think about&quot; when
</I>&gt;<i> the chance arises.

Not sure its really a real world situation to have a company wide roster, 
you will only in a real world situation likely have the collegues you 
communicate with the most on your roster, the rest whom you might want to 
communicate with rarely you will likely add them to your roster as and when 
(using a search capability in the client that searches a company wide 
employee db), or just send messages to them without adding them to your 
roster at all. I find it very hard to believe that companies will opt for 
company wide rosters certainly not if the number of employees is over 50 or 
so, and even then I doubt many would opt for company wide rosters as the 
roster just becomes unusable over a certain level, and if people only 
communicate with certain other people very infrequently or never whats the 
point in having them in your roster in the first place??.

Richard
