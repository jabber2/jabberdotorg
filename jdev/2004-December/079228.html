<PRE>Le mercredi 01 d&#233;cembre 2004 &#224; 15:34 +0000, Richard Dobson a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> &gt; Notice that voip-presence and im-presence are not entirely unrelated:
</I>&gt;<i> No but its unrelated enough to not be correct as an extension to IM 
</I>&gt;<i> presence, as I and others have repeatedly said.
</I>
:<i>-/
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; I really think that:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * using presence isn't as stupid as you think ;
</I>&gt;<i> Its not just me that thinks it, and as you are new to jabber I would suggest 
</I>&gt;<i> you listen to the people that have been working with it and developing with 
</I>&gt;<i> it for a very long time (I myself have been working with jabber stuff since 
</I>&gt;<i> before there was even a JSF).
</I>
You must understand that people tend to be very very careful when said
&quot;You really, really need to first design a protocol!&quot; by a
protocol-geek...

&gt;<i> &gt; * using jabber:x:oob to send the uri isn't against the standard ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No using jabber:x:oob is the correct thing to send the URI in, but you are 
</I>&gt;<i> using jabber:x:oob in a way that is wrong and will potensially cause serious 
</I>&gt;<i> problems with backwards compatibility, sending a voip-uri in jabber:x:oob is 
</I>&gt;<i> asking the recieving client to execute that URI and pass it right to the 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate application on the users system, which will likely cause them to 
</I>&gt;<i> start a voip call, trying to use this as a way to say you are in a voip call 
</I>&gt;<i> is simply wrong and against the spec.
</I>
JEP-066, example 6?

&gt;<i> &gt; * it works _now_, and not in 10 years when people will have finished
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debatting the issue ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It wont work now due to the problems outlined above.
</I>
Well, I did test my patch, and it does work...

&gt;<i> &gt; * it makes a very simple patch that has a chance to get upstream now ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It might be simple but it is still wrong.
</I>
JEP-066 doesn't call what I do 'wrong', it says 'creative usage' ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Bad. You assume that deciding if the call is done or not is jabber's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem: it's not. There's a voip-client there: it will ask the user for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confirmation. When someone has your voip-uri, you still have your word
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to say.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Besides, aren't the presence packets only sent to contacts for which I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already said they were authorized to know about me?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not always no, if for example you are in a chatroom the people in that room 
</I>&gt;<i> will get your presence, and if you are adding your extension to presence 
</I>&gt;<i> lots of people will know what your machines IP etc is, which is very bad, 
</I>&gt;<i> jabber is designed in such a way that normally your IP address will not be 
</I>&gt;<i> revealed to all and sundry, also when chatting to people you and adding them 
</I>&gt;<i> to your contacts it doesnt mean you necessarily trust them enough to reveal 
</I>&gt;<i> your ip address uncessarily, what about DDos attacks or the various buffer 
</I>&gt;<i> overflow attacks that can be performed against a users machine once someone 
</I>&gt;<i> has their IP? The VoIP software you speak of will do nothing to protect the 
</I>&gt;<i> user from that.
</I>
Arg. Point taken.

&gt;<i> &gt; Hmmm... as far as I remember, I had to allow my contacts to see me, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they had to decide they wanted to see me... so telling them &quot;I'm there&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't polluting the network, it's using it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But you are not just telling them you are there (thats what the standard IM 
</I>&gt;<i> presence already does on its own), you are telling them extra information on 
</I>&gt;<i> top of that which most will not want or need to know, thus the pollution, 
</I>&gt;<i> its far better if only clients that want to receive said extra information 
</I>&gt;<i> receive it, thus the need to use pubsub.
</I>
Hmmm... but if I tell them I have voip, and their client allows them to
get my voip-uri on demand... what's the difference?

&gt;<i> Rushing through things just because you are impatient is never a good idea, 
</I>&gt;<i> start working with us rather than fighting us and you will find this will go 
</I>&gt;<i> much faster.
</I>
Well, you'll notice that I wrote to ask, so I'm not that bad.

&gt;<i> There are several separate tasks you seem to be trying to bunch together 
</I>&gt;<i> here and in doing so you are not doing it the right way, the different tasks 
</I>&gt;<i> I can see are as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) advertise a client is voip capable (this should be done using JEP-0030 
</I>&gt;<i> and JEP-0115).
</I>&gt;<i> 2) initiate a chat with another voip capable client (this should be done 
</I>&gt;<i> using JEP-0020, then JEP-0066).
</I>&gt;<i> 3) advertise your voip-presence as something separate from the normal 
</I>&gt;<i> im-presence (there is nothing currently to do this, but as has been said a 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol based on pubsub is the best solution to this task).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So overall you can do most of what you are trying to do now and right away 
</I>&gt;<i> without having to wait for anything, it is only task 3 that needs a protocol 
</I>&gt;<i> developed for it, and IMO step 3 is the least needed part of this and isnt 
</I>&gt;<i> really even needed to get voip calling working in jabber clients, if I were 
</I>&gt;<i> you I would just forget about task 3 for the moment and leave that for 
</I>&gt;<i> sometime in the future, it really is not needed as you can use the 
</I>&gt;<i> im-presence to notify other people you are on the phone (IMO you should be 
</I>&gt;<i> just doing it this way anyway).
</I>
Step 3 can wait.

&gt;<i> Well if your &quot;simple&quot; patch is not following the standards I dont see them 
</I>&gt;<i> even accepting that, if all you really want to do is allow people to call 
</I>&gt;<i> each other using their im clients then you just need to implement Tasks 1 
</I>&gt;<i> and 2 outlined above and just forget about Task 3 (which IMO is not needed 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway).
</I>
Since the beginning of the thread, I modified the patch to send&amp;accept
&lt;x xmlns='jabber:x:oob'&gt;
&lt;url&gt;h323:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">me at there</A>&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;desc&gt;VoIP&lt;/desc&gt;
&lt;/x&gt;
in presence, and according to JEP-066, it follows the standard ; but
your objections are a concern :-/

Back to the chalkboard :-/
