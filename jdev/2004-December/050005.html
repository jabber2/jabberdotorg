Maybe the Jabber.ru site has more power users as Jabber.org is probably 
used by many user for testing.

&gt;<i> Also please checkout <A HREF="http://status.jabber.org.">http://status.jabber.org.</A> You can see that normal

</I>
I am not worried by bandwidth but much more by the load on generated on 
the server to route a big number of presence packets simultaneously. You 
are probably right that the behaviour of the server can optimize this to 
an acceptable level. For now the benchmark I did were quite impacted by 
the number of contact in users rosters.
I will investigate more on this and keep you informed of my findings.

&gt;<i> Honestly, I think we're worrying about a non-issue. As someone else
</I>&gt;<i> brought up, a server could also use JEP-131 to allow remote servers to
</I>&gt;<i> do the de-multiplexing of presence packets.
</I>
I did not see this aspect of JEP-0131, so I will look into it.
