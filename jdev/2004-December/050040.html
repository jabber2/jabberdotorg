Hallo Marcel..

Jacek was refering to the wonderfull disclaimer LogicaCMG adds to all your  
emails:

&gt;<i> This e-mail and any attachment is for authorised use by the intended  
</I>&gt;<i> recipient(s) only. It may contain proprietary material, confidential  
</I>&gt;<i> information and/or be subject to legal privilege. It should not be  
</I>&gt;<i> copied, disclosed to, retained or used by, any other party. If you are  
</I>&gt;<i> not an intended recipient then please promptly delete this e-mail and  
</I>&gt;<i> any attachment and all copies and inform the sender. Thank you.

As you can see it says that only people on this list can use your patch.  
We also are not allowed to copy the patch into a file, Which is.. well, a  
bit of a problem when you want to apply it. Furthermore we're not allowed  
to retain it (which makes you wonder why they don't add an X-No-Archive  
header, doh). It's nice of you to say we can use it, but who do we trust  
(well, fear) more, you or the (Logica)CMG legal department?

Ok, so I doubt many people will take that serious, technically Jacek is  
correct of course. Well actually, I don't agree you've broken the GPL  
license (the small bits of GPL code inside the patch fall under the dutch  
equivelant of Fair Use, before they're covered by the GPL), it just means  
your patch can not be distributed with any GPL products which would be a  
shame.

Ok, so it's a bit whining you may think now. Well I agree with Jacek it is  
a bit annoying to see those things on public mailinglists (dare I say,  
even more than people telling me to get a hotmail account all the time),  
and.. stranger things have happend at CMG. (Then again maybe you're an  
ex-Logica employee? ;)

More on topic:
Anyone intrested in Jabber(+this patch) (if you dare use it ;) and Flash  
(as one poster in the topic was) should check out XIFF:
