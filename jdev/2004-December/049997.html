Not sure its really a real world situation to have a company wide roster, 
you will only in a real world situation likely have the collegues you 
communicate with the most on your roster, the rest whom you might want to 
communicate with rarely you will likely add them to your roster as and when 
(using a search capability in the client that searches a company wide 
employee db), or just send messages to them without adding them to your 
roster at all. I find it very hard to believe that companies will opt for 
company wide rosters certainly not if the number of employees is over 50 or 
so, and even then I doubt many would opt for company wide rosters as the 
roster just becomes unusable over a certain level, and if people only 
communicate with certain other people very infrequently or never whats the 
point in having them in your roster in the first place??.
