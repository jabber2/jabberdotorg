</I>
The big advantages are:
* spammers will end up in jail more easily as it is easier to locate them.
* providers that allow spammers to use their services will get a bad 
reputation (as spammers can't use the domains of the competition of their 
provider)
* virusses can't use the address from a third party in the Outlook address 
book for the From: header (so social engineering will be a bit more 
difficult).
* emails will be more valued in court.
