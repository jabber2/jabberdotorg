I had seen that before sending the announcement. My first read of this 
draft let me think that the idea was to publish Webdav event through pubsub.
My idea is more to use different access protocol to the pubsub 
mechanism. Let me emphasize the difference. I think Webdav is the most 
consistent, but probably FTP could be a valid protocol to publish 
information inside the bus.
If the file is big, you do not have to publish it completly: You can 
only publish metadata on the bus, along with a link to the given file.

The initial need is the following: A J-EAI project is aiming at 
exchanging official document over a pubsub J-EAI channel. The document 
are stored and timestamped by a bus client and delivered to several 
others. However, the file can become quite big and we do not want to 
limit the size of the document. Embedding them in the XMPP stream is 
thus not very wise. That's why I looked for another way to publish data 
on pubsub nodes.

I think anyway, that this previous work is a very good basis to push the 
idea of Webdav and pubsub integration further.

&gt;<i> But this would be neat.  There was someone on a mailing list recently
</I>&gt;<i> who asked how he could restrict file transfers in his company.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> had a client which only supported a method like this, you could write
</I>&gt;<i> policy around it which could be very benefiical for a corporate
</I>&gt;<i> environment.
</I>
Yes. And being able to tie users on the Webdav server with the one of 
the XMPP/Pubsub server also opens interesting opportunities.
