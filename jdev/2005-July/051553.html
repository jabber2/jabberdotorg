<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;         
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Use pubsub: A method of specifying the location of the pubsub
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         node would still be required, and then additional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         access-restrictions would need to be implemented on the pubsub
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         node itself.  In particular the access-restrictions would need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         to be updated to match the changing membership of the room.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well-known node locations are possible and disco items is there for
</I>&gt;<i> discovering it too.
</I>
Is there a JEP on this?  My understanding is that node-paths are opaque
and need to be publicised via other methods. 

&gt;<i> For the access restrictions, a particular
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of muc could publish the node automatically and
</I>&gt;<i> updating access restrictions every time a user is registered or
</I>&gt;<i> unregistered (or join/leave the room). Being on the same host and if
</I>&gt;<i> the whitelist of subscribers is not persistent, there should be not
</I>&gt;<i> much of an overhead for this updating.
</I>
It still requires active synchronisation of two sets of data (MUC
members and the pubsub access-list).  So you need a bot or a MUC
implementation that contains a pubsub client implementation.   And you
still need some method of publishing the node location (although
disco-extensions would be acceptable in this case).

If you're looking for a method of creating interactive applications I've
been thinking about methods of doing this, but I don't this is it (I've
also made some comments about this on the standards-jig list).

Cheers,
Steve
