</I>Drupal and Flexinode can do the job, for sure. But personally i think 
jabberstudio is a great piece of software, worth improvement and not 
replacement.
The major improvement points i see are documentation and browsability / 
usability. I personally think js.o is quite complete regarding 
functionality, but that's a personal view and i am not a guy that tends 
towards function overloading - i like things simple and slick and not 
too complex - form follows function.

As i read in the mails, the core js.o team has no time to maintain the 
site or do major feature enhancements - which is fine, j.o owes a lot of 
respect to this huge contribution. But j.o seriously needs some power 
and maybe a proper process how to handle improvement requests and work 
on site. Thanks to Peter, most website work gets done - but of course 
peter can't do everything and i think that's not his job.

I propose some sort of &quot;Job openings&quot; or &quot;Get involved&quot; page / site 
especially for jabber.org related projects, or at least some listing on 
the &quot;Contribute&quot; section of J.o. I'd prefer a dedicated job listing page 
for all sort of jabber related projects, companys or groups, be it 
commercial or open source. Do some members have thoughts on this ?
