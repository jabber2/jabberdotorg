Actually it's xmpp: but whatever. ;-)

I have no idea -- you'd have to do some usability testing.

</I>
I refuse to speculate as the intelligence of the average AOL user.

&gt;<i> Are there any findings on how often mislead emails (= non-spam)

Not that I know of.

&gt;<i> The JID vs EMail topic has sure already been discussed to death on
</I>&gt;<i> this list, 
</I>
Since Jabber was started in 1999, I've never seen anyone worry about it 
until you posted to the list. It is possible that there was some 
discussion about it in the very early days (August 1999 or so). See for 
instance this thread:
