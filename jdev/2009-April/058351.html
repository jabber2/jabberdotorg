<PRE>Norman Rasmussen a &#233;crit :
&gt;&gt;<i> Our fixes are and will be free software, you&#8217;ll be able to take them back if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want. However, I have the intention to change quite a lot of things: revamp
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simplexmp, replace debug with standard logging, get rid of fake inheritance,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc. Are these ground-breaking changes suitable for incorporation in xmpppy?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> as far as I'm concerned:
</I>&gt;<i>  - simplexml is ugly and should be thrown away.  something like the
</I>&gt;<i> standard python xml.dom and xml.sax (maybe xml.dom.pulldom) would be
</I>&gt;<i> more than enough
</I>I don't think that removing simplexml would be a good thing. simplexml is simple
(Captain Obvious agrees), and having a simple API to make Python objets from an
XML stream (thanks to expat) and serialize them back (thanks to __str__) seems
useful to me. I prefer cleaning simplexml than using DOM. I think we don&#8217;t need
such a complicated interface to handle stanzas.

&gt;<i>  - not sure what you mean about the fake inheritance - do you mean the
</I>&gt;<i> plugging?
</I>Yes, the plugin system and the horror[1] in client.py (CommonClient is derivated
in Client and Component, but its contructor does different things according to
the one call it (Client.__init__ or Component.__init__)). And other stuff like
this one.

[1] <A HREF="http://trac.last-exile.org/xmppony/browser/trunk/xmppony/client.py?rev=30#L119">http://trac.last-exile.org/xmppony/browser/trunk/xmppony/client.py?rev=30#L119</A>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Much of the code of xmpp.py was written by Alexey _before_ python had
</I>&gt;<i> support for all this stuff in it's internal libraries.  I've had to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with being able to run the transports on Python 2.2.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> Alexey did a fantastic job with what he had to work with when he wrote
</I>&gt;<i> the library.  Unfortunately (as it happens to all of us), he was
</I>&gt;<i> unable to dedicate as much time as he would have wanted to maintaining
</I>&gt;<i> the library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>As I already said to steve-e, I thank him for his job and I don't blame him: he
has his life.

&gt;<i> Moving forwards I would like to see:
</I>&gt;<i>  - true asynchronous code - Gajim team did this about a year ago.
</I>&gt;<i> They added non-blocking calls for almost everything that used to
</I>&gt;<i> block.  Support for asyncore would be great, because this is another
</I>&gt;<i> python built-in library.
</I>I don't understand why people do not like threads :'(
threading is a standard Python module too.

&gt;<i>  - cleaner separation of concerns - the Gajim team have started on
</I>&gt;<i> this.  The client should not care if the server connection is TCP or
</I>&gt;<i> TLS or SSL or BOSH or Magic-transport-method-5.
</I>That sounds good.

I want Magic-transport-method-5 \o/

&gt;<i>  - the library should continue to support client and transport
</I>&gt;<i> connections.  adhoc commands should get client-side (consumer) support
</I>&gt;<i> (currently only server-side (producer) is supported).
</I>Adhoc commands, pep, and other cool stuff are on my roadmap for v0.3.


&gt;<i>  - file transfer would be fantastic, would you support all 5 methods?
</I>&gt;<i> (si, ibb, oob, socks5, jingle)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>For now, xmppony supports si, socks5 and ibb. With emacs-jabber, I can already
send and receive files from a bot based on xmppony.
Jingle support would be great, but I didn't plan to touch it now (except if
someone sends me a patch).


As I said in previous mail, for v0.2, I plan to revamp simplexml, replace debug
with standard logging and get rid of fake inheritance. But I also take a look to
rfcs and xeps. Because they evolved since the code was written. For example, I
found 2 problems in omega's patch (which was written 4-5 years ago). I also plan
to make some unit tests.

The base must be cleanest possible before going further!
