<PRE>Stephan Erb a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Gajim has forked xmpppy as well. I guess the main difference is a switch
</I>&gt;<i> to non-blocking sockets and the implementation of BOSH.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there is a chance here to streamline all those different efforts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> steve-e
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Gajim uses non-blocking sockets to not have to use threads. I do not think only 
it is necessary to neglect the use of threads just to not have to be bored with, 
especially at the hour of the processors multi-cores.

Moreover as Yann said, the fork of Gajim does not really have anything any more 
to do with the xmpppy origin. So to reinstate my work in the fork of Gajim is 
impossible (of as much more than I do not intend to pass by non-blocking sockets).

Of elsewhere, it seems that the fork of Gajim is integrated now too much into 
Gajim, as if that had always done only one with Gajim.

So, that would involve large change in Gajim to set out again on the use of a 
third library.

To finish, I would say that I really intend to go in another direction that is 
currently taken by xmpppy. Although this release seems to bring nothing more 
than some corrections of bugs, a better respect of the pep8, and the file 
transfer, it is necessary to keep with the spirit that it is there to 
officialize the project.

As I said to Norman Rasmussen, I do not have any problem against the fact that 
it reinstates my modifications in xmpppy. But very sincerely I doubt that all my 
modifications are reinstated in xmpppy.

And although Alexey very recently recovered above, what says to us that he will 
have time to leave the 0.5 and to continue thereafter? Who says to us that there 
will not be another 2 year hole in the development of xmpppy?

I do not seek to blame him. He has his life. And I thank him for the work which 
he already carried out until now. Only for the reasons already evoked, I felt 
the need to fork xmpppy.

Future will tell whether my project is a mere waste of time or whether it really 
has its place. While keeping in mind that I have nothing against a future 
bringing together of the two projects, here and now I prefer coding and going ahead.
