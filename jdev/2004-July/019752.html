I didn't seem to have that problem when I got it working.  Are you sure you're 
talking about the configured proxy server, and not the _browser's_ configured 
proxy server?  I was using the amessage polling code and it worked pretty 
well at the time... except the inefficiency of polling is horrendous so I had 
to give it up.  Unfortunately though, we still have users connecting through 
the polling server so we can't shut it down without screwing someone over.

Actually, I didn't even make the connection when I posted between being behind 
a firewall and using an HTTP proxy.  I'm behind a firewall at home, and have 
been behind one for my last three jobs, but all of these places used 
transparent proxies.  I actually had to intentionally screw with my settings 
to simulate the unusual case of a manually-configured HTTP proxy, back when I 
tested that polling feature. :-)

&gt;<i> I guess the best choise to make Jabber available without installing a

</I>&gt;<i> client.
</I>
... or just to use a polling client like Psi, instead of an applet.  This is a 
far better choice as it doesn't die when you close the web browser, and works 
much more reliably in general. :-)
