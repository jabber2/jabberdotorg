My experience with open-source projects is that they are strongest where 
people are encouraged to entrust copyrights to a central body.  Of 
course, this means that people must trust that the body will not abuse 
their possession of the copyrights.

I think it is a really positive thing that people now *want* to assign 
their rights to the JSF.  This means it has become an organisation which 
is well-regarded and trusted by the Jabber community.

</I>
Personally, I'm a strong advocate of &quot;dual-licensing&quot; arrangements, such 
as that followed by mozilla.org (eg. Mozilla is provided under the 
MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license).  I think these provide a good balance between 
encouraging commercial innovation, and ensuring code is returned to the 
OSS community.

A JOSL/GPL dual-license for JSF-managed code would give people the 
maximum flexibility to decide how they want their development work 
treated by the community.  From this point of view, I think JOSL 1.1 
would be a welcome advance.
