<PRE>Hi there!

&gt;<i> &gt; My question is, how do federating servers scale to handle large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; amounts of traffic? Would the architecture scale any better than
</I>if he
&gt;<i> &gt; had simply connected as <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">app at jabber.ian.net</A>?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I get the feeling I may be looking at this the wrong way. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested in listening to anyone who knows more about XMPP and
</I>has
&gt;<i> &gt; ideas about how to approach this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest no doing it like this, as far as I can see you would
</I>be far
&gt;<i> better of using pubsub for whiteboarding like this as others have
</I>already
&gt;<i> been discussing, either on JDEV or Standards-JIG, have a look in the
</I>mail
&gt;<i> list history.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it's my understanding that pubsub
is designed for publish-subscribe, observer-style services? There are
definitely places within Gradient that could benefit from using a
pubsub implementation - specifically, at the moment the server
broadcasts to loaded documents using presence stanzas, which are hard
on the Jabber server and waste bandwidth.

However, the initial document loading isn't really pubsub-ish at the
moment, but more equivalent to an HTTP-like request/response model,
albeit one superimposed on a decidedly non-HTTP-like network. Are you
suggesting that I publish SVG documents as items to a node on a Jabber
server?

    Ian
