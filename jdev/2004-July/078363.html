<PRE>&gt;<i> I don't yet have a concrete solution to this, but my first reaction
</I>&gt;<i> was to move the 'server' JID to within the XMPP server - i.e. the
</I>&gt;<i> sever would have a JID of more similar to a MUC room, such as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;demo.example.org/gradient&quot;. My thinking was to federate an
</I>&gt;<i> 'application' XMPP server that would host these JIDS with an
</I>&gt;<i> 'authentication' XMPP server to which users sign on, manage rosters
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, suppose I set up ian.net with Jabberd2. Users can sign
</I>&gt;<i> on, chat with other users, etc. When Bob has an app that he wants to
</I>&gt;<i> make available to the general public, he federates bob.net with
</I>&gt;<i> ian.net, and thereafter (assuming I understand what federation is) GET
</I>&gt;<i> IQs sent from users on ian.net to a JID such as &quot;app.jabber.bob.net&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> are routed via the federation between the two servers on port 5269.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question is, how do federating servers scale to handle large
</I>&gt;<i> amounts of traffic? Would the architecture scale any better than if he
</I>&gt;<i> had simply connected as <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">app at jabber.ian.net</A>?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I get the feeling I may be looking at this the wrong way. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> interested in listening to anyone who knows more about XMPP and has
</I>&gt;<i> ideas about how to approach this.
</I>
I would suggest no doing it like this, as far as I can see you would be far
better of using pubsub for whiteboarding like this as others have already
been discussing, either on JDEV or Standards-JIG, have a look in the mail
list history.
