Not by me. Perhaps I need to upgrade my English parser.

Does the FSF indemnify all the code entrusted to it?

?

&gt;<i> IMO, the JSF should not become a source code escrow manager.
</I>
Why not? I'm not pushing for that, but I'm curious about your reasoning.

&gt;&gt;<i>2. Code licensing / terms of use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Just make the license be OSI approved. Done, end of story.

Naturally.

&gt;&gt;<i>I really meant to raise issue #1. Is there a legitimate role for the JSF

</I>
It's not so much a question of ownership as of stewardship. People entrust
their GPL'd code to the FSF all the time (look at the jabberd2 code etc.)
but in my experience with code theft, that does not especially seem to
have helped those whose GPL'd code was stolen. Others on this list may
have different or better experiences.

&gt;&gt;<i>A subsidiary issue is whether we might want to develop JOSL 1.1 as one

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>an &quot;intellectual property conservancy&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Will Larry Lessig do pro-bono work for the JSF?
</I>
Maybe. ;-)
