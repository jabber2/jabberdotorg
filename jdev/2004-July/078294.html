<PRE>Since I have a limited testing evironment, I'd like to call on the 
developers to help me isolate bugs and sunmit patches for JCR. For those 
who don't know what JCR is, it is a static library that allows you to 
take a jabberd 1.4 component, and execute it as a standlone process. In 
addition, this also allows these components to run as standalone 
processes for jabberd 2.0.

That being said, here's the catch: JCR implements the mio functions from 
jabberd 1.4 when those mio connections are MIO_RAW. For most components, 
such as transports, this shouldn't be a big limitation.

JCE requires glib 2.0, and will compile and run MU-Conference (0.6.0) 
and the Yahoo! transport (from CVS 2.3.2). Included in both of 
distributions is a Makefile (jcomp.mk) and the main() (main.c) that 
builds both of these. To use this library, extract it and execute 'make' 
in the jcr-0.2.2 directory. This will build the library. Extract one of 
the above components as a sub-directory of jcr-0.2.2, then execute 'make 
-f jcomp.mk' in the components sub-directory. If all goes well, you 
should end up with a binary.

Example XML config files for JCR are included, and the READMEs have 
information on the parameters for the configuration. Note specifically 
the debug level and logging command line options.

Questions should be posted to the list, and patches can be sent directly 
to me. There may still be some code that won't compile with gcc 2.95 ... 
I think I changed it all. (If not, let me know) The only issue I have 
encountered is reconnections to the jabberd (both 1.4 and 2.0) on some 
occasions. I haven't determined why the reconnect fails, and I'm hoping 
someone here will help discover what is happening.

The tar file is available at <A HREF="http://jabber.terrapin.com/jcr-0.2.2.tar.gz">http://jabber.terrapin.com/jcr-0.2.2.tar.gz</A>

Regards,
Paul
