maybe i am just so aware of it because the dutroux trial in belgium just 
started once more.
and we should keep in mind microsoft's action when they closed chatrooms 
due to porn.

i don't want to be a law enforcer, but i want to give administrators a 
chance to keep their server clean - in case of relaying - internet 
service providers, which owners of jabber servers are, are (at least in 
germany and propably in other 1st world countries) responsible for the 
content (ISP regulations) flowing through or from their server.

i know from many of the public flirt servers that logging of all 
conversations is very usual. Not only to protect kids, but to stay 
secure against political radical communication as well. of course 
secure, ciphered communications do out-leverage logging, but at least in 
one case i know of IRC administrators forbidding crypted communication 
on their (very big) server. you know, if a party secures their 
communication then it's ment to stay private, which is ok, since 
securing a communication is going along with less handsome tools, at 
least in most cases.
