Hi, 

I would like to do something with jabber that doesn't seem to be doable
for now. I'm not sure how many people would see interest in the same
requierement, as i am used to special and weird ideas. 

Please, let me know what you think about my way of planning thing, and
how much current protocol might or might not evolve to help support my
needs.

I'll most likely work on the development needed to do it, but i already
know there will be monthes before i'll get anything usefull and running.

------------------------------------------
My need:

I want to have a client connected 24/7 (or almost), getting all
messages, being usable, most likely in a screen, so i can get to it
anytime.

Then, i might want to use a different client, like a client with an
graphical interface, and take back everything where i were. History, 
same chat in progress, and i want it to be a completly invisible change
for people i talk with. To be completly transparent, I would also need
to get &quot;recent&quot; both way activity back in my new launched client, to let
it open the recent windows, with complete history about what we spoke
off.

------------------------------------------
First idea:

Get a daemon to run in background, keeping the connection, and the
status.  When a client connect (and auth, if I use a network socket),
send back &quot;recent&quot; stanzas, but i would need an &quot;already seen&quot;
information.

The daemon would also have to keep track of all outgoing information, to
give back a full conversation state.

------------------------------------------
Second idea:

Let the daemon keep track of more than one user at the same time, it is
not that much more work anyway.
It would need to authenticate user, so make it a server, with a special
component doing the job. It will allow a single client, getting to the
server to manage more than one jabber account.

------------------------------------------
Realistic way of doing it:

* get the server to log all messages for a while, and let him give you
  them back on demand. (&quot;last 15 minutes communications&quot; and/or &quot;last
  communications from/to jid&quot;)

* get a jabber2jabber transport/component, letting a single client
  connection to manage more than one jabber account (usefull to have a
  &quot;work&quot; account, used in-company, and a &quot;personal&quot; account, for
  personal use on a public server).

------------------------------------------
Realistic requierement:
* a way to tell a server to keep the &quot;online&quot; presence, even after a
  disconnect, and not send a new presence information on reconnect
  within the periode (don't flood everyone with presences)

  Note1: it would also be nice for web applications, letting them poll
  every few minutes, to get informations, and keep the online status.

  Note2: the component/transport could do the job, so a workaround is
  easily possible.

* possibility for two client different client to get the messages, to
  prevent misrouting message.

* a jabber2jabber transport/component, to manage an other account with a
  single client

* a way to have more than one client identity within a single client
  tcp/ip connection to a server (would be usefull for the jabber2jabber
  transport). Would also be a nice way to implement multi account on a
  single server, for client supporting multi simultaneous account.

* possibility for a client to ask his user's &quot;recent&quot; communication.
  (letting it restore history in all windows)

------------------------------------------
All comments are welcome.

If anyone already has documentation on already existing implementation
of any part, please let me know.
If anyone knows of good, easy to use tools to develop quickly, let me
know.


As for my language development, it will most likely be C or C++.
I won't use anything like php, python, perl, sh, .net, as i need real
stuffs, with speed and robustness, running on unix platform.

I don't think i'll use java, but that's more because i don't know it
well enough to do correct enough code with it using network heavy
network without having tons of threads. If you can find something in
java doing what poll/select does, i might think about it more. If there
are people out there willing to develop a server in java, knowing
something like poll/select, give me a ring, i might want to work on it
too.
