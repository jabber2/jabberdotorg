Didn't find much information about it, but it seems like it's a program
running on the web server that keep the connection for the user. If
that's it, it require the web server to be able to go out through the
jabber port. From what i read, that's what most jabber webapps wants to
avoid, using a special protocol.

For webserver allowing such connection, your project is surely a very
good idea. What i seek is rather more server support (like for
keep-alive after disconnect feature).

My appology to anyone that understood that comment of mine in the bad
way. I was mostly talking about stuffs to put on a server, and on a
server, i don't want scripts, as they are too slow, and usually not
able to hold the load. For client, scripts might be a good idea, all
depends on what we really want.
I also don't like scripts because they tend to have unwanted behaviour
to often. (mainly because most devellopers - like *me* - doesn't know
how to handle them properly to start with). Same could go with C and
C++, but I have more experience at them.

The best programming language is the one you best know.
