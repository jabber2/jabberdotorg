<PRE>&gt;<i> Hmm...this is interesting.  I was under the impression that 90% of all
</I>&gt;<i> home NAT devices would be either Full Cone or (Port) Restricted Cone.  Not
</I>&gt;<i> sure why I thought that though.  I know we have Symmetric NAT's at work,
</I>&gt;<i> but they are used to connect our outsourced customers networks to our own
</I>&gt;<i> - not much VoIP happening there.
</I>
Well my MSN messenger 6 at home tells me I am using a symmetric NAT, and it
also does so at work via both of our ADSL lines, one a watchguard firewall,
and one an ADSL router/firewall which as luck would have it has UPnP.

&gt;<i> WinStun (<A HREF="http://www.vovida.org/applications/downloads/stun/">http://www.vovida.org/applications/downloads/stun/</A>) tells me I
</I>&gt;<i> have a Cone NAT (So I'm alright Jack!).  Have you run it on your machine?
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be interested to see what it says.  Also Skype cuts though my NAT
</I>&gt;<i> router like a hot knife though butter, so if they are using STUN it seems
</I>&gt;<i> to work for everyone I know who has tried it.
</I>
Ill check it out later.

&gt;<i> Well - a couple of problems with this.  For those outside the US, there
</I>&gt;<i> may not be much choice as the IP allocation in some countries can be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;somewhat less&quot; than other countries - as I understand it.  Also, if you
</I>&gt;<i> are Joe/Jane Sixpack, you may have no idea that your ISP has installed a
</I>&gt;<i> cascading NAT - all you may know is that your Jabber telephony stopped
</I>&gt;<i> working, and you might be tempted to blame the product rather than your
</I>&gt;<i> ISP, which is letting you surf the web and check your email just fine.
</I>
Im in the UK and IP allocation seems fine but I expect it is worse in other
countries, but surely a client would be able to present the user with a
message indicating that it cannot connect because of problems with the ISP,
so users wouldnt be tempted to blame the software.
