<PRE>&gt;<i> i don't want to be a law enforcer, but i want to give administrators a
</I>&gt;<i> chance to keep their server clean - in case of relaying - internet
</I>&gt;<i> service providers, which owners of jabber servers are, are (at least in
</I>&gt;<i> germany and propably in other 1st world countries) responsible for the
</I>&gt;<i> content (ISP regulations) flowing through or from their server.
</I>
  So, you WANT to be able to filter voicechat?  I'm failing to see what
ANY of this has to do with setting it up via Jabber.  ANY application
can open up a voice conference using existing technologies.  That's what
firewalls are for.  To block and or resitrict access to given things. 
Unless you're talking about implementing a BRAND NEW audio or video
system, I fail to see what relevence this has to do with anything.

&gt;<i> i know from many of the public flirt servers that logging of all
</I>&gt;<i> conversations is very usual. Not only to protect kids, but to stay
</I>&gt;<i> secure against political radical communication as well. of course
</I>&gt;<i> secure, ciphered communications do out-leverage logging, but at least in
</I>&gt;<i> one case i know of IRC administrators forbidding crypted communication
</I>&gt;<i> on their (very big) server. you know, if a party secures their
</I>&gt;<i> communication then it's ment to stay private, which is ok, since
</I>&gt;<i> securing a communication is going along with less handsome tools, at
</I>&gt;<i> least in most cases.
</I>
  Again, Jabber wouldnt and isn't being discussed as a way to relay the
actual audio and or video data.  Hence, I fail too see what relevence
any of this has to do with using the jabber protocol to negotiate.
