very nice, good work.

</I>
Excellent idea? However, I still need a logical way to discover the
hierarchical node tree of a field device. Having a form with hundreds of
fields will be overwhelming. So could I discover the nodes (which
contain an entry for this hidden field) then use iq:register with a
hidden field to remap things back together.


&gt;<i> The other way around
</I>&gt;<i> this, would be to map the device-id's to &quot;user&quot; part of a JID: like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">vertical.ch1.scale at scope1.foo.org</A>
</I>
Let's talk about this, this would lead to thousands of jids, a scope
alone has a couple hundred values, so you'd end up with

<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">vertical.ch1.scale at scope1.foo.org</A>
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">vertical.ch2.scale at scope1.foo.org</A>
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">vertical.ch3.scale at scope1.foo.org</A>
etc.

This seems like a mess from my limited jabber coding experience. I'm
using python and from what I've done, I'd have to start up a thread to
handle communications for each of these jids, not to mention that all
these need to registered on the server. I suppose there's a better way
of doing this. I'm all ears, I'm looking for simplisticity.

I first started out thinking that I could use the resource in a JID like
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">scope1 at foo.org</A>/vertical.ch1.scale. I was going to write a client for
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">scope1 at foo.org</A> and looked at the resource to figure out what to do. I
quickly found out that the server rewrites the complete jid, ignoring
what I specified in the from attribute.

&gt;<i> This is essentially what adhoc commands is. You just need more widespread
</I>&gt;<i> support in clients.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this clears some things up.
</I>
Yes, this definately helped. I'll re-read the ad-hoc commands again and try to
piece in this conversation. 

Ultimately, one my research goals is to determine bandwidth utilization of 
XML protocol for instrumentation. My architecture will inform 
listeners/subscribers of any field device parameter change (either through 
network commands or front panel operation) via asynchronous messaging. Instead of 
continuous polling, sub-systems will just get update messages if something has
changed.

I haven't figured out how to distribute these update messages either. Fortunately,
the Jabber environment offers several options to send value information including
presence via &lt;x/&gt;, chat room message with value info in &lt;x/&gt;, and pubsub. Any other 
ideas?

Thanks again for your comments.
Craig
