<PRE>Hi.

well, i followed the previous thread and it's my first mail this morning.

* jabber.helixcommunity.org merges helix and jabber
* question of belief whether p2p or server
* server allows more control, i.e. to ban kiddiepornsters on public servers
* good NAT traversal in a few years won't solve anything now
* TCP is more than sufficient for speex data transmission
    * speex crunches 1600 bytes of PCM into 21 bytes of speex (YES!)
* political question whether we should agree to ONE codec or design a 
codec independent protocol
* Skype constantly (about every minute) causes communication disrupts
    * judge yourself is this is good or not
* 1-to-1 chat and MUC cover all use cases for voice/video as well
* consensus in this unified multi media messaging protocol needs to be found

</I>&gt;<i>We really need to define a standard for this ASAP.  Even if half the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I say we go P2P.  If anyone has doubts, they should download Skype and
</I>&gt;<i>have a play with it.  I think we need to look seriously at STUN as a NAT
</I>&gt;<i>traversal standard - I believe this is what Skype uses and it seems to
</I>&gt;<i>work very well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Speex looks cool for an open codec (not that I have looked at it in detail)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think this &quot;Upgrading&quot; from IM to voice is really going to take off in
</I>&gt;<i>the next few years.  I do it a bit already at work with the phone, and
</I>&gt;<i>it's &quot;Umm...what's your number...ok... *dial*...*ring*...Hello?&quot;  It's
</I>&gt;<i>going to be so much more convenient when you can just click a button in
</I>&gt;<i>your chat session and start talking to your computer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Voice conferencing would be very nice to have (again Skype just added it)
</I>&gt;<i>but user-to-user should be the first goal.  I suspect something like 90%
</I>&gt;<i>of telephone calls are between two users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>please don't suspect - give a source for your number. i don't believe 
your 90%.

&gt;<i>Video (webcams) have a big &quot;wow&quot; factor that currently is only limited by
</I>&gt;<i>bad NAT traversal.  Expect this to take off in the next few years also.
