OK, it seems like this happens automatically already, so I think I have 
done this as well, just by providing a combined public/private key PEM 
file to jabberd2.

&gt;<i> If you do it, just make sure you follow the standard, which is to provide the 
</I>&gt;<i> certificate via the TLS handshake, and use the SASL &quot;EXTERNAL&quot; mechanism to

</I>
I understand that in principal, but the details are the important part. 
  I imagine the c2s.xml &lt;authreg&gt; section will require a number of 
changes, and possibly also the sm.xml &lt;module&gt; chains.  On the client 
side it is no longer just a matter of establishing an encypted SSL link 
between two hosts, but actually verifying the certificate trust chain 
back to a trusted CA.

Furthermore, I don't quite see how the whole thing fits together since 
servers are trusted to forward messages.  Without some fixed mapping of 
CA certificate to (probably a set of) JID (sort of like a CA signing 
policy file), and cryptographically signed jabber messages, I would have 
thought it was very easy for a rogue (or hacked) server to fabricate 
messages, since there is no user-user (or client-client, or JID-JID) 
certificate authentication.

&gt;<i> You mention jabberd, but not the version.  You'll have better luck with this 
</I>&gt;<i> in jabberd2, as it already supports XMPP 1.0.  I don't recommend trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> retrofit this onto jabberd1.
</I>
I'm using jabberd2 already on the server side, and jabberpy-0.5 on the 
client side, although I'll look at xmpppy-0.1 if that is a better idea.

Cheers,

Ian
