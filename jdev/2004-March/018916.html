<PRE>Hi Peter,


&gt;<i> There is a long, long thread starting there. Lots of talk about Speex,
</I>&gt;<i> H.323, p2p vs. client-server, and so on. As far as I can see, no
</I>&gt;<i> consensus ever emerged. It seems that people want some kind of voice
</I>&gt;<i> integration (maybe video too, but I think that's farther out).
</I>
i had started the videothread last year and was busy in the meantime
(with linux). For me the video stuff is also important then the
audio stuff. I hope that once a jabber conferencing systems runs on a
PDA connected via wireless lan.

&gt;<i> They want
</I>&gt;<i> to do 1-to-1 voice chat and maybe even multi-user voice-conferencing.
</I>&gt;<i> They want to be able to negotiate that over Jabber and then go out of
</I>&gt;<i> band to do the voice stuff. They want this to work from behind NATs and
</I>&gt;<i> firewalls. They don't want to open crazy ports in the firewall (or turn
</I>&gt;<i> off the firewall entirely!) in order to get this done. 
</I>
Exactly. You make the point!!!!

&gt;<i> The only message
</I>&gt;<i> I posted in that thread pointed out that research indicates people don't
</I>&gt;<i> actually upgrade from IM to voice or video all that often (by &quot;upgrade&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> I mean something as simple as picking up the phone or meeting f2f, not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily switching from IM to VoIP or whatever). So I still have my
</I>&gt;<i> doubts about how necessary or important this really is, but I do hear
</I>&gt;<i> the question more and more: &quot;When is Jabber going to support voice?&quot; 
</I>
Exactly! IM stuff is nice, but Audio stuff can replace the telephone
and allow you much more thinks. This becomes much more interesting with
the new powerfull PDA's with webcam and wireless lan!

&gt;<i> It seems to me that first of all we need to get clear on the use cases 
</I>&gt;<i> and requirements. Do we want the ability to negotiate telephone-quality 
</I>&gt;<i> voice chat between two IM users? That seems to be the base case (after
</I>&gt;<i> all we treat chat and groupchat differently in Jabber, why not treat
</I>&gt;<i> voicechat and voice-conference differently?). 
</I>
Yes!

 &gt; [Of course maybe it is
 &gt;...
&gt;<i> So could we potentially do Speex over TCP using a JEP-0065 proxy (or p2p
</I>&gt;<i> as defined in that JEP) for voicechat? I realize that it would not work
</I>&gt;<i> for voice-conference and might not be perfect, but is it possible? Just
</I>&gt;<i> curious. Again, I'm sorry if we've hashed all this out already -- that
</I>&gt;<i> was a long thread to catch up on and I am not deeply knowledgeable about
</I>&gt;<i> this voice/video stuff.
</I>
Me too. We have also must take care that there are patent on VoIP and 
that we MUST consider that!

Best regards,
