<PRE>I originally posted this in the jadmin list but perhaps that was the
wrong list?  There was no response.

This problem has really got me stuck.  I have successfully installed and
setup jabberd2 version 2.0s2 using mysql.  Using Exodus, I can register
a new user and connect with no trouble.  The problem comes when I try to
import the users from my 1.4.2 setup using
<A HREF="http://scriptrepo.jabberstudio.org/tx_migrate/">http://scriptrepo.jabberstudio.org/tx_migrate/</A>
One person on this list said that the script messed up the realm and
didn't put entries in the active table.  Fixing the realm problem was
easy and I was able to put the data into mysql.  The active table
problem didn't seem like it would be a problem because I read in
<A HREF="http://www.jabberdoc.org/app_faq.html">http://www.jabberdoc.org/app_faq.html</A> &quot;I just created a user in the
database. Why can't I login as the user I just created?&quot;  so I
uncommented the auto-create tag in sm.xml.  When I try to log in with
one of the users in the imported list, sm crashes with

ERROR: sm died.  Shutting down server.
JBRD: Got a signal... pass it on.
JBRD: It was a TERM.  Shut it all down!

Next I tried manually adding a users to mysql as in the FAQ.  This
worked and sm didn't crash.  Can anyone help with this?  Why does sm
crash on a user that has been added to authreg by this script but not
on a user that has been manually added to authreg?

While trying to figure this out, I tried to find information about the
mysql tables.  I would like to know the meaning or purpose of each table
and field but <A HREF="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/dev/">http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/dev/</A> I see nothing about
the mysql tables.  Is there any document describing the tables?
