<PRE>Hi.

I've been trying to get my jabberd2 up and running for some time and am 
having a similar problem with sm not wanting to stay around.

Along the way someone suggested that I was importing lists of users and
one of these users had funky characters in them which caused the sm to
die.  You should take a look at the user names and see if there's anything 
that doesn't look right... ?

Incidentally it didn't help me, because I only had one user whose 
characters were in the a-z range.  Maybe it will help you.
