<PRE>Hi.

Thanks for your fast response.

Yes, I figured that out a couple of minutes ago as well.

You're absolutely right - that would be a strange
requirement. A bit like having to set up multiple
telephone switches just to be able to call to
the US *and* Germany :-)

Which sort of brings me to the conclusion that
we'd have only JSO to build on since there
appears to be no other Java library supporting the
server namespace (or - probably better - we could
contribute that part to one of the existing
Java libraries out there).

Is S2S sufficiently supported and accepted in
today's deployed servers, so that it's something
we can actually expect to work? I want to add
something that works and that people can really
use, not just support another buzz-word.

Daniel.
