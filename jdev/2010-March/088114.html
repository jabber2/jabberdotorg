Hello,

The ability to multiplex multiple resources is certainly desirable. 
It is too bad that it has missed the core spec at this point.

Strange however, that draft-ietf-xmpp-3920bis-04 still contains the 
text in section 1.1 Overview:

&quot;Defined of optional support for multiple resources over the same connection&quot;

Yet no where in that draft revision does it discuss multiple resources 
anymore.&#160; The last draft I could locate this in is:

<A HREF="http://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis-10.html#bind-multi">http://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis-10.html#bind-multi</A>

Anyway, my use case for this is generalized as such, and is not IM related:

An internet connected client exists for <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">node at example.com</A>, this client 
is the interface to many non internet enabled clients which are 
 identified by resources <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">node at example.com</A>/x1,x2..xn, where n could be a 
fairly large number.&#160; As x1..xn are all associated in a particular way 
for this use case, it makes sense (for reasons not here explained) that 
they are connected using a single bare JID, besides the fact that 
maintaining many streams/connections is certainly not ideal and even 
problematic.

It'd be great to see this put back in the draft-ietf-xmpp-3920bis. :)

I imagine that as XMPP moves further passed the IM world, these types 
of needs will become more apparent.&#160; It is unfortunate a forward looking 
update to the protocol was axed for the lack of understanding its use 
cases.
