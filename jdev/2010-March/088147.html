Hi!

I hope your interested in letting the XSF host your GSoC project.  If
so, then we need to add it to the Project Ideas wiki page at
<A HREF="http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2010_Project_Ideas">http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2010_Project_Ideas</A>  so that we
can find a mentor for the project and also so that you can get the
information together for the GSoC council to vote on your project.

If not, well I tried ;) -- but yea, you will find the folks to answer
your question here.

thanks!

&gt;<i> Hi, everyone!
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160;I'm a graduate student studying computer science and I've been exploring
</I>&gt;<i> both the XEPs concerning jingle file transfer and playing with the gajim
</I>&gt;<i> client's source code for the last 6 weeks. Since gajim already has the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to handle the jingle protocol and establish socks5 bytestream to
</I>&gt;<i> transfer file, implementing file transfer over jingle for gajim shouldnt' be
</I>&gt;<i> too difficult. There are just several things I don't quite understand and I
</I>&gt;<i> need your advice :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;As far as I know the jingle protocol is kind of similar to the original
</I>&gt;<i> stream initiation(xep-0095) conceptually. Apart from jingle being a newer,
</I>&gt;<i> more general session negotiation protocol(general in the sense that there
</I>&gt;<i> are already video, voice calls applications built on jingle) and SI
</I>&gt;<i> practically being used only by SI file transfer(xep-0096), what are the
</I>&gt;<i> advantages that jingle has over SI? Surely there are already clients that
</I>&gt;<i> has support for jingle file transfer(pidgin, gtalk) so we definitely will
</I>&gt;<i> see more clients implementing this, but, is there anything extra that jingle
</I>&gt;<i> has brought us so we can improve the file transfer process? What's the
</I>&gt;<i> rationale behind implementing file transfer over jingle given SI file
</I>&gt;<i> transfer already works fine?
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;Also I've talked to asterix about some extra features I want to implement
</I>&gt;<i> in gajim. The first one is channel encryption. The only protocol I find
</I>&gt;<i> relevant is XTLS, which says it has already expired here. So it seems there
</I>&gt;<i> will be no standard way to implement this feature, right? Is there any
</I>&gt;<i> possibility this &quot;XEP&quot; will become a draft someday? Or is there any standard
</I>&gt;<i> way to encrypt the channel in the XMPP stack? The second feature that I want
</I>&gt;<i> to implement is transferring multiple files in one shot. But it seems that
</I>&gt;<i> according to jingle file transfer the receiver has to accept file transfer
</I>&gt;<i> one by one anyway. So I'm considering archiving the files and then send it.
</I>&gt;<i> But this is not accepted by everybody. The main argument being the receiver
</I>&gt;<i> does not know he/she has to unzip the archive. What I think is that this is
</I>&gt;<i> rather more related to how the client reacts to events like drag and drop of
</I>&gt;<i> several files. If the user is notified that files will be archived before
</I>&gt;<i> they are sent, I don't think he/she will be confused. So, what's your
</I>&gt;<i> opinion? I'd like to hear it:-) . Another feature I want to implement is
</I>&gt;<i> jingle IBB transport method. This is according to XEPs a must but for some
</I>&gt;<i> reasons it is not in gajim. After implementing this feature failed file
</I>&gt;<i> transfer attempts should fall back on IBB file transfer.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;These are some initial thoughts. Comments, advices, suggestions are all
</I>&gt;<i> welcomed!
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;I'm pursuing a master of science degree in Fudan University, China.&#160;I'm
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable with C, C++, perl. And I love Python and lisp! I have played
</I>&gt;<i> with the linux kernel, netsurf the web browser and some other open source
</I>&gt;<i> projects, been a heavy user of open source softwares. I really hope I can do
</I>&gt;<i> something this summer to further improve my skills and contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP community. You can find me &#160;as fantasticsid on irc, jabber.com, and
</I>&gt;<i> also the blog and email below.
