I'd note that &quot;here&quot; seems to be jdev.

I've copied my response in to both standards and social - the latter  
because I think that's the community most likely to be interested,  
and it'll prod them into joining the conversation - but for now at  
least responses to jdev.

I do think we should work on a solid, thought-through proposal,  
ideally with some degree of implementation experience.

WebSockets appear to be moving again, to my eye - however this is  
largely because several people - including myself - who thought the  
entire thing had gone to pot have all but quit making any comments.

&gt;<i> &gt; A few things that browser-based XMPP would help make possible:

I don't think any of these will be contentious to this community. :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; I believe the critical opposing arguments that will be voiced  
</I>&gt;<i> fall into one of several categories:
</I>
However, these were all, I think, way off the mark, based on my  
experience with the delights of HyBi.

The criticism will centre on two aspects, and we should ensure we  
have a compelling story for both.

Firstly, security.

What we need to understand is that the web browser vendors feel that  
security starts and ends at the browser. So WebSockets got derailed  
into insanity essentially due to a vulnerability that isn't even  
proven to exist, hence the reason that it's now encrypted on the  
outflow from the browser.

So we need to ensure that for Web integration, we have suitable hooks  
into the Web authorization model, which is basically the SOP and  
CORS. So we'll need Origin controls for allowing connections from a  
browser.

Now you're forgiven for thinking that since we can't retrofit these  
as a mandatory portion of the server, then therefore we also cannot  
do anything useful in this regard, but it's important to note that  
the browser vendors believe that their products will suitably sandbox  
the protocols; in other words, if we mandate that the first thing an  
XMPP client in a browser does when setting up a session, or prior to  
handing over control to the Javascript, is query the server and/or  
service as to whether the Origin is allowed to work its magic, then  
we can actually rely on this happening. This is largely because we  
won't be allowing unmediated access to XMPP, instead we'll be  
providing some kind of Javascript layer onto an XMPP session entirely  
under the browser's control.

So, *before* we approach the browser vendors, we need a compelling  
story on Origin-based security.

Next, deployability.

There's this myth of the amateur programmer floating about, and many  
flocks of ideas have been shot down with that particular cannon.

In practical terms, this means we need to get strong anecdotal  
evidence that setting up an XMPP server, and having users provisioned  
with XMPP accounts as required, are both simple and straightforward  
things to do. I see this as a task for the communications teams of  
the XSF, involving interviewing people building services on XMPP and  
stressing how easy it all is to do. I can't imagine that there'll be  
much resistence from such people to talk about their services, and  
it'd be interesting content for the blog anyway.

So, again before approaching the browser vendors, we need a  
compelling story on ease of deployment.

Dave.
