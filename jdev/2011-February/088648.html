<PRE>Hi folks,

Yesterday I accidentally set myself to invisible, and realised that I'd
parted all the MUCs I was in. I went off to consult XEP-0126 and
XEP-0186 to see what they say about MUCs, and the answer&#8212;to my
surprise&#8212;is &#8220;nothing&#8221;. I believe it should be possible to join MUCs
while invisible, and remain in MUCs when you transition from visible to
invisible.

XEP-0186 &#167;3.1 stipulates that, when the user becomes invisible:

&gt;<i> the server MUST send &lt;presence type='unavailable'/&gt; presence from the
</I>&gt;<i> specified resource to all contacts who would receive unavailable
</I>&gt;<i> presence if the client sent &lt;presence type='unavailable'/&gt;.
</I>
I think we could add:

&gt;<i> but not to contacts who have received
</I>&gt;<i> directed presence from the client (for instance, &lt;a
</I>&gt;<i> href='xep-0045'&gt;Multi-User Chat&lt;/a&gt; rooms the user is a member of).
</I>
While the client is invisible, the server MUST relay everything we need
for MUCs in both directions, so it's only the visible&#8594;invisible
transition that needs clarification.

XEP-0126 is more problematic. It could recommend the the client be
selectively visible to each MUC's JID, as per &#167;3.2.1, which would allow
joining MUCs while invisible. But &#167;3.5 says that the user becomes
invisible by first broadcasting unavailable presence.  Thus, the
visible&#8594;invisible transition parts all your MUCs. Any suggestions for
how to deal with this, short of:

&#8226; Activate a privacy list blocking outbound presence to your MUCs;
&#8226; Broadcast unavailable presence (which will not be sent to the
  aforementioned MUCs);
&#8226; Invert the privacy list, to *only* allow presence-out to those MUCs.

which sounds nuts to me. :)

Regards,
