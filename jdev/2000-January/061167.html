I have been thinking about a system that would allow for users to store a
database of sorts on a site, and have it be made available for people. This
seems very much like what you planned, and equally vague. One obvious
application would be to make other contact information - email address,
phone numbers, address, etc, available. There would have to be some sort of
trust system involved, as most people would not want to be handing out their
phone number to anyone.

This will mean a not-insubstantial additional amount of work on the part of
client writers. It seems like integration with a system such as openpgp
would also be crucial, as one would want to make sure information was only
going to the desired people.

Does anyone have any ideas on how this all should be implemented? Have any
client writers or security team members tried to integrate pgp into jabber
yet (talking about it doesn't count :)?

Peter
