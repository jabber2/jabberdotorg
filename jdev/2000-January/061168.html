<PRE>Yeah, I'm starting this real soon now and have layed out what all will be in
the 0.9 release on the security mailing list.  I would suggest reading the
back logs in there.  JUD is designed to be universal data, SO whatever you
send to it is considered shared data and can be searched.

To answer other questions in this thread:

As of now, my understanding was that we were going to make JUD completely
seperate from jabber.  This is for reasons a lot like etherx.  The tool is
very useful in many applications not specific to jabber.
