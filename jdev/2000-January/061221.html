<PRE>&gt;<i>  Your opinion.  The 'long wrong' as you put it, is the way it's been for
</I>&gt;<i>nearly 30 years, and no ones right/wrong.  Your method also causes 'data
</I>&gt;<i>stagnation', aka, if it's ALWAYS in the config file, and I can move it around,
</I>&gt;<i>when do I actually have to enter my username/password?  Not to mention, it
</I>&gt;<i>also leads to the issue of what happens when someone get's their hands on that
</I>&gt;<i>file, eh?  Full access..  ;-P
</I>I beg to differ about stagnation. It prevents it, if you connect from multiple
places it can mean they all have the same data. (Hence my allusion to Roaming
Access in Netscape)

You can enter your name/pass in your client if you leave them out of the
config file.

The password should ideally never be sent up to the server. But hey, if you're
not worried about security and using an open connection to logon, then what
difference does it make if you send it once more in the clear? This is one
reason I suggested two files...

But different clients MAY share configurtion data, color schemes for
example. Or hey, anybody remember twm? what about vtwm.gamma? vtwm.gamma could
use a twm config file... 


Also, as far as saving general jabber data goes, I think people have glossed
over one of (IMHO) the good ideas, in being quick to discount the others....
Namely mutltiple sets of config data... (default, work, home, etc.)

What about the standardized switches?

Also, rememebr this would all be VOLUNTARY. Jabber clients need not comply
with anything more than the Jabber protocol itself. Of course, if you don't
make your client play nice it might not get used ;-P
