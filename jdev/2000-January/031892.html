<PRE>Hey everyone, I'm new to the Jabber project and just wanted to say hi,
here I am, and ask a couple questions.

I'll try to be of as much help as possible, I'm a 2nd year Comp Sci.
major and have some (1.5 years) programming experience in C++, some
TCL, lots of web design experience, graphic design...anything I can
help with I'll try it out.  I joined Jabber to learn more about
programming (sockets and Internet usage mostly) and because I was
thinking about making a universal messenger anyways and here half the
work is done already. :)

I've been playing with C++Builder and working on a win32 client, I've
gotten the sockets and connections to work thanks to the folks in
#jabber.  Once this is done I have plans to port it to Linux (how is
that side of the project going?).  My first connected app woohoo!  This
brings me to my first question: I've signed up for the win32 and jdev
lists, so am I &quot;officially&quot; on the Jabber team?

My second question is about XML parsing... I downloaded Jabberoo and
was wondering if there are any docs on how to implement it? :D  I've
poked through the header files and, being the
not-quite-super-programmer I am, got myself lost...  I asked in #jabber
and I guess it was being worked on then, but I haven't found it yet.

Well thanks and good luck to everyone! :)
