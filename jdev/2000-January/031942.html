<PRE>It seems that we have varying viewpoints as to where the data should
go.  We all agree that if you were to get up from your machine in Dallas
and go to New Orleans to another machine that you want your same
settings to follow you.  But that means they have to have server side
config.

On the other hand sometimes we want to know the settings before we start
so that window placements and stuff can get done before we connect.

So it sounds like we want both.  How about this for a compromise:

All configuration data gets stored server side.  Anything that you
additionally store locally, must be mirrored server side.  Your client
must check that if the local configuration doesn't match the id being
logged in with, then it must wait and connect to grab the settings and
then it can run off the local copy.  If a user makes a change then the
changes are mirrored up to the server.

Same type of deal with the various resources you can connect with
(Home/Work/etc..)  The local configuration files must be saved in such a
way that it picks it up off the userid.  You don't have to log in, but
if that userid doesn't exist in the local config file then you must
connect to get the settings.

Local config files will be in XML.  They will have the same format as
the iq:info tags that you get from the server to minimize parsing code.

&lt;x/&gt; tags can be embedded in the iq:info tags to facilitate clients
storing their own data where needed.  (For example which MP3 to start
playing with the user connects...)

Thoughts?
