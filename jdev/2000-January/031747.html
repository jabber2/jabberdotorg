<PRE>I think you didn't understand me.

The problem is not to substitute multiple dialog boxes with just one dialog.
The annoying part is to pay attention to dozens of subscription requests
during the chat session. For well-known users I would like to set my
permission/rejection setting just once and the client application silently
to give the right response without bothering me.
Also, responding to subscription requests is not one-time process during
startup. It is up to the other peers to decide when to bother you with
subscription requests ;-). You can well have to answer one request every two
minutes or ten at a time during your chat session.

So, I need an information field for each user in my roster that instructs
the client how to handle subscription requests by the particular user for
me. I can maintain such information locally on the machine, but since my
roster info is on the server, its is a good idea my preferences for the
buddies in the roster also to be on the server and come together with the
roster info.

Best Regards,
Stanislav
