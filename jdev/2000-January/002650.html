Isn't that why we started jabber in the first place? so that we weren't
stuck to one client (or one platform for that matter), and that we can just
go and find (or write) a client that has the features we are looking for..

&gt;<i> plus, if i use client A, then upgrade to client B,
</I>&gt;<i> it'd be nice if my info would transfer over easily....
</I>
&lt;rant&gt;
The one thing about jabber that stands out as exceptional (In my mind anyway
;) is that you can jump around computers/platforms/clients and all your
roster data follows you around.  It would only make sence to store this data
on the server, becuaes lets face it... if you've got to carry around your
jabber config file around, it kindof defeats the purpose right?  I would
rather just log in, and go.. on the other hand, that means that all the
preferences aren't going to be available until I log in, and I actually
*prefer* to have different settings on different computers... but thats'
just me... ;)
&lt;/rant&gt;
