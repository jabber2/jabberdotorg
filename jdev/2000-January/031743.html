<PRE>Hello everybody,

When you have dozens of users in your roster and your name is present in many other rosters, it is inevitable to receive like dozens of presence subscription requests on startup. Acknowledging/declining them will be a very annoying process. I was wondering can't this be automated to some extent.

My suggestion is to add one more informational field for each roster item, managed by the client, that will show whether the presence subscription request should be accepted or rejected. Not to change the existing server logic, it will be the client that will check this field when a subscription request arrives and silently respond to the request.

One solution is to keep this additional info locally, but since the roster info is stored on the server, I think it is a good idea this field to go with the info for each item on the roster list. Once again to emphasize, this field is managed by the client is solely for client information. This will not change the current presence logic, but will automate request processing for well-known and trusted buddies.

Regards,
Stanislav
