<PRE>Hi all,

The Mellium project (an XMPP library in Go) is launching an effort to
add OMEMO (e2e encryption) support to the project. This work would be
funded by a grant that requires that at least one of the contributors
live in the EU. To this end I'm currently seeking a (paid) contributor
from the EU to take on a part of this work. You could work as much or as
little as you want, and the work could be technical, documentation,
graphic design, web design, or even business development! If you'd like
to become a member-owner of Mellium Co-op, and want to get paid to work
on an open source software project at the same time, please reach out by
XMPP or email to <A HREF="https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">sam at samwhited.com</A> with a proposal for what you'd like
to do and the sort of hours and pay you're looking for. Final
compensation will be determined by the grant amount we receive and the
only qualification is that you must live in the EU.

Really anything goes from designing a better website to working on any
part of the library you'd like to writing better documentation and
tutorials. It's up to you!

â€”Sam
