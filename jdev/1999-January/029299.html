<PRE>The win32 client is mostly just for testing, not really a usable
&quot;interface&quot; although some early revs looked really cool :)

Feel free to play around, there are no set &quot;looks&quot; for gui clients yet, so
if you create one it might work as a model for other platforms.

The one notable thing as a difference with Jabber and other systems that
will affect the GUI, is the fact that each user can have multiple
&quot;sessions&quot;, based on nickname for that session, so the gui will need to
have something to display that appropriately, possibly a sudo-tree:

- userID
  o Some Name
  o Work account
  o telnet login
- another user
  o browser login
