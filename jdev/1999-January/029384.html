</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One more thing, I know there is talk about some kind of SMTP interface.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What exactly is the idea behind this? What should it acclomplish? The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ability to send an email to an address and have it delivered to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; person's jabber client? If someone could please explain this it would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great. I may even try to get something working. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, it would be great for the server to be able to send messages on via
</I>&gt;<i> SMTP if there was no other way of direct delivery, so that you could enter
</I>&gt;<i> any Jabber or email address(since they are identically formatted
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A>) and it could be delivered normally either way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, if you can send an email via Jabber, you have to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> recieve it.  Here is a quick rundown on how I would see it all working:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - User enters <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">friend at host.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Jabber transport can't deliver it since the friend isn't a Jabber user
</I>&gt;<i>  - Jabber transport optionally automatically reformats the address to the
</I>&gt;<i>    sendmail forwarding style: friend%<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">host.com at EMAIL</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  - The SMTP/EMAIL transport receives it and sends it via email
</I>&gt;<i>  - The return address is <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at jabberserver.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  - The SMTP transport can either listen directly for incoming email at
</I>&gt;<i>    jabberserver.com, or accept email forwarded from sendmail on that host
</I>&gt;<i>  - Incoming email is delivered to the Jabber transport on that host with a
</I>&gt;<i>    from address formatted like earlier: emailuser%<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">emailserver.com at EMAIL</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hows that sound?  Please feel free to step up and start playing/coding
</I>&gt;<i> this SMTP transport :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jer
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
But when they reply to that address, what if it is actually an e-mail
address that exists on that server? It wouldn't work unless the
jabberserver.com doesn't also act as a real smtp server. For example:

- I try to send a jabber message to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">non-existent at address.com</A>
- the jabber transport can't send it to that of course, and offers to send
  it as a real e-mail
- It really IS an e-mail address so somebody gets it, and replys to
  <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">trep at ctsi.net</A>(both my jabber and my e-mail address). 
- Not the message is in my inbox, waiting for me to download it.
Do you think that jabber should actually act as a mail client and connect
to the POP server and download it? I don't think this is a very good idea. 

An e-mail gateway would be cool, allowing people to send jabber users
messages through an e-mail address, but the only addressing scheme I can
think of is something along the lines of
user%<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jabberhost.com at jabbermailgateway.com.</A> 

Also, something so that messages not read after a certain amount of time
will be forwarded to the users real e-mail. Like Tim MacKenzie suggested.
