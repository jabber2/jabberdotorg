<PRE>Oh, *ugh*.  Netscape's WebMail has a lousy interface for replies.
My apologies if this turns out all fouled up.

Of course, this is how domain names work, so it's doable.

A central name-resolver wouldn't have to do too much work, since
communications would still be going through users' &quot;home&quot; Jabber
servers.  There could even be a community of name-resolvers that
shared the job (via round-robin DNS or a meta-resolver that just
tells you the name of a nearby name-resolver to use).

&gt;<i> Finally, wouldn't it be more of a client part to keep track

An address book, in other words?  This solves the problem of
remembering Jabber addresses, but not of giving them permanence:
one of the arguments in favour of centralized name resolution is
that if I move from one Jabber-enabled ISP to another, my address,
under the current <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A> system, will probably change.

That said, I think that the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A> system is just fine.  If
it turns out to be too much of a hassle, we can just set up a
centralized name resolution system after the fact. People could 
then roll automagical use of it into a new version of the client.
The client would query the central system by handing it some 
universal Jabber ID code, be told the real <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A> address, and 
make the call as before.  

This would be a backward-compatible extension to the client and 
wouldn't affect the installed base of older clients or the servers.  
As such, any concerned citizen could set it up -- expanding it to 
serve as a directory of other addresses too, if desired.

Another measure that would solve the problem of users changing
ISPs would be to give them the ability to leave a forwarding address.
Rather than just saying &quot;no such user,&quot; the Jabber server could say
&quot;moved to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at new-host.</A>&quot;  Of course, this would require changes to
the protocol.
