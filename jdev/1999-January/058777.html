&gt;<i> Would it be possible to get a more detailed explanation of the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> online? I'd love to help if you need it.
</I>
Well, what's there is for the most part just the raw protocol.  I've been
wanting to write up a nice step by step detail of it with explanations,
but that takes time and I'll start having more time in a few weeks.

&gt;<i> What are all of the available &lt;j type='something'&gt;&lt;/j&gt; messages that can
</I>&gt;<i> be sent from the client to the server? What responses are possible for
</I>&gt;<i> each message?
</I>
What you see on the protocol page on the site is it, all the things you
can send and all the responses.

&gt;<i> Is there always a response sent for each message?
</I>
Nope.  Server only talks when it has somethig to say.

&gt;<i> Maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;j type='error'&gt;&lt;/j&gt; for unrecognized types.
</I>
It works similiar to how a browser approaches HTML... the server deals
with what it can understand/decode, anything else is ignored.

To make sure on the initial connection to the port though, that you have a
Jabber server talking and what it understands/version, the client can
optionally do a little type='connection' handshake.

&gt;<i> What about end of lines?
</I>
Nope, &lt;drone type='borg'&gt;Whitespace is irrelevant&lt;/drone&gt;
With XML, the markers/identifiers between different sets of information is
the tags, not the end of lines.

&gt;<i> &gt;From my experimental tinkering with writing a Java client, it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> look like the server sends any end of lines at all. That made it a lot
</I>&gt;<i> harder to collect a response and parse it. I've implemented both text
</I>&gt;<i> protocols like SMTP and POP3 in Java and binary ones like DNS. As much
</I>&gt;<i> more difficult as the binary based ones were to implement and debug, I
</I>&gt;<i> at least knew what to expect as responses.
</I>
I'd HIGHLY reccommend checking out any of the available Java XML parsers
out there, you should be able to feed the stream of data right to them(or
with slight modification/chunking) and they will take care of all of the
nasty parts of deailing with the XML encoding... it's really slick after
you get to that point.
