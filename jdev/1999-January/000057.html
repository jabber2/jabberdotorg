<PRE>Yeah, that was another idea that I was toying with today while working on
some client layout.  I even drew a little diagram of a simple chain of
what the client would have to do, and what the server would have to do for
figuring out someones, real address from a repository.  I also agree
that's it's probably best, to just test the current system.  Why change
everything, when there is a doable system in place.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An address book, in other words?  This solves the problem of
</I>&gt;<i> remembering Jabber addresses, but not of giving them permanence:
</I>&gt;<i> one of the arguments in favour of centralized name resolution is
</I>&gt;<i> that if I move from one Jabber-enabled ISP to another, my address,
</I>&gt;<i> under the current <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A> system, will probably change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I think that the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A> system is just fine.  If
</I>&gt;<i> it turns out to be too much of a hassle, we can just set up a
</I>&gt;<i> centralized name resolution system after the fact. People could 
</I>&gt;<i> then roll automagical use of it into a new version of the client.
</I>&gt;<i> The client would query the central system by handing it some 
</I>&gt;<i> universal Jabber ID code, be told the real <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A> address, and 
</I>&gt;<i> make the call as before.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be a backward-compatible extension to the client and 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't affect the installed base of older clients or the servers.  
</I>&gt;<i> As such, any concerned citizen could set it up -- expanding it to 
</I>&gt;<i> serve as a directory of other addresses too, if desired.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another measure that would solve the problem of users changing
</I>&gt;<i> ISPs would be to give them the ability to leave a forwarding address.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than just saying &quot;no such user,&quot; the Jabber server could say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;moved to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at new-host.</A>&quot;  Of course, this would require changes to
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol.
