<PRE>Ok, I think I might have blundered when I decided to use file sockets on
the server to talk between the different transports.  It's causing me more
greif in porting/setup than I expected.

I did it with unix file sockets since I thought that would be the most
secure way to guarantee that a process was getting a connection only from
the local computer instead of from the net.  I totally missed that the
process could just attach to a port on 127.0.0.1 and it should accomplish
the same thing(since file sockets just map to 38.0.0.x addresses anyway
or something like that :)

So, unless theres any reason not to, I'm going to change the jabberbox
process to listen on localhost:5269 for connections from other transports,
and on local-ip:5269 for connections from other servers.  The protocol
that is sent over both of these is identical, it's just that the ones
connecting on localhost are allowed to &quot;recieve&quot; data routed to them.

Sound good?

Jer
