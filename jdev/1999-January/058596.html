&gt;<i> I finally got jabber working. I didn't notice the server/jabber directory
</I>&gt;<i> (you have to compile and run jabber.transport in addition to jabberbox).
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure having 2 'server' processes is a great idea, but I do like the
</I>&gt;<i> idea of 'pluggable transports'. I don't think anyone would want to unplug
</I>&gt;<i> the main protocol, but people will want to disable ICQ/AIM addresses: If I
</I>&gt;<i> run my own server (and don't use ICQ), then I don't need the ICQ transport
</I>&gt;<i> at all. (If you are using ICQ, then YOUR server will do ICQ for you).
</I>
The(the JabberBox and the native jabber transport) were recently in one
main process, but there was just such a clean break between the two that
it worked well to split them up since they are completly different in
function and philosophy.  I plan on having the main Makefile fire off the
other pieces compiling also, and also generate a shell script to
start/stop the server... just haven't gotten there and I'm not much of a
make wizzard :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you should have a central meta-server which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keeps track of other servers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes and no. Yes, it would be cool for a list of public servers (like public
</I>&gt;<i> freenets, they will give you jabber accounts). But on the other hand, we
</I>&gt;<i> don't need to list ALL servers. For instance, if I run a server on my
</I>&gt;<i> cablemodem linux box, I don't want random people talking to it. It would
</I>&gt;<i> only have my account on it, so nobody else needs to know (except my
</I>&gt;<i> friends). I wouldn't want my jabber server or address listed in a public
</I>&gt;<i> list any more than I want my e-mail on a 'meta-email list'. Since jabber is
</I>&gt;<i> distributed, there is no need for a meta  server.
</I>
Absolutely, just optional for those servers that want to be public, very
similiar to <A HREF="http://shoutcast.com/">http://shoutcast.com/</A>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You might want a meta server for 'phone-book' like address lookups, but I
</I>&gt;<i> think there are enough phonebooks out there that we don't need another. We
</I>&gt;<i> could standardize a jabber URL, so we can click on
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;<A HREF="jabber://bob@nowhere.org&quot;">jabber://bob@nowhere.org&quot;</A> to start a conversation.
</I>
Interesting idea... hmmm... maybe more like email, jabber:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at server.com</A>

It should be relatively easy to add a client to Mozilla after we make a
bit more progress :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The protocol is mostly just for carrying content, not tech details like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ports/etc...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But without standard ports, trying to contact <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at random-server.com</A> won't
</I>&gt;<i> work very well.
</I>
Oh, I absolutely agree on that!  The standard server&lt;-&gt;server port is 5269
and the standard client&lt;-&gt;server port is 5222.
