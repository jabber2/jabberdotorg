<PRE>&gt;<i>It's probably important to measure things before guessing, otherwise you
</I>might
&gt;<i>end up doing the equivalent of optimizing the system idle loop.
</I>
I meant if we can make things faster even a bit without giving out the
flexibility away why won't we? :)

As I know in ICQ v2 protocol an online alert (packet sent from server to
client) is a UDP packet only 10 bytes long (with the advantage of using UINs
of course). In Jabber I can hardly guess but probably would be much longer
than that. Think you have a list of four thousand people in your roster then
measure it :)

&gt;<i>Yes. No. Yes, the parsing might be a little slower, but no, that will not
</I>need
&gt;<i>to make coding harder. You just grab a standard parsing library and hook it
</I>up.
&gt;<i>Look into the SAX interface for Java for an example.
</I>
What if I'm coding in Delphi? :) (I'm currently coding in Delphi in fact
ehhee). And are the standard libs suitable for network-kind of parsing?

&gt;<i>Binary??? Ouch. Directly use structs?? Ouch.
</I>
That worked for ICQ, why won't it work for us? :)

&gt;<i>Which platform, compiler, packing options??
</I>
Packing options what an IP header has :)

&gt;<i>Intel byte-order or Motorolla?
</I>
Say Intel. What about ntohs, htons ? :)

&gt;<i>8,16, 32 or 64 bit alignment???
</I>
Why align?

&gt;<i>What if you change your C/C++ code? Break the protocol???
</I>
No. Allow the protocol itself to tolerate the changes. That's not that much
hard.

&gt;<i>( ever seen the .TGA file format? )
</I>
Nope but now I wonder heheh

&gt;<i>Yes, but XML makes the functional aspect of the protocol so much stronger.
</I>&gt;<i>Noticing a missing '&gt;' is far easier than noticing a missing bit. Besides,
</I>this
&gt;<i>gives you a wealth of tools for viewing the data exchanged, debugging, etc.
</I>
I have to admit but if a protocol which makes sense going to be used, then
why a markup language selected for that? A straight text based protocol
(such as POP3, SMTP) could be used. (Then a new code parsing code would be
needed you're right about that one I'm afraid ehhehe)

finest,

SSG
