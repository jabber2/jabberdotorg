<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a quick question. How are all of the jabber users that might have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me in their roster be notified when I come online?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have time to answer this in detail, but the way it's currently
</I>&gt;<i> done is what you hit on at the bottom.  Since in Jabber your &quot;roster&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> lives on the server side, when you change status only the people in your
</I>&gt;<i> roster that are also online will recieve your status updates.  Of course,
</I>&gt;<i> this will be completly customizable from within a module :)  
</I>
i would recommend against keeping the &quot;roster&quot; on the server side.

for those of you who don't like analysis problems, just believe me.

assuming the &quot;roster&quot; is on the server side, here's the reason:

  1. servers must keep a list of currently logged-in users.
     assuming N users logged at one time, the server must maintain
     N records.
  2. servers maintain a &quot;roster&quot; for each user logged in.
     at worst, each user will have each other user in their roster.
     this means that the total roster list could approach N^2.
     this will be very bad in large installations.

if we can keep memory linear, we'll be in much better shape. higher-order
polynomials are bad.

if we move the storage and maintainance of the rosters to the clients,
we have a maximum of N records on the server and N records on the client.
the records on the client do not add memory, since they are already
necessary.

if we keep the rosters on the clients, this does require that a client
occasionally poll servers to determine the status of roster-members,
but this is only a small bit of traffic, and could be piggy-backed on
some other transmission.

of course, the transmission is more expensive than the other way, but this
seems like a managable tradeoff.
