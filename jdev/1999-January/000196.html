<PRE>Looks like majordomo was upset with this one, here it is:

Subject: Re: [JDEV] Status Notifications /  Server requirements - Request for advise
Date: Tue, 19 Jan 1999 22:37:36 -1000

&gt;&gt;<i> Why not have the server store your roster list in your account (thus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowing user/computer roaming), and when the user opens the client and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connects to their particular server, have the roster list downloaded from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the server to the client.  The server could then check to see who on that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> roster is online at the time the connection is made and download that
</I>info
&gt;&gt;<i> to the client (Either with the roster, or right after downloading it).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After that the server does no more checking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...[much content compressed]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>All that you've said is exactly how it currently works, except for the
</I>&gt;<i>fact that all the client has to do is send it's new status to the server
</I>&gt;<i>and the SERVER forwards that status on to all of the users listed in the
</I>&gt;<i>roster.  It's far better this way so that the &quot;intelligence&quot; is actually
</I>&gt;<i>handled by the modules living on the server, and some people might want to
</I>&gt;<i>handle status's differently so they can just write/change the server
</I>&gt;<i>module and customize it w/o ever changing anything in the clients...
</I>

Oops, sorry.  No more comments needed on that one I guess.

&gt;<i>I really don't think anything about Jabber is going to be eating
</I>&gt;<i>disk/cpu/bandwidth any time soon for any server, but I'm looking forward
</I>&gt;<i>to the days when it does become that popular :)
</I>

It will.  Just before coming across your web site, I was mulling around
about coding a client to combine ICQ and AIM, since I have friends on either
but not usually on both (and I`m sure there are many others in the same
predicament).  The desktop space required to view and chat on the IMs, and
browse the web is too great.  As far as I know there isn`t anything else
like this out (or being developed to this scale).  Jabber is a perfectly
timed godsend for me. Thank you.
