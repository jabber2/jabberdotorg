<PRE>I've wanted to add a good layer of security to Jabber, but unfortunately I
have little experience in this area(encryption, etc) to do anything
myself.  What i have done though, is try to design this sucker in a way
that would be easy to add security to.

There are three things that could be added that I can think of offhand...
first is one that doesn't involve the server at all, just use PGP within
the messages and let the clients handle the encryption/decryption, the
server just passes it around.  This is good, because simple clients can
still be written that don't have to worry about it, and secure clients can
be used where the extra security is needed.

The second would be to simply tunnel the connections between the client
and server through ssh or something similiar... 

And thirdly, Jabber already does simple authentication like any other net
service(POP, HTTP, FTP, etc) so that you only have access to your account,
but an extra chunk here to do it better would be some sort of public key
exchange like SSL does, within the initial authentication, again, I don't
know a heck of lot about this stuff :)

But, overall, I want to make security as available as possible, but if it
requires heavier clients even if they don't use/need the security, I'm not
sure I want to force that... but it should be available to users that want
it, from the first release if possible.
