<PRE>
&gt;<i> Anonymous users are a good idea, as long as they are identified as such,
</I>&gt;<i> but deciding that we don't need any security apart from client-client
</I>&gt;<i> and a simple textual password is a rather limited vision I think.
</I>&gt;<i> The framework for building a secure system must be there, even if
</I>&gt;<i> many transports are not secure.
</I>
With the way it works right now, I think the framework is already there to
overlay security w/o really changing the functionality underneath... but
if it can be added w/o overcomplicating things or limiting functionality,
I'm all for it!

&gt;<i> For example, we could assign transport security levels, ranging from
</I>&gt;<i> fully authenticated and encrypted, through encrypted authentication
</I>&gt;<i> but plaintext transmitted, to plaintext authenticated, and
</I>&gt;<i> finally unauthenticated.
</I>&gt;<i> A server should alter the security level of a message based on the
</I>&gt;<i> authentication level and its trust of the transmitting client or server.
</I>
Wouldn't that require integrating some sort of encryption/decryption
engine everywhere?  Since things can be plugged in anywhere and
transported/relayed through various processes, the &quot;secure&quot; transport will
have to pass through many &quot;insecure&quot; layers before reaching a &quot;secure&quot;
Jabber transport or client... 

There is no reason that a &quot;secure&quot; server couldn't be written that uses
encryption everywhere, for all securly connected users and trusted
transports...  this would actually be a very good thing for those that
want the best in security! 

&gt;<i> At the very least I want to make it very hard for people to pretend
</I>&gt;<i> to be me without having to go the public/private key path. This
</I>&gt;<i> includes faking presence.
</I>
I honestly don't see how that is possible in any way w/o a public/private
key structure.  Sure, there are a good deal of things that can be done to
make it very difficult to do this, but ultimately the only thing I know of
that will guarantee this is keys.

&gt;<i> This is a good point.  I have a system which progessively gives a user
</I>&gt;<i> worse performance if they abuse the system. A good principle is to have
</I>&gt;<i> a user's performance behave twice as bad than if everybody was doing the
</I>&gt;<i> same as they were. I do this by introducing artificial delays to responses
</I>&gt;<i> once their &quot;load average&quot; reaches a certain level.
</I>
Hmm... I like this idea... the more you abuse, the less you use :)

To be honest, I'll be quite happy when Jabber attains the popularity where
&quot;abuse&quot; issues become a problem.  Anonymous users are identified by the
scoket they are using, and the server can be programmed with reasonable
restriction to help curb abuse when it starts becoming a problem(or before
when we can better identify the ways this can happen and it's under
heavier use/testing by us).
