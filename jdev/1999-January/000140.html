You took the words out of my mouth.  I was just about to post &quot;I

on further reflection...&quot; grin

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, I think everyone can be happy!  Here is an idea for server

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have these moduler transparts, including an ICQ transport.  When an
</I>&gt;<i> account is added to a Jabber server, it would be really really nice if a
</I>&gt;<i> list of transports could be specified for that user.  That way I could run
</I>&gt;<i> a server, and the default ICQ transport creates an ICQ number if it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't already have one and you send something to ICQ.
</I>
  Welcome to jabber.server.org!
  Available transports: Jabber AIM ICQ SMTP IRC...
    Do you wish to use the ICQ transport? y
    Do you have an ICQ account? n
    Would you like the ICQ transport to establish one for you now? y
    Do you want the ICQ transport to generate a password? n
    Please enter a new password for this account:
    Reenter password:
     * contacting ICQ transport
     * ICQ transport replies: You are 'userdude' with a UIN of '8321110'

    Do you wish to use the SMTP transport?

&gt;<i> But there is also
</I>&gt;<i> another ICQ server, which my jabber account is configured to use, which
</I>&gt;<i> will never, ever, create an ICQ number.
</I>
Do you mean 'another ICQ transport'?

&gt;<i> Maybe it is the same ICQ Transport but it has some kind of config
</I>&gt;<i> information for each user?  But I think it would also be interesting or
</I>&gt;<i> nice if I could tell the server to never route me to or from some
</I>&gt;<i> transports.  This would be useful in a lot of cases.  If I wanted to use
</I>&gt;<i> an ICQ transport that was so divergent from another one that it couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be just configuration options, but the other one was what everyone else
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to use, and we wanted to use the same server, it would be no
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  Another scenario would be if I had some prejudice against
</I>&gt;<i> another IM system, and didn't want my messages going across it, even by
</I>&gt;<i> accident (perhaps because of percieved security issues or whatever).
</I>
I'm not understanding this other transport.  Does it have a single
UIN for its own purposes, to query the ICQ server about ICQ accounts?
Perhaps to send anonymous messages?

&gt;<i> Agh, this is getting too long.  Sorry for ranting.
</I>
There isn't enough ranting on this list yet. :)
