Anonymous users are a good idea, as long as they are identified as such,
but deciding that we don't need any security apart from client-client
and a simple textual password is a rather limited vision I think.
The framework for building a secure system must be there, even if
many transports are not secure.

For example, we could assign transport security levels, ranging from
fully authenticated and encrypted, through encrypted authentication
but plaintext transmitted, to plaintext authenticated, and
finally unauthenticated.
A server should alter the security level of a message based on the
authentication level and its trust of the transmitting client or server.

This gives the receiver some control over who they receive messages
from, together with some information on how trustworthy a message is.

At the very least I want to make it very hard for people to pretend
to be me without having to go the public/private key path. This
includes faking presence.

client-client encryption is a good thing - it prevents those nasty
jabber admin people from peeking at conversations.
 
&gt;<i> otherwise, making Jabber, the server and protocol, secure in any way w/o
</I>&gt;<i> that encryption is essentially impossible or will be very limiting in the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality and adaptability of the system.

</I>
These systems can be identified as insecure. Something like SMTP's
Apparently-From: (which works!).

This is a good point.  I have a system which progessively gives a user
worse performance if they abuse the system. A good principle is to have
a user's performance behave twice as bad than if everybody was doing the
same as they were. I do this by introducing artificial delays to responses
once their &quot;load average&quot; reaches a certain level.

Anonymous users make doing this tricky, since you can't necessarily identify
if it's an individual abusing the system or a group doing normal stuff,
but I'm sure you could find a reasonable solution. [Maybe just - if you
use a real client it will be much faster ;]
