<PRE>Hey all!

&gt;<i>One of the differences with other IM systems that a Jabber client can take
</I>&gt;<i>advantage of, is the fact that Jabber allows users to have multiple
</I>&gt;<i>sessions simultaneously
</I>
hmm.. ok.. I wasn't very sure how this could be accomplished while allowing
for a &quot;plug-in&quot; client type of thing. As far as the Preferences section is,
I'm making it all look like Winamp in how it allows each plug-in to be
configured quite easily. For the main client window it is a bit different..
anyway.. while I was typing this up I thought up a way to do it, and have
modified the menus to reflect it. A bunch of new screenshots are up at my
site now so you can see the menus and everything. (I went and downloaded a
nice program for that make screenshot making a ton easier.)

&gt;<i>so each of the users in the display might have
</I>&gt;<i>another branch underneath them showing their current online sessions...
</I>
Good point.. I've added that and it looks a lot neater too :)

&gt;<i>There's also the possibility of having different named customizable groups
</I>&gt;<i>in which users are sorted, you might have &quot;Work&quot; or &quot;Gamers&quot; or &quot;Friends&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>etc... and special ones like &quot;Online&quot;.
</I>
Right.. I've already taken care of that. The VIEW menu allows you to switch
between Group View (AIM style), Online/Offline (ICQ style) and Client view
(sorted by client types). The new screenshots allow you to see that now.

&gt;<i>Looking good so far though!
</I>
I'm having fun! I like this GUI making stuff! Now if I could only code....
