Definitely.

Not bad, I don't think we can avoid polling remote servers when a user
comes online.

&gt;<i> her watch on Bob alive. There could also be a reasonable maximum

How about this. Each user has a roster of people she watches ([watch]) and
people who watch her ([watchers]). A status request to a remote server may
optionally include a request to be added to [watchers]. All status changes
would be reported to the [watchers], preferably by sending a single message
to each server within [watchers] (rather than each separate client - the
remote server could send it to each client).

This way a user knows who is watching and potentially has some control over
this. For example, a server may be setup so that requests to be added to
[watchers] get added to [pending-watchers] to be approved by the user, who
may approve them or add them to [disapproved-watchers] or [discard-users].
([discard-users] might be a roster containing users we never want to hear
from).

We now have a distributed database synchonisation problem - what if the
remote system is unavailable (or too slow) when a change is made. When a
server receives a status change for a user who is no longer interested
(ie has removed the watchee from [watch]) then it should return a message
to be removed from [watchers].
