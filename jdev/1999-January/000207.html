<PRE>I haven't actually written an application using Expat but have looked into it.
It works differently than the Java parsers I am familiar with. You have to
feed Expat chunks of data to parse. The parse function takes a boolean
parameter called isFinal that you set to true when you pass the final chunk of
the document. I think that's exactly what we need. It's actually a lot more
intuitive (from my point of view) than the SAX interfaces I have been using in
Java.

I'm looking foward to the status update tonight. I'd love to offer help in
whatever area needs it. See you then.

</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;j&gt;&lt;/j&gt; tags and extracts that packet, then hands it off to a general
</I>&gt;<i> handler routine which THEN passes that data to a (custom written) XML
</I>&gt;<i> parser, so the parser is just getting the data with one root element like
</I>&gt;<i> it expects....  So really, the protocol was adapted to make writing the
</I>&gt;<i> server easier at the time I started writing it.  And if you take the
</I>&gt;<i> approach to have a small handler roll around with the incoming data and
</I>&gt;<i> extract &quot;packets&quot; and hand them to the XML parser as it gets them, it
</I>&gt;<i> works quite well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;right&quot; way to do it would be to just have the IO loop constantly
</I>&gt;<i> streaming data in chunks to an XML parser and change the protocol to look
</I>&gt;<i> more like a real XML document. I'd like to use expat to do this, but I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't looked into it enough yet to determine how it can deal with
</I>&gt;<i> incoming &quot;chunks&quot; of data...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I haven't taken this step at any point yet is because it would
</I>&gt;<i> end up being an almost complete server rewrite, and although I'd REALLY
</I>&gt;<i> like to do that and do many things differenty/right, I just haven't had
</I>&gt;<i> enough TIME :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To summarize, what we currently have &quot;works&quot; but could stand for a good
</I>&gt;<i> deal of improvement.  I announced/launched what I had in the state that it
</I>&gt;<i> is earlier this month so that I could hopefully find some help in doing
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;improvement&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;NOTE&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to do my best to write up a BIG STATUS UPDATE tonight
</I>&gt;<i> with all kinds of ideas and stuff on everything, from the server to the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol to the web site/docs and more...  hopefully help to bring
</I>&gt;<i> everyone to the same page and we can go from there

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi, I have another protocol related suggestion. I've been experimenting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a Java client and have been using several of the major XML parsers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to test it out. Apparently, a well-formed XML document needs to have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; single root element. Much like the root &lt;html&gt;&lt;!-- everything else goes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here --&gt;&lt;/html&gt; element in HTML. All of the parsers I've tried so far,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stopped parsing at the second &lt;j&gt; element. There are several ugly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workarounds but I think it would be much more conducive to our goals if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we could take any off the shelf XML parser and not have to modify it in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; order to write a Jabber client. So, I propose that both the server and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client wrap all their messages in a root &lt;jabber&gt;&lt;/jabber&gt; element.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Attributes could be used to specify the client and protocol much like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the current &lt;j type='connection'&gt; element. Maybe something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;jabber agent='Jabzilla v1.0' protocol='19990121'&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;j type='login'&gt;&lt;user&gt;foo&lt;/user&gt;&lt;pass&gt;bar&lt;/pass&gt;&lt;/j&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;!-- etc. --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/jabber&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The end &lt;/jabber&gt; element could be used to indicate that the server or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client is getting ready to close the connection. Comments? I'm in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process of downloading Cygwin32 so that I can make the necessary changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the server to test it out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just out of curiosity, why are all the messages between client and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server wrapped in a &lt;j type='foo'&gt; element? Why not &lt;login&gt; or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;message&gt;? If we used element names rather than attribute types to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distinguish the purpose of a message, we could create a DTD specifying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what elements are allowed to be nested in others. For example, &lt;user&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and &lt;pass&gt; would only be allowed in a &lt;login&gt; element. I'm not proposing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that we validate the XML as it comes in from the server, but it could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used as a specification. Much like EBNF is for more traditional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols. And who knows, maybe while implementing and debugging our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clients we could have it validate the XML as an aid to determine a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source of errors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Bye,
