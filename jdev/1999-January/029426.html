I think this is much more complicated than is currently intended.  I
currently use ICQ but I want to move to Jabber.  it is VITAL to me that
people receiving messages from me see them come from ME and not some
jabber transport.

So, I start Jabber, where I am <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">coatl at my.server.org.</A>  In my login packet, I
configure my Jabber client to also send my ICQ number and password.  My
server has been configured with an ICQ transport.  This transport logs
into ICQ using my number and password.  If I send a message to an ICQ
address the above transport simply forwards it on my behalf,
transparently, so from ICQ's point of view, it came from my ICQ number,
but there was no code in my client for this.  My client just sent a jabber
message.  The transport forwarded for me.  Later my ICQ buddies send me a
message to my ICQ nick.  Because the servers transport is logged in as me,
it gets my message.  It then bundles up the message to look like a Jabber
message, and sends it back to my client.  My client sees a jabber message.

So in short, to talk to ICQ users, you yourself need an ICQ number.
However, you do NOT need to have an ICQ client, and the Jabber client
doesn't need to know ANYTHING about ICQ, at all.
