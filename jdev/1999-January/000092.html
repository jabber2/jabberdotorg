Me too... I have a similar tool to jabber, goofey, which is also fairly
server-centric (actually, much more so) and am investigating whether to
build a goofey transport for jabber and migrate users over. 
[see <A HREF="http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/~tym/goofey.html">http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/~tym/goofey.html</A> ]

Anyway, having written and run goofey for almost 9 years with 1500
or so active users (mostly at Monash University in Australia) I have
seen a lot of these type of issues so hopefully I'll be able to provide
a useful perspective.

&gt;<i> I have seen the discussion about multiple clients and how message are
</I>&gt;<i> handled when they are sent to someone that is connected from multiple
</I>&gt;<i> places. How about something similar to IMAP? Basically, if I am connected
</I>&gt;<i> from 3 different clients, and I recieve a message, all three clients are

I agree that it should be sent to all clients, unless the user requests
otherwise. Goofey has the concept of a &quot;designated client&quot; which is
the client to which messages are sent, if there is no designated client
then messages go to all of a user's clients.

We also have a &quot;quiet&quot; concept. A quiet user will have all messages
kept unread on the server but still be &quot;present&quot;. When a designated
client dies the user is automatically switched to quiet.

&gt;<i> One more thing, I know there is talk about some kind of SMTP interface.
</I>&gt;<i> What exactly is the idea behind this? What should it acclomplish? The
</I>&gt;<i> ability to send an email to an address and have it delivered to the
</I>&gt;<i> person's jabber client? If someone could please explain this it would be
</I>&gt;<i> great. I may even try to get something working. 
</I>
jabber -&gt; SMTP would be useful. If I was not going to have jabber access
but still had email, forwarding jabber messages would be useful. In goofey
only a limited number of unread messages are kept for a limited time before
being automatically forwarded to the users email address.
