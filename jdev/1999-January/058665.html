<PRE>Hey all,

First of all, I just want to say that I have been watching the list for a
few days and I am very interested in helping out with jabber. It is a cool
idea. 

I have seen the discussion about multiple clients and how message are
handled when they are sent to someone that is connected from multiple
places. How about something similar to IMAP? Basically, if I am connected
from 3 different clients, and I recieve a message, all three clients are
notified about it. At that point, the message could either be sent
entirely to each of the clients, what I think is better, it could simply
be left on the server waiting to be retrieved by any of the clients. Once
it is read on any of the clients(or maybe once it is specifically deleted)
it would be erased off the server or all the clients would be told it was
read. Obviously there are details in this scheme that need to be worked
out, but I don't see a problem with it? Am I missing something obvious(or 
not so obvious)? 

One more thing, I know there is talk about some kind of SMTP interface.
What exactly is the idea behind this? What should it acclomplish? The
ability to send an email to an address and have it delivered to the
person's jabber client? If someone could please explain this it would be
great. I may even try to get something working. 

Thanks,
Jeff
