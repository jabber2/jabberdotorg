<PRE>
I just want to point out/emphasize that the description Dan wrote up here
is excellent and right on target!  Somehow we'll have to start getting
some of this good content up on the web site. 

&gt;<i> Let me expand on that:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Say Alice and Bob both have ICQ accounts, and are on eachother's ICQ buddy
</I>&gt;<i> lists. Alice switches to Jabber (and her server supports ICQ). Alice stops
</I>&gt;<i> using her ICQ client. When Alice logs into Jabber, her jabber server logs
</I>&gt;<i> into ICQ on her behalf.  When Alice (using jabber) sends a message to Bob,
</I>&gt;<i> her server sends an ICQ message from her ICQ account. Alice is using ICQ
</I>&gt;<i> via remote-control! Bob won't ever suspect that Alice has switched to
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jake, another jabber user, doesn't have and ICQ account or an ICQ-enabled
</I>&gt;<i> server. Jake can now talk to Alice via jabber, but he can't talk to Bob.
</I>&gt;<i> Jake doesn't care, since he's lived his life up to this point without
</I>&gt;<i> getting an ICQ account. ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Later, Bob gets Jabber (on an ICQ-enabled server). When Bob logs into
</I>&gt;<i> jabber, his server logs into ICQ on his behalf. Bob can still see Alice
</I>&gt;<i> thru ICQ, and they can send messages back and forth. Alice and Bob see
</I>&gt;<i> eachother on their jabber buddies list, even though it's really their ICQ
</I>&gt;<i> buddies list. Alice and Bob can go on like this forever without realizing
</I>&gt;<i> they both have jabber. When Alice sends a message, it goes like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alice client --&gt; Alice's jabber server -&gt; ICQ transport --&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> ICQ servers --&gt; ICQ transport -&gt; Bob's jabber server --&gt; Bob's client
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, Bob and Alice could be on the SAME jabber server, and still not
</I>&gt;<i> know it. Sure it's inefficient, but I don't see any way to detect jabber on
</I>&gt;<i> either end without being intrusive. (&quot;This message brought to you by
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber(TM), the new XML-enabled personal messaging protocol for good little
</I>&gt;<i> boys and girls!&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Later, Alice mentions her jabber address, and Bob adds her as a jabber
</I>&gt;<i> buddy. Whenever Alice logs in, two entries appear on Bob's list: One for
</I>&gt;<i> jabber, and one for ICQ. Bob knows it's the same person so he takes Alice
</I>&gt;<i> off his ICQ Buddy list. Problem solved. Alice has to do the same thing too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [Side note: we could write lots of code to try and detect this, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think it's needed. Besides, mabye Bob doesn't know that his friend
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">Alice at alice.org</A> is the same person as his friend &quot;DarkAvenger&quot; on ICQ. Why
</I>&gt;<i> spoil it? ]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's how it should work. Here's my implementation thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Adding/removing buddies from the ICQ list should be do-able from the
</I>&gt;<i> client, as normal jabber add/removes. The client must have *NO* code to
</I>&gt;<i> support ICQ, and the transport must do all the work of translation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Rosters are stored at the server, since I don't want to re-type my buddy
</I>&gt;<i> list if I borrow a random computer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Jake (who doesn't have ICQ) can't talk to ICQ users. Before he got
</I>&gt;<i> jabber, he didn't have an ICQ account. Why should he &quot;suddenly&quot; want one
</I>&gt;<i> now? Let's face it: Jake doesn't care about ICQ users. Or AIM users. He
</I>&gt;<i> uses jabber because his friends are reachable thru jabber. [ Therefore, the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ICQ account creation&quot; feature of the ICQ transport is not important enough
</I>&gt;<i> for Version 1.0. It could always be added later. In the mean time, people
</I>&gt;<i> could get their ICQ account the old-fashioned way :]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Identity strings between client and server will probably be &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">123412 at ICQ</A>&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't like that. Imagine Alice giving Bob's ICQ number to Jake. Jake
</I>&gt;<i> types &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">123412 at ICQ</A>&quot; but his server doesn't have an ICQ transport. His server
</I>&gt;<i> will assume that ICQ is another server and try to contact it. Even if a
</I>&gt;<i> computer named 'icq' doesn't exist, Jake's server is confused. Yuck. IMHO,
</I>&gt;<i> there should be some special way to identify transports vs. computer names.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like requiring a period in the server name because there are many
</I>&gt;<i> intranets (and Micro$oft networks) without name servers or connections to
</I>&gt;<i> the internet. All computers are known on a first-name only basis. Maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> slash (123/ICQ) or a pound-sign (123#ICQ) or combo (1234@#ICQ) ???
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Handling multiple ICQ accounts is going to be tricky. If alice has 2 ICQ
</I>&gt;<i> accounts (one for DarkAvenger and one for Alice), and she sends a message
</I>&gt;<i> to a random ICQ user, how does she specify which ICQ account to send out
</I>&gt;<i> on? If the user is on her buddy list, she can indicate her preference once,
</I>&gt;<i> and everything will be cool. There is still the question of how to name the
</I>&gt;<i> transports: &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">1234 at ICQ.DarkAvenger</A>&quot; ? ? ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [ The client/server division would suggest that the prefrences be stored on
</I>&gt;<i> the server, so the client only sends it to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">1234 at ICQ</A>, and the server figures
</I>&gt;<i> it out. But if the server doesn't know your prefrences for a particular
</I>&gt;<i> user, then how would it ask the client for the new prefrence? Shesh, this
</I>&gt;<i> is giving me a headache. ]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Billy (who only has ICQ) can only message jabber users who have ICQ
</I>&gt;<i> accounts. But he doesn't know them as 'jabber users', only ICQ users. Billy
</I>&gt;<i> cannot talk to Jake and vice-versa. They couldn't before jabber, but we're
</I>&gt;<i> not here to solve the world's problems. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Everything I said for ICQ also applies to: e-mail, 2-way pagers, PGPJabber,
</I>&gt;<i> AIM, and smoke signals. None of these protocols should appear anywhere in
</I>&gt;<i> the client source code. (well, except encryption). The point is to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to add these protocols (on the fly) at the server ONLY. As far as the
</I>&gt;<i> client is concerned, roster names are just arbitrary strings that the
</I>&gt;<i> server makes up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -=Dan=-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I like the &quot;conversation&quot; idea for configuring jabber transports ;)
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't think it has enough 'navagation ability'. What if the user
</I>&gt;<i> wants to start over? what if they want to skip a section that they've
</I>&gt;<i> already configured?  At least with touch-tones, you've got the # and *
</I>&gt;<i> keys.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.P.S. Brainstorming new jabber transports (or client features)
</I>&gt;<i> - WinPopup messages (M$ networking) - Totally do-able via Samba.
</I>&gt;<i> - IVR (Computer calls you up and reads your message.)
</I>&gt;<i> - WinAmp messages (dmag is now playing &quot;CJ Bolland - Sugar is Sweeter&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> - X10 - remote control lights and stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> - Web 'presence' support (see who's on a web page..). Modify NetScrape to
</I>&gt;<i> send http header &quot;X-Jabber: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">alice at alice.org</A>&quot;, and server will add an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;X-Jabber&quot; header with a list of jabber users to who recently visited that
</I>&gt;<i> page. It could work ;).
</I>&gt;<i>
