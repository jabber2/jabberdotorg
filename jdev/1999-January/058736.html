<PRE>I don't have time to answer this in detail, but the way it's currently
done is what you hit on at the bottom.  Since in Jabber your &quot;roster&quot;
lives on the server side, when you change status only the people in your
roster that are also online will recieve your status updates.  Of course,
this will be completly customizable from within a module :)  

Actually, things are quite a bit more complex than this and deserving of
their own run-on letter... but I'm all outa breath tonight, so I'll push
this on my FIFO stack and it should happen soon if it doesn't get buried.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, it can be done two ways. First, I could keep a
</I>&gt;<i> list of all the users I want to be notified that I'm online. When I
</I>&gt;<i> connect, I'll send all of those users a status message saying I'm
</I>&gt;<i> available. This seems to be the simplest but less intuitive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second would require that the other users add my to the list of
</I>&gt;<i> users they'd like to monitor. Since I don't know who's added me to their
</I>&gt;<i> list, when I connect it's up to them to query my server to get the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary info.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A combination of the two could also be implemented. When a user adds me
</I>&gt;<i> to their roster, they could inform my server that they'd like to be
</I>&gt;<i> notified of any changes in my status. This way, I don't specifically
</I>&gt;<i> have to know who adds me to their roster. But it complicates things for
</I>&gt;<i> the server. It would have to keep a list of users to notify whenever my
</I>&gt;<i> status changed. If I'm popular, this could be a rather large list.
</I>&gt;<i> Quotas could be used to limit the amount of resources each user is
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to allocate. But that complicates things more than I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> them. One advantage to doing this is that I could possibly query my
</I>&gt;<i> server for the list of users who've taken an interest in me and
</I>&gt;<i> selectively remove people from the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there other ways to do this and what is planned for Jabber? How does
</I>&gt;<i> ICQ and AIM do it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
