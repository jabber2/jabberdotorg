</I>&gt;<i> Jabber(TM), the new XML-enabled personal messaging protocol for good little
</I>&gt;<i> boys and girls!&quot;)
</I>that message is cool, let's use it! :P
(the non-jabber-transports can add this message (or a random message,
just like BitchX) at the end -- optional feature -- disabled by default)

&gt;<i> Later, Alice mentions her jabber address, and Bob adds her as a jabber
</I>&gt;<i> buddy. Whenever Alice logs in, two entries appear on Bob's list: One for
</I>&gt;<i> jabber, and one for ICQ. Bob knows it's the same person so he takes Alice
</I>&gt;<i> off his ICQ Buddy list. Problem solved. Alice has to do the same thing too.
</I>(i love those alice/bob/jake/billy characters!)

&gt;<i> [Side note: we could write lots of code to try and detect this, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think it's needed. Besides, mabye Bob doesn't know that his friend
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">Alice at alice.org</A> is the same person as his friend &quot;DarkAvenger&quot; on ICQ. Why
</I>&gt;<i> spoil it? ]
</I>right.


&gt;<i> - Adding/removing buddies from the ICQ list should be do-able from the
</I>&gt;<i> client, as normal jabber add/removes. The client must have *NO* code to
</I>&gt;<i> support ICQ, and the transport must do all the work of translation.
</I>yes.

&gt;<i> - Rosters are stored at the server, since I don't want to re-type my buddy
</I>&gt;<i> list if I borrow a random computer.
</I>yes. :)

&gt;<i> - Jake (who doesn't have ICQ) can't talk to ICQ users. Before he got
</I>&gt;<i> jabber, he didn't have an ICQ account. Why should he &quot;suddenly&quot; want one
</I>&gt;<i> now? Let's face it: Jake doesn't care about ICQ users. Or AIM users. He
</I>&gt;<i> uses jabber because his friends are reachable thru jabber. [ Therefore, the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ICQ account creation&quot; feature of the ICQ transport is not important enough
</I>&gt;<i> for Version 1.0. It could always be added later. In the mean time, people
</I>&gt;<i> could get their ICQ account the old-fashioned way :]
</I>i agree. 

&gt;<i> there should be some special way to identify transports vs. computer names.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like requiring a period in the server name because there are many
</I>&gt;<i> intranets (and Micro$oft networks) without name servers or connections to
</I>&gt;<i> the internet. All computers are known on a first-name only basis. Maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> slash (123/ICQ) or a pound-sign (123#ICQ) or combo (1234@#ICQ) ???
</I>you're right, we have to implement a special notation.

[SSG's <A HREF="icq://,">icq://,</A> jab:// idea is good, but we have to standardize it.
(w3.org?) anyways, only mirabilis can register that icq:// prefix, etc. so
this can be applied for only jab:// thing]

maybe something like info1:info2:info3:info4:info999#TRANSPORT thing?

&gt;<i> Everything I said for ICQ also applies to: e-mail, 2-way pagers, PGPJabber,
</I>&gt;<i> AIM, and smoke signals. None of these protocols should appear anywhere in
</I>&gt;<i> the client source code. (well, except encryption). The point is to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to add these protocols (on the fly) at the server ONLY. As far as the
</I>&gt;<i> client is concerned, roster names are just arbitrary strings that the
</I>&gt;<i> server makes up.
</I>yes. and i have to implement a expandable C structure for my client :P

&gt;<i> P.S. I like the &quot;conversation&quot; idea for configuring jabber transports ;)
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't think it has enough 'navagation ability'. What if the user
</I>&gt;<i> wants to start over? what if they want to skip a section that they've
</I>&gt;<i> already configured?  At least with touch-tones, you've got the # and *
</I>&gt;<i> keys.
</I>well, in touch-tones you have 2 bits. here we have an XML thing. :)

&gt;<i> P.P.S. Brainstorming new jabber transports (or client features)
</I>&gt;<i> - WinPopup messages (M$ networking) - Totally do-able via Samba.
</I>&gt;<i> - IVR (Computer calls you up and reads your message.)
</I>&gt;<i> - WinAmp messages (dmag is now playing &quot;CJ Bolland - Sugar is Sweeter&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> - X10 - remote control lights and stuff.
</I>brilliant!

&gt;<i> - Web 'presence' support (see who's on a web page..). Modify NetScrape to
</I>&gt;<i> send http header &quot;X-Jabber: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">alice at alice.org</A>&quot;, and server will add an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;X-Jabber&quot; header with a list of jabber users to who recently visited that
</I>&gt;<i> page. It could work ;).
</I>modify the HTTP?


here's a bunch of ideas from me:
 - SMS (The Computer leaves you a Short-Message in your GSM, telling your
        messages. But short-message-service accepts short messages ;) )
 - Pager (The Computer sends you a message on your pager)
 - Forwarding (you can forward your messages to other Jabber[not
               needed]/ICQ/AIM user)
 - Fax (The Computer sends the phone number XXX a fax, via the
        anonymous-and-free fax services (has interval - you receive max. 1
        fax for every N min))


bye,
 disqk
