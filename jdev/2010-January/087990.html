I think A is entirely practical. At minimum, I think you could use  
MIME-style encoding on the node, enclose that in quotes, and then ACE  
encode the domain. That loses resources, but I don't think that's a  
worry, given that you can also include that data in the original  
stanza.

Of course, if you do want a full SMTP/XMPP gateway, then you do need  
resources as well, and you probably need to have the gateway domain  
as the email address's domain, and the full jid (encoded and quoted)  
as the local-part. FWIW, I don't think that this is as interesting a  
problem as rich archival access.

&gt;<i> &gt; - Should I add X- header for preserving XMPP 'from' field? What  
</I>&gt;<i> exact?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What about the Jabber-ID header? If I understood it correctly, it

</I>&gt;<i> to be exactly its role: indicating a way to contact the sender of an
</I>&gt;<i> email via XMPP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>That's a good point. The problem is that it's just a header - there's  
little searching capability, and it won't appear nicely in the  
ENVELOPE fetch item.

&gt;<i> In any case, I don't think you should include any random data of  
</I>&gt;<i> data
</I>&gt;<i> that is unique to the IMAP store: if the user happens to use various

</I>&gt;<i> as deterministic as possible.
</I>
I don't see why consistency between implementations helps here. It's  
not as if we need that for email now, after all - different  
submission agents add message identifiers in all manner of ways, and  
certainly not consistently.

All that matters is that a given message has an identifier, which is  
(mostly) unique. (Message ids aren't entirely unique, and this  
doesn't hurt anyone).

If the intent is to reply to a message held in one IMAP store through  
an unassociated Submission server acting as a gateway and have it all  
work perfectly, then I'd have to raise the If It Hurts defense. :-)

Dave.
