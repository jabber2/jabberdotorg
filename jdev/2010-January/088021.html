<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi Karsten,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am studying at a University in Germany. We started a little project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which tracks the location of people, connects them and helps them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interact on different levels. Well, in the end it will.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We decided to use XMPP as our protocol and as it turns out there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> almost always an XEP which covers something we want to do. I really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start liking it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since we don't have the capacity to write our own server we decide to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use an existing one and enhance its features with an external
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> component. However, I kinda ran into a problem and I hope you can help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me out. In the XEP-0114 it says that an external component can do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things that clients cannot. I tried to find a list of those things but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> till now I wasn't lucky.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've ran into a similar use case myself. &#160; External components don't
</I>&gt;<i> have that kind of access. &#160;An external component basically registers
</I>&gt;<i> itself as component.domain.com, and can send and receive messages
</I>&gt;<i> from/to all JIDs at that domain (i.e. <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user1 at component.domain.com</A>,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user2 at component.domain.com</A>, component.domain.com, etc.). &#160;But the xmpp
</I>&gt;<i> server will not route stanzas that are not addressed to the component to
</I>&gt;<i> it, nor will the server allow the component to send stanzas addressed
</I>&gt;<i> from other domains.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is one special thing my component needs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be able to do. I would like my component to listen to buddy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requests and &quot;buddy acceptances&quot; of clients which are received by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server. As far as I know an internal component &#160;or something like a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packet interceptor as a plug in which sends the packets on to my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> component could do that. However, before I start writing a plug in for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a specific server implementation I would like to know if there is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way within the specifications of the protocol.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We wrote a plugin for openfire that just forwards stanzas down an XML
</I>&gt;<i> pipe over TCP, and use an external (non-XMPP) service to filter out the
</I>&gt;<i> stanzas we are interested in using xpath expressions (this was really
</I>&gt;<i> easy with twisted words/wokkel).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, you can implement the logic completely inside your plugin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think you'll be able to pass stanzas from a plugin or internal
</I>&gt;<i> component to an external component directly, the component protocol
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't support that. &#160;If you really want to use an external XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> component, I can only think of wrapping your original stanza in another
</I>&gt;<i> stanza addressed to the component.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck,
</I>&gt;<i> Ilya
</I>
Thx a lot for your advice. We decide to send extra messages to the
component once the buddy request was accepted. This is not an ideal
solution Hwever your implementation is &quot;just&quot; a proof of concept right
now.

best wishes,
Karsten Jeschkies
