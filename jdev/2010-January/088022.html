<PRE>Hello,

I'm trying to make a qeue and user/message controller to my server
users (attendants) interactions with anonymous ones (users). I was
thinking on implementing a controller client (kind of &quot;know everybody
bot&quot;) that handle the qeues and chat redirections but I read about
whack and external components to openfire and now I want to know how
to do that control directly from a server component (which will
probably end the problem the client launching and perhaps even the
client life/death/memory leak problems that eventually show up).

I was wandering on the ignite pages for whack documentation and some
tutorial for dummies to get started on whack developing but I could
not find it. Someone know any? Any help will be really big!
