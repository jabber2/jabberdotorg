</I>&gt;<i> till now I wasn't lucky. 
</I>
I've ran into a similar use case myself.   External components don't 
have that kind of access.  An external component basically registers 
itself as component.domain.com, and can send and receive messages 
from/to all JIDs at that domain (i.e. <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user1 at component.domain.com</A>, 
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user2 at component.domain.com</A>, component.domain.com, etc.).  But the xmpp 
server will not route stanzas that are not addressed to the component to 
it, nor will the server allow the component to send stanzas addressed 
from other domains.

&gt;<i> There is one special thing my component needs
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to do. I would like my component to listen to buddy
</I>&gt;<i> requests and &quot;buddy acceptances&quot; of clients which are received by the
</I>&gt;<i> server. As far as I know an internal component  or something like a
</I>&gt;<i> packet interceptor as a plug in which sends the packets on to my
</I>&gt;<i> component could do that. However, before I start writing a plug in for
</I>&gt;<i> a specific server implementation I would like to know if there is a
</I>&gt;<i> way within the specifications of the protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
We wrote a plugin for openfire that just forwards stanzas down an XML 
pipe over TCP, and use an external (non-XMPP) service to filter out the 
stanzas we are interested in using xpath expressions (this was really 
easy with twisted words/wokkel).

Alternatively, you can implement the logic completely inside your plugin. 

I don't think you'll be able to pass stanzas from a plugin or internal 
component to an external component directly, the component protocol 
doesn't support that.  If you really want to use an external XMPP 
component, I can only think of wrapping your original stanza in another 
stanza addressed to the component.

Good luck,
Ilya

&gt;<i> I need this feature to do some logic on the component side.

</I>&gt;<i> I hope you understand my problem and thank you for any advices.
