<PRE>the online games idea:

yes, i agree with you, mr sietsma. i had been thinking a online game 
appliocation using jabber for communication would be excellent. i doubt 
there would be able to be any one spec or applicattion that could 
provide a framework for all or even most types of simple interactive 
games, but jabber spec should provide a new tag (other than having to 
use message), better yet, a new type of message (&quot;interface&quot; or 
something like that for example.). such a new feature would act as a 
'namespace', to allow third parties to insert their own specs and 
interfaces into a jabber message.

the first thing i guess would be to allow forms in a jabber message. 
that would take a huge step towards it, and may even provide that 
universal framework. if a game manager could set up a set of 'jabber 
forms' templates to send out as messages in a jabber message, the gamers 
could use it to reply to their game moves, actions, etc. the forms 
values could then be processed either manually by the moderator, or 
automatically by a game server.

i was thinking of something similar b/c i have out on my list of &quot;1 to 2 
year future plans&quot; list a system that ran on jabber to run detailed, 
multi-player &quot;risk/axis and allies&quot; style games.

i would like to work with anyone else on this project, but i would not 
be able to start any time soon, since i have way too many things on my 
plate as it is. if anyone wants to help me work on this jabber games 
project, you will first have to help me on my other projects  :)

i am trying to start up a couple of mailing lists, and promoting them is 
taking up a good chunk of my time. one is the Theoretic Bazaar 
(<A HREF="http://www.theoretic.com/bazaar">http://www.theoretic.com/bazaar</A>), a mailing list to help educate 
&quot;newbies&quot; to open source software. it is mostly intended for end users 
(*individuals and businesses alike), but also is open to developers, as 
long as they have some questions about open source in general and want 
to know how it can benefit them. the other is Theoretic Cauldron 
(<A HREF="http://www.theoretic.com/cauldron">http://www.theoretic.com/cauldron</A>), a mailing list to explore ways for 
developers of open source to prosper off of their work.

i also have two time related utility programs, both in Perl, and use XML 
(two of my favorite computer languages). one is an alarm clock program 
(<A HREF="http://www.theoretic.com/alarm">http://www.theoretic.com/alarm</A>), which i have big plans for, and wose 
ideas i have for it will take it quite beyond what it is now. and also a 
timer/stopwatch program (<A HREF="http://www.theoretic.com/timer">http://www.theoretic.com/timer</A>) which basically 
counts up or down from a set time. yeah, a stop watch/egg timer program  
:<i>). both of them are simple at the moment, but i have grand plans and 
</I>ideas for them. i just need the time to impliment the ideas. i am 
looking for someone to take the projects over, and maybe also work on a 
'schedule' program i've had ideas for. i would want to keep them at 
theoretic.com, but i would name you as the primary developer, and head 
of the project. you'd be in control. any takers? contact me, i'll 
explain what i want.

i am also working on releasing a 'copy press' program, which i have used 
to create my website, but am now looking to 'generalize' it and release 
it. it is in Perl, and uses xml::simple and template::toolkit to take 
xml files containg data for the webpage, and applies it to a template, 
for dynamically created 'hard' webpages (as opposed to on-the-fly 
generated pages with extra overhead and greater security risk). i have 
*some* ideas for it, but i have not had the time to really brainstorm on 
it yet. if you are interesteed on working on it for me (also at 
theoretic.com, but you'd be the head of the project), contact me.
