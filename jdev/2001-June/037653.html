&gt;&gt;<i> Has there ever been any discussion of a client side scripting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> language for Jabber?  I'm thinking of something along the lines of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mIRC's scripting language for the IRC protocol.
</I>
&gt;<i> That was the source of my original interest in the Tcl client
</I>&gt;<i> (zABBER).  My goal was to have a client that had a scripting
</I>&gt;<i> language interpreter so you could write scripts to do special
</I>&gt;<i> handling of events.  But, alas, it's not that advanced.
</I>
This is also one of the reasons I started developing my client EJab,
which runs inside of Emacs and therefore is naturally scriptable in
everyone's favorite language, Emacs Lisp.  I intentionally designed it
to use hooks for almost everything, so that its behavior could be
modified almost entirely from extenal elisp code.  Unfortunately it's
not very full-featured yet and kind of buggy, nor is it documented at
all, but you're welcome to check it out.

If you're good with elisp and feel like helping out, feel free to
contact me.

And while I'm at it, here's my take on the scripting issue in general.
Some kinds of scripting are more naturally client-based (like randomly
setting an away message, or running a bot), and some are naturally
server-based (like automatically responding to messages, or accepting
or declining subscription requests).

For the latter, I think the proper solution is an extension of
mod_filter.  For the former, I think client-specific languages should
suffice.  I don't really see a need for a cross-client scripting
language as long as the server-side scripting is powerful enough.
Witness the power of procmail and .forward files.  At the moment,
mod_filter may not be as powerful as we might like, but it's miles
ahead of any other IM system.
