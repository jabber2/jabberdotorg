I don't think so, but I've never spent that much time thinking about
security. To me, requiring a password re-send is less heinous than 
storing the password in plaintext anywhere.

Sure. I guess the concept of wanting to be able to change from one method
to another when the starting method is 'proper' 0k *without* involving the
user simply does not compute.

I'm assuming that the plaintext storage is necessary for digest to ensure
security over the wire (as opposed to on the server) - so that different
tokens can be used to keep the digest 'fresh' and different. That I think
is why mod_plain_digest is merely a 'parasite' on mod_plain_auth - it 
lets it do all the work, except for the glory-bit at the credential checking
stage.

I'm sure that this and other issues that may have fallen between the 
cracks will find a good home with the Foundation and the Jabelin project.
I only wish my JabberC learning would go faster so I could help out more
