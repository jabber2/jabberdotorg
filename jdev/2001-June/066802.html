<PRE>I think that I agree with you here; I'm not sure why people want to keep
the vcard as small as possible. Perhaps someone could explain? It certainly
does not have anything to do with crypto :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;The fourth

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree. I'd prefer if vCards would stay small. But maybe vCards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be signable? So we can verify they are real ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Can someone explain this to me?  I'm no crypto expert, so maybe I'm missing
</I>&gt;<i> something...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, what is the obsession that everyone has with keeping vCards as
</I>&gt;<i> small as possible?  I agree that I wouldn't want to see them bloat
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessarily, but they are a container for keeping all the information
</I>&gt;<i> about a person in one place.  Somones public key is information related
</I>&gt;<i> directly to that person, so it *should* be stored in the vCard (even if it
</I>&gt;<i> is also stored somewhere else - such as a trusted server run by a CA so we
</I>&gt;<i> can check to see if the one in the vCard hasn't been altered).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After all, isn't there a &quot;key&quot; field or some such in the vCard spec exactly
</I>&gt;<i> for this purpose?  Are we just going to ignore that and stick it somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> else?  If that's the case, why use the vCard spec at all?  also The vCard
</I>&gt;<i> has room for a BASE64 encoded photo and audio sample of your name (which is
</I>&gt;<i> also a good thing IMO) - I think we can fit a few certificates.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, are these certificates that big?  Aren't we talking about the same
</I>&gt;<i> things that many members of this list see fit to attach to the end of each
</I>&gt;<i> email they send?  (Is a PGP Signature the same as what we are talking about
</I>&gt;<i> here?) My Lotus Notes file is only 4.7K, and it has quite a few x.509
</I>&gt;<i> certificates and god-knows-what else in it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thirdly, how often are vCards downloaded in a typical Jabber client?  Every
</I>&gt;<i> so often when the user right clicks on a client and selects &quot;View vCard&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect, or maybe they are parsed once when the contact list is drawn up to
</I>&gt;<i> populate an &quot;About This User&quot; dialogue...either way...
