<PRE>Ok. Incase anyone was interested in this aswell, we've found a workaround. 

first let me clarify the problem. An external server would like to query the
presence of all users on a Jabber Server. We were worried that the only
solution would be for the main server to have an account with every user in
it's roster. 

The solution is for every user in the community to have an entry in it's
roster of subscription type = &quot;from&quot; for the main Server. This then allows
the main server to probe any user without it existing in it's roster. 

There's still the problem of lots of traffic going from the jabber server to
ours - Could we have an &quot;on request only&quot; setting for presence subscription.
And there's also no - &quot;not online&quot; response to a probe which would save us
having to use a timeout. 

Hope that's of some use,
Mark

Thanks Peter,

Maybe I didn't make myself entirely clear. I know that the JUD is something
seperate. I'm looking for a way to let people search for each other easily
and then see if they are online before requesting to be added to their
roster. Even something similar to the message receipts on mobiles would be
handy, just so you know they've got it and don't twiddle your thumbs waiting
for them when they're not even online. 

Guess I'll have to find another solution for now.

Cheers,
Mark

JUD != roster

JUD is a user database to which people can add themselves, and others can
find them there -- it's a user directory that is entirely optional.

Your roster is *your* contact list. Personally I have some large number of
people in my roster (perhaps 600, I haven't counted in a while). Indeed
you can't get presence for people unless they allow you to do so, and that
is the concept of subscription that's behind your roster.

If you are running your own server for your community, you could write a
server-side module that pulls out the presence of everyone on your server
but that's something you might not want to get into. :)
