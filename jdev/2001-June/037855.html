(1) twice, because of an iq-get to discover authentication methods available,
    followed by an iq-set to send the credentials

(2) it only has the username on the first pass as this is the iq-get, and
    the username is needed (nothing else) to look up the user's spool data,
    so the auth modules can see if the appropriate data is stored for that
    user and that method

(3) auto-register, &quot;comes up as null&quot;?  - hmm. If a user doesn't exist, 
    you get a 401 unauthorized, not a null, on an authentication (iq-set)
    attempt. One way would be to look into how iq:register works - e.g. if
    you try and register an *existing* user you get an error (409 Not
    Available, I think) whereas if the user doesn't exist, the registration
    is successful. I'm not sure this is a good idea anyway, I'm just 
    thinking aloud. 

    There's also the &lt;auth/&gt; 'hack' which allows you to substitute your
    own-rolled authentication mechanism(s), which you might want to look 
    into, as it would give you more control over things.

Hope that helps
