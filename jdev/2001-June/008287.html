Are you asking about the &quot;signable&quot; remark? If so Max is simply talking
about a signature, which ensure the integrity of the vCard.  Normally, a
hashing algorithm such as SHA-1 or MD5 is used for this purpose. Of
course, passing a vCard in plaintext with a signature attached might not
be as great a solution as it first sounds. How do we know both the vCard
and signature weren't modified?

&gt;<i> email they send?  (Is a PGP Signature the same as what we are talking about
</I>&gt;<i> here?) My Lotus Notes file is only 4.7K, and it has quite a few x.509
</I>
A PGP signature is similar in that it ensures integrity, but PGP uses a
different technique to deliver this guarantee.
