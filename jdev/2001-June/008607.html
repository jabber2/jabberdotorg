<PRE>JUD != roster

JUD is a user database to which people can add themselves, and others can
find them there -- it's a user directory that is entirely optional.

Your roster is *your* contact list. Personally I have some large number of
people in my roster (perhaps 600, I haven't counted in a while). Indeed
you can't get presence for people unless they allow you to do so, and that
is the concept of subscription that's behind your roster.

If you are running your own server for your community, you could write a
server-side module that pulls out the presence of everyone on your server
but that's something you might not want to get into. :)
