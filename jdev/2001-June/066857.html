&gt;<i> I never had any problems with &quot;moving ISPs&quot; etc. I have my own domain
</I>&gt;<i> name (could cost me less than $1 per month, but I also have some
</I>&gt;<i> value-added stuff, so I pay more), so I never worry about changing
</I>&gt;<i> ISPs - I can just change the redirect.
</I>
Max, probably so do most of the people on this list.  However I think you
will agree that this list isn't a good cross-section of normal internet
users.  Most users don't even know what a domain name is, let alone how to
register one.

Actually you make just as good an example as anyone.  I assume that one day
you will want your jabber address to be <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">max at quendi.de</A> or similar, so when
that happens you will have to resubscribe to everyone who is on your
@jabber.org jabber account to your new account, and somehow inform everyone
that you will no longer be online from your old account, and they must
change all of their rosters if they want to continue talking to you (delete
you from their old lists - woops, there goes all that message histroy too).
Gee, I hope you didn't get any business cards printed up with your jabber
address on, because you will have to throw all those out and get new ones
printed.

&gt;<i> Heck, in real life, when I
</I>&gt;<i> move, I must inform people about this, too. And I can tell the post
</I>&gt;<i> office to redirect letters to me, and even automatically tell senders
</I>&gt;<i> that I moved (if I want that - I usually prefer choosing myself whom
</I>&gt;<i> I inform ;)
</I>
That's the worst analogy that I have ever heard.  Just because something
sucks in real life, there is no reason for it to continue to to suck on the
net.  If you must relate it to the postal system somehow, you chould think
of it more like getting a PO Box.  People often get post office boxes if
they are moving around a lot or want to remain anonymous.  Even if you move
houses your mail will still go to the same place.

Michael.
