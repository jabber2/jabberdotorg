I would say a third method should just be to have the authentication module
handle authentication, not the server. Currently for all three methods
(plaintext, digest, 0k), the server fetches data and compares internally - it
should instead just *ask* some external authentication service whether or not
the user is authenticated.

This would not provide migration for users within jabber XDB to some service
outside of xdb - but if you are authenticating against a system such as
LDAP or kerberos, you don't want to do this anyways.

&gt;<i> So far this has not been an issue because we've always had the plaintext
</I>&gt;<i> password on the server which served as the common data format for password
</I>&gt;<i> information (method 1 with plaintext being the special password storage
</I>&gt;<i> format... ha ha ha).  It was easy to upgrade to 0k because we could upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> people on the server using the plaintext password.  However, I expect that
</I>&gt;<i> many/most would like to use the 0k advantage of no plaintext password at
</I>&gt;<i> all on the server.  If this is the case, then the next auth protocol (if
</I>&gt;<i> there will be one) is in for some trouble if we don't address things
</I>&gt;<i> sometime.
</I>
If someone really wants passwords to be secure, they need to use a secure
method of account registration, authentication, and renewal in the case of 0k.
The only secure registration method I've seen so far is Jabber-thru-SSL, and
the server does not enforce any behavior based on the connection being through
or not through SSL (such as limiting plaintext authentication, turning off
registration, not allowing password changes). There is a lot of work left.
