<PRE>Glad you brought up this point.  I've been wondering about highly related 
issues that might as well get thrown in.

Note: my comments are from a general server design standpoint and not 
specific to jabberd.

I've been playing around with these issues and from a modular standpoint, 
the system seems a bit incomplete.  Theoretically, when you plug in a new 
auth module, you should be able to use it to immediately authenticate new 
and existing accounts (accounts established and authenticated against older 
user records).  For instance, I should be able to unplug digest and plug in 
0k and keep on chugging.

It would seem that the only real way of doing this is to store the 
plaintext password and user name _somewhere_ so you can move records from 
one authentication system to another.  (storing plain passwords, hashes, or 
0k sequences).  At least with the current system.  Now the implementation 
may encrypt all these passwords so only the server can access them, or 
perhaps a migration utility in the server, etc... but at some point, 
somewhere, the plaintext passwords will need to exist.  Otherwise, when you 
plug in a next generation authentication system, you'll need to have 
everyone re-send or regenerate their password info.

Am I missing something?

This of course assumes that we need to worry about new auth protocols.  If 
the existing 2 and a half (see side note at bottom) auth protocols are 
pretty much it, then I guess there's not much of an issue here.  However, 
since I doubt that this is true, it seems to be a serious problem for 
upgrading existing servers that may have thousands of user accounts.  I 
guess what I'm trying to say is, I would like to see the auth system build 
to support secure _and_ seamless upgrades of authentication systems.

Method 1:  My thought is either we establish a standard server-side 
password data &quot;format&quot; other than plaintext to provide a common &quot;seed&quot; 
password that can be used to generate passwords in whatever module we are 
using.  So when we install a new module and the existing user accounts 
don't have password data in their format, they can ask the server, &quot;hey, 
give me a seed for this user&quot;, and use the data to generate its data.  The 
reason we need it standardized is so that future auth algorithms can be 
designed to be compatible with the data.  To avoid plaintext, we store the 
password in a way that the data displays certain mathematical properties 
that can be exploited for generating new passwords in new systems while 
preventing their use to generate current passwords with current 
systems.  Probably not a trivial task.

Method 2:  Another approach is to establish yet another protocol to allow 
clients to authenticate with an existing auth module, then once logged in, 
generate new information with a new auth module to &quot;upgrade&quot; to that 
authentication scheme.  This protocol can be very simple (e.g. force the 
client to auth twice: first with one module then with another) but the 
clients need to know about this in a standard (otherwise, only client A 
will work with server A).  This approach is basically a &quot;let the client 
worry about it&quot; strategy.  The client must know the plain text password, 
and can authenticate against both systems using it.  The worry is that 
client's will have a lot of auth bloat having to be able to support all 
auth systems in order to seamlessly access any jabber server (versus only 
needing to know about one auth method and use it on any jabber server if 
the server's are responsible for making these conversions).

So far this has not been an issue because we've always had the plaintext 
password on the server which served as the common data format for password 
information (method 1 with plaintext being the special password storage 
format... ha ha ha).  It was easy to upgrade to 0k because we could upgrade 
people on the server using the plaintext password.  However, I expect that 
many/most would like to use the 0k advantage of no plaintext password at 
all on the server.  If this is the case, then the next auth protocol (if 
there will be one) is in for some trouble if we don't address things 
sometime.

&lt;side note&gt;It would be nice nice for server's to be backward compatible and 
still support digest if not plaintext passwords.  In this case, the 
plaintext password still needs to be stored on the server even if 0k is 
used.  I am curious to know how many are dumping backward compatibility for 
the sake of security (pure 0k), and how many are using both or all three 
(but since they store passwords on the server, what is the advantage of 
0k?).  How many clients support 0k when the spec isn't finished or 
&quot;approved&quot;?&lt;/side node&gt;

</I>
&lt;side note&gt;I would really like to see someone (whoever implemented it in 
jabberd) take a whack at updating this doc.    I figure they could do it 
much easier than having one of us reverse engineer the protocol or grunt 
through the server code.  The whole &quot;bootstrap&quot; process of the 
authentication algorithm is left out and really should be specified... From 
a &quot;clean room&quot; server implementation standpoint (someone not working or 
looking at jabberd) the current omission makes 0k pretty much useless.  I 
suppose we should wait until the Foundation/JEP/JIG etc is all settled 
first...  *sigh*&lt;/side note&gt;

ps - sorry for the rant.
