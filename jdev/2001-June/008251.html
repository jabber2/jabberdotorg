</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>- Having a <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">username at hostname</A> address format is actually one of the few good

Right.


&gt;<i>- It's a good way of avoiding centralisation, as any computer can be a
</I>&gt;<i>server without registering itself with any authority other than the DNS
</I>&gt;<i>system
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i>- Yeah, I agree that being tied to one particular server is bad when you
</I>&gt;<i>want to move, but it's better than the alternative. Just imagine every email
</I>&gt;<i>user in the world competing in a single namespace. The Hotmail problem of
</I>&gt;<i>being called mikehearn30503 would be multiplied to the nth degree!
</I>
Right ;)


I never had any problems with &quot;moving ISPs&quot; etc. I have my own domain 
name (could cost me less than $1 per month, but I also have some 
value-added stuff, so I pay more), so I never worry about changing 
ISPs - I can just change the redirect. Heck, in real life, when I 
move, I must inform people about this, too. And I can tell the post 
office to redirect letters to me, and even automatically tell senders 
that I moved (if I want that - I usually prefer choosing myself whom 
I inform ;)



&gt;<i>However, I agree with you that we need better ways of allowing people to
</I>&gt;<i>move between servers. So, here are some ideas:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>- A redirect protocol which allows a server to automatically redirect
</I>&gt;<i>packets destined for one account to another transparently, possibly with
</I>&gt;<i>some kind of return warning that the account name has changed and that a
</I>&gt;<i>redirect has taken place. This should preferably be independant of the
</I>&gt;<i>server (ie can be set by a client) to stop an ISP holding you to ransom with
</I>&gt;<i>your Jabber identity.
</I>
This is already possible using iq:filter, I think (or at least used 
to be possible ;)


&gt;<i>- A way of downloading to a local file, then reuploading your roster
</I>&gt;<i>(INCLUDING private namespaces), so you can transfer all information that is
</I>&gt;<i>owned by you between servers.
</I>
Again something for clients.... in fact, I was asked several times to 
allow users to &quot;backup&quot; a roster and restore it. This would include 
changes like &quot;aim.jabber.org&quot; -&gt; &quot;aim.jabber.com&quot;.

Also think of JabberTools which allows you to import AIM/ICQ/etc. 
data files - how about adding the functionality to im/export jabber 
roster files (and iq:private storage, ok)
