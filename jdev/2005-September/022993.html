<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Sometimes I think it would have been neat if nodes were part of JIDs in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first place... then each service could have been a node off the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server's own JID, and everything would be happy.  Well, maybe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For pubsub, JEP-0060 section 4 (Addressing), mentions how you can do
</I>&gt;<i> this by putting the node identifier in the resource part of the service's
</I>&gt;<i> JID. Any pubsub node identified by NodeID at pubsub service example.com
</I>&gt;<i> would be addressable using the JID example.com/NodeId. If you have a
</I>&gt;<i> personal pubsub services (virtual?) for <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at example.com</A>, then you could
</I>&gt;<i> have <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at example.com</A>/NodeID point to the NodeID node for this user.
</I>
That covers PubSub, but I was more talking about doing it in general.

If the above rules applied in all cases, the JID for the commands service
running off my current Psi instance would be...

<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">trejkaz at jabber.zim.net.au</A>/work/windows/<A HREF="http://jabber.org/protocol/commands">http://jabber.org/protocol/commands</A>

Because of course, that commands node is a different node at each
resource, so merely putting it after the bare JID wouldn't suffice.

&gt;<i> Note the a 'Jabber Server' is really just some entity
</I>&gt;<i> that provides a s2s service. For example, a pubsub service could just as
</I>&gt;<i> well be an application that implements s2s.
</I>
Indeed.  In a way, I wish it were common to do it this way instead of
hanging all the components like dongles off the main server.  You wouldn't
even need the component protocol at that point.  SRV entries would already
let us run every component on its own port for direct contacting.
