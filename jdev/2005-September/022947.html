<PRE>&gt;<i> Richard, I have to say I agree with Jive on this one.  Not because I
</I>&gt;<i> disagree with your SMTP and HTTP examples, they are flawless.  The
</I>&gt;<i> issue I have encountered myself is simply that it didn't make sense to
</I>&gt;<i> me to have a different domain name for every service on a server.  I
</I>&gt;<i> was assuming all along that this was a design decision (or flaw) of
</I>&gt;<i> jabberd1 to be honest, not a requirement of XMPP.  After all, you can
</I>&gt;<i> certainly run an SMTP and HTTP server and a million others all on the
</I>&gt;<i> same server using the same domain name.
</I>
But you cant, if you are comparing apples to apples then no you cant run two 
entirely different SMTP servers on the same domain name without encountering 
problems, yes you can run and SMTP server and a HTTP server on the same 
domain, but the same goes for being able to run an XMPP server and an HTTP 
or SMTP server, the reason you can do this is because they use different 
protocols on the different ports.

&gt;<i>  Jabber is the only software
</I>&gt;<i> that I have heard of that breaks pieces out this way.
</I>
Not really, if you use the example of SMTP you cant run two entirely 
different email services on the same domain.

&gt;<i> When I was first messing with jabber several years ago, it was to
</I>&gt;<i> setup a workgroup server in my large enterprise.  It took me some time
</I>&gt;<i> to realize that those extra subdomains were really required, not
</I>&gt;<i> suggested.  IIRC I actually faked them with local host file entries
</I>&gt;<i> during my experimentation.  It was easier to do that than wade the
</I>&gt;<i> bottomless pit that is IT support.
</I>
Sure but once you come to officially deploying after you have stabilised it 
whats the problem with getting the DNS entries setup? Yea if you are in a 
large company you might have to go through some effort getting them setup, 
but those processes will have been defined for a reason, if you are in a 
company you have to control updates to the DNS you cant just let anyone 
change stuff willy nilly, you would have anarchy.

&gt;<i> So what I'm saying is all of your problems raised above would not be
</I>&gt;<i> problems if everything could be done on one domain name.  Wow, Jive is
</I>&gt;<i> giving me that.
</I>
But its not, the services are on their own domains, but that is one solution 
to this problem, simply implement the server so that everything appears on 
the same domain name, you are more likely to get overlaps of JID username 
parts when all users and conference rooms etc are all running from the same 
domain name, but its an entirely workable solution, e.g.

User
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user1 at example.com</A>

Room
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">room1 at example.com</A>

or you could diferentiate rooms by preappending them with something to make 
them more unique e.g.

<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">room-jdev at example.com</A>
