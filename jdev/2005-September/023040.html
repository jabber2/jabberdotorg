<PRE>I'm kind of at the tail end of this, but I had problems with UTF-8 and some
Microsoft coding in a perl script that had nothing to do with jabber; it
sounded like it could help.  I was querying a sql database and writing out
an RSS feed.  I ended up using the Encode module.  Here are the relevant
code fragments and comments from that script.  I hope it is useful.

Cheers--

Al

use Encode;           # Module to handle Unicode and UTF-8

...

# 
	# General data--it is possible that the title and description fields
	# could contain data that is WINDOWS-1252 (Microsoft Code Page
1252).
	# decode() translates the WINDOWS-1252 code to the appropriate (Perl
	# internal) UTF8 code.  By decoding these fields we ensure that the
	# proper UTF-8 code is used for these characters rather than any
	# default produced by opening our output files as :utf8 in
	# write_feeds().
	# 
	title	=&gt; decode ('WINDOWS-1252', $title),
	description =&gt; decode ('WINDOWS-1252', $description),
	link =&gt;

...

#
       # We open the channel to output in UTF-8 encoding.  This eliminates
       # any &quot;wide character&quot; errors and ensures that our feeds are
completely
       # UTF-8 just in case our decode() back in build_feed() missed
something.
       #
       open( CHANNEL,'&gt;:utf8', &quot;Channel$channel.rss&quot;) || die &quot;Cannot open
file Channel$channel.rss for write: $!&quot;;
       print CHANNEL ${&quot;rss_&quot;.$channel}-&gt;as_string;
       close CHANNEL;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That is very surprising. Since Perl probably has nothing to do with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; unicode here, the culprit has to be jabberd then. I'll try to upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (though I use the apt-get system for which the most recent versions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; don't always exist).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Back up a second there ;) Perl is notorious for being bad with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unicode, wether that's a repuation still deserved I don't know, but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was justified in the past. And afaik never in the history of jabberd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has there been such a serious problem with UTF-8 handeling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are absolutely right. I tried using another public jabber server,
</I>&gt;<i> before installing one myself, and same malfunction happened.
</I>&gt;<i> I even tried Psi, and that didn't make it work either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think you should consider first:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - is the file UTF-8? (you seem to have this covered)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - is your version of Perl configured right to read unicode UTF-8files..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure about this... Perl can get configured? During compile time
</I>&gt;<i> you mean? Also I didn't think that Perl could have anything to do with
</I>&gt;<i> this, because the libraries (Net::XMPP::etc and Net::Jabber::etc) don't
</I>&gt;<i> contain the string 'utf8' anywhere, so I was guessing that these
</I>&gt;<i> libraries were just passing whatever data they found inside the &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> tags without regard for utf8 compliance... but I guess I was wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - *and* to use unicode for string handeling by default
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, it doesn't have that (and 5.8.6 has that?). It has got to be Perl's
</I>&gt;<i> fault, but perhaps there's a way to avoid installing a second version of
</I>&gt;<i> Perl on my system (I've got to keep the old one too, so many .debs are
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on it in some way) - is this advice you're giving accurate?
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. are newer versions of Perl handling unicode by default? If so,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe I can just plug a 'use utf8;' command or type-in some CLI switch
</I>&gt;<i> and make it all happen...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And what do you mean by Perl being able to read unicode files right?
</I>&gt;<i> Aren't utf8 files just a series of bytes in Perl's eyes, just like any
</I>&gt;<i> other file?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - do you have the most recent Net::Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and there's only two versions of Net::Jabber (0.1 and 1.0) so all
</I>&gt;<i> have the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not critizing you or anything, but I'm worried you'll loose a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time accomplishing very little trying to find a UTF-8 bug in jabberd.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabberd's unicode handeling is independant of how your system is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; setup, how you build it, etc. The same can not be said for Perl. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you're still not convinced it's not jabberd, try another server (a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public one).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and thanks, you did save me. Installing jabberd 1.4.4 was the next
</I>&gt;<i> thing I was going to do... but it's Perl's fault actually :-)
