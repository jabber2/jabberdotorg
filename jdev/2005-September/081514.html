<PRE>&gt;<i> Thanks for the bug report. We've now fixed the category and type (bug
</I>&gt;<i> fix will be in next release). The name is now &quot;Jive Messenger Server&quot; by
</I>&gt;<i> default, but that default can be changed by editing a configuration
</I>&gt;<i> file.
</I>
You are welcome ;)

&gt;<i> Yep, same issue -- <A HREF="http://www.jivesoftware.org/issues/browse/JM-407.">http://www.jivesoftware.org/issues/browse/JM-407.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> We've implemented a fix and will hopefully roll it out to the server
</I>&gt;<i> later today.
</I>
Cool good good.

&gt;<i> This general subdomain issue was actually a really interesting one for
</I>&gt;<i> us when implementing s2s. One thing I find frustrating is that DNS
</I>&gt;<i> entries have to be made in order to get s2s sub-domains to work with
</I>&gt;<i> most servers. That's a bummer for things like MUC, where server admins
</I>&gt;<i> might not have easy access to DNS but still want the service. So, the
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm we use is to examine the server domain and attempt connections
</I>&gt;<i> to the subdomain tree in order. So, if connecting from another JM server
</I>&gt;<i> to conference.foo.jivesoftware.com:
</I>
&gt;<i>  1) Try s2s connection to conference.foo.jivesoftware.com. If that
</I>&gt;<i> fails:
</I>&gt;<i>  2) Try connection to foo.jivesoftware.com. If that fails:
</I>&gt;<i>  3) Try connection to jivesoftware.com.
</I>
&gt;<i> So, let's say that your XMPP server is actually foo.jivesoftware.com. In
</I>&gt;<i> that case, conference.foo.jivesoftware.com will still work from the
</I>&gt;<i> other JM server even if you don't have DNS setup for conference.foo.
</I>
Interesting solution but not exactly standard, and will only work between 
servers that are running Jive Messenger, according to the specs for s2s the 
fact that the MUC service is a subdomain of another server is irrelivant, 
its not the root domain that the other servers are trying to talk to its the 
conference service itself directly, thus the need to have the DNS records 
setup correctly so that they can even see if it exists, I would suggest that 
if your users dont have access to add DNS records for subdomains then they 
either obtain that access or simply purchase a new domain for their MUC 
service to be known as e.g. conference-jivesoftware.com, whether the MUC 
service is known as conference.jivesoftware.com or 
conference-jivesoftware.com should make no difference.
