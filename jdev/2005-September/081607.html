Back up a second there ;) Perl is notorious for being bad with unicode,  
wether that's a repuation still deserved I don't know, but it was  
justified in the past. And afaik never in the history of jabberd has there  
been such a serious problem with UTF-8 handeling.

I think you should consider first:
- is the file UTF-8? (you seem to have this covered)
- is your version of Perl configured right to read unicode UTF-8files..
- *and* to use unicode for string handeling by default
- do you have the most recent Net::Jabber

Not critizing you or anything, but I'm worried you'll loose a lot of time  
accomplishing very little trying to find a UTF-8 bug in jabberd. Jabberd's  
unicode handeling is independant of how your system is setup, how you  
build it, etc. The same can not be said for Perl. If you're still not  
convinced it's not jabberd, try another server (a public one).
