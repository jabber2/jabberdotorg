I think the point here is not the technical accuracy of your
arguments, which I cannot flaw, but rather the point of view that an
end user or power user or system administrator who has never worked
with Jabber servers before, will simply compare Jabber to email
(because we encourage that, right?) and draw the conclusion to which I
am referring.  Whether its a design flaw or a feature doesn't matter,
it's certainly unique, and that leads to incorrect assumptions.

Ooh, ooh I know this one!  Your server or workstation already has an
external DNS entry.  The problem is that you've only got ONE.
