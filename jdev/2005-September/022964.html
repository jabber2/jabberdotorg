&gt;<i> Hey all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We take security issues very seriously and appreciate the feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> However, some of the reactions in this thread are simply unreasonable.
</I>&gt;<i> Why do so many JSF discussions wax into flame wars? :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I'd like to take a step back and try to step through the issues.
</I>&gt;<i> First, unless there's an evil XMPP server, you'll never run into
</I>&gt;<i> problems. Servers are required to reject stream connections for domains
</I>&gt;<i> that they don't control. So, if &quot;example.blah.com&quot; isn't controlled by
</I>&gt;<i> the XMPP server &quot;blah.com&quot;, than an s2s connection for that subdomain
</I>&gt;<i> will be rejected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, let's consider the case of an evil XMPP server. If somebody has
</I>&gt;<i> managed to subvert your DNS tree, you're pretty much already screwed.
</I>&gt;<i> Why wouldn't they just take over DNS of your normal server address? Even
</I>&gt;<i> those of you that use dyndns and other such services where you don't
</I>&gt;<i> control the full tree are in the same boat. Let's take the example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  someuser.dyndns.org
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assume your server is down so some Jive Messenger instance tries to make
</I>&gt;<i> the connection to dyndns.org. If an evil XMPP server truly lives at that
</I>&gt;<i> address, how could you possibly trust that your dynamic DNS entry is
</I>&gt;<i> also valid? Can anyone come up with a real example of this DNS attack
</I>&gt;<i> being a greater vulnerability than standard dialback? If you don't trust
</I>&gt;<i> your DNS tree, I would argue that the security of dialback is already
</I>&gt;<i> compromised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, dialback itself. I think it provides good security for most users.
</I>&gt;<i> However, dialback + TLS doesn't seem to be implemented by any servers
</I>&gt;<i> yet. We're going to create an implementation for Jive Messenger because
</I>&gt;<i> we think it offers a great mix of security and ease of use. The most
</I>&gt;<i> common secure s2s mechanism we've found so far is dialback + SASL
</I>&gt;<i> external. For security, it's pretty much critical that the certificate
</I>&gt;<i> presented through SASL external be signed by a CA. We're just completing
</I>&gt;<i> our TLS + SASL external implementation now and will likely support all
</I>&gt;<i> the major CA's by default. Based on many threads on this mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> I'd also like to support certs signed by CACert.org by default. Anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> assuming that servers are using TLS + SASL external, even a DNS attack
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't compromise the security of the Jive Messenger algorithm -- they
</I>&gt;<i> would also need to subvert the CA cert signing process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I disagree that this is a minor security hole. The fact that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my JM server can potentially contact two completely different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; servers for the same JID is a very bad thing. Jabber ID's are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; designed to be unique, and they should be. This uniqueness is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provided by using domain names to help partition off the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; namespace. What you are essentially doing is flattening this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; namespace by changing your implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ie, when my server contacts <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">foo at conference.jabber.org</A>, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should NEVER, EVER, try to send that message to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">foo at jabber.org</A> instead. This seems very bad to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Umm, I think you misunderstand. Actually what happens is that the JM
</I>&gt;<i> instance will connect to jabber.org but attempt to send the packet to
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">foo at conference.jabber.org.</A> JID uniqueness is never violated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From David Waite:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is that servers which implement the XMPP standard and which don't
</I>&gt;<i> add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this DNS hack will not be able to contact all the services someone may
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they are also running under Jive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We still tell users to make the DNS entries for compatibility with other
</I>&gt;<i> servers. But, a good example of when users might not bother to make the
</I>&gt;<i> DNS entries when using JM is when they want to connect multiple XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> servers together but only inside their org (east-coast.example.com,
</I>&gt;<i> west-coast.example.com, etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Matt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm. I didn't read the specs or jeps fully yet but mainaining a jabber server.
I agree with Matt that it's a bummer how jids are constructed. But my suggestion
would be to make it as consistant as possible for the user. As a user
I know that
a jid is &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">username at server.net</A>&quot;. And from this view I can browse for services on
the server &quot;server.net&quot;.

My suggestion would be to list services like &quot;server.net/service&quot;.
This would be a
resource for the server. A muc-room would be &quot;server.net/muc/room&quot; and
a user using
this mucroom would have the jid &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at server.net</A>/muc/room&quot; or
just &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at server</A>/room&quot;.

Just an idea.
