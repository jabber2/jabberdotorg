Right, this is problematic. I don't have a quick solution there.

&gt;<i> &gt; Note the a 'Jabber Server' is really just some entity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that provides a s2s service. For example, a pubsub service could just as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well be an application that implements s2s.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed.  In a way, I wish it were common to do it this way instead of

</I>&gt;<i> even need the component protocol at that point.  SRV entries would already
</I>&gt;<i> let us run every component on its own port for direct contacting.
</I>
Of course jabberd 1 has always supported components that are directly
linked in. Those components don't use the component protocol. I still
believe there is value in having that protocol though. Exposing
components directly via s2s has disadvantages, too.
