<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Interesting solution but not exactly standard, and will only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;work between servers that are running Jive Messenger,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True. However, the nice thing about the logic is that normal DNS is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tried first. We also recommend that users setup DNS for max
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compatibility. Even so, the extra logic means that if normal DNS
</I>isn't
&gt;<i> &gt; or can't be setup, the service will still work if the other server
</I>is
&gt;<i> &gt; JM. So far, we don't see a reason that this couldn't be added as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation recommendation attached to the RFC's.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This really sounds like a bad idea to me. This implies that in the
</I>case of
&gt;<i> user
</I>&gt;<i> error, for example a user who tries to connect to a service such as
</I>&gt;<i> conference.uct.ac.za, a JM server will try to resolve and connect to
</I>&gt;<i> uct.ac.za
</I>&gt;<i> and then ac.za ? Just moving up the tree isn't a reasonable
</I>assumption.

It seems like a reasonable, but obviously not 100% accurate, assumption
to me. Most installations run at least a conference server along with
their main server. With our server implementation you get conferencing,
pubsub, JEP-0065 Proxy, and a user directory installed and running by
default, all on the same host. If you want those to be available to the
outside world you have to setup quite a few DNS entries. As Matt
mentioned, it is often very difficult, or impossible, for administrators
to get DNS entries put in for all of the possible sub domains -- even
the root one.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of 1 NXDOMAIN dns lookup result, you have either 3 failed
</I>lookups,
&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps worse, 2 failed connection attempts to resolvable addresses
</I>which
&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> no jabber servers running there, or perhaps completely unrelated
</I>servers
&gt;<i> (in
</I>&gt;<i> which case the failure gets even messier).
</I>
That doesn't seem so horrible to me. Personally, I'd rather have a more
simplified setup to increase adoption of cross domain XMPP/Jabber.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is bad engineering i.t.o. creating undesirable impact on the
</I>broader
&gt;<i> Internet.
</I>
What is the undesirable impact? Sure, there are a few more DNS lookups
and potentially more connections and some stream errors. That doesn't
seem like much of an impact. I don't see the harm in connecting to hosts
that do not provide service to the domain you need. This is flushed out
rather quickly in the S2S process.
