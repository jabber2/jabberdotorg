We've already seen some pretty good explanations in the last of how pubsub can 
run directly off normal JIDs, and I suspect that many services will work in a 
similar fashion.  Basically it seems that anything which doesn't receive 
ordinary &lt;message&gt;s would work just crammed onto one JID.

</I>
Funnily enough though, that rule Psi is still using would still hold.  
example.com would still be a service. :-)

The difference would be... <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at example.com</A> would now not necessarily be an 
ordinary user.  But actually, that isn't even the case today when MUC rooms 
have user-like JIDs already.

&gt;<i> 2) Name collisions. As has previously been noted, this is easily
</I>&gt;<i> avoided through prefixes and there's probably much nicer methods.
</I>
Prefixes would indeed work, and one of the &quot;nicer&quot; methods would be simply to 
not give out the same name for a user and a conference room in the first 
place.

As for the multi-DNS thing... we solve that using a wildcard entry.  But I 
guess this is only really a problem for people without access to their DNS.
