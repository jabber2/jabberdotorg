Wrong - ask any CA if they want to be held responsible for what people do  
with the certificates that get handed out to them. They'll say: hell no.  
The only thing they try to sell you on, is that when one of those  
certificates is used (for example to enable encryption) you can be pretty  
damned sure (I doubt that even the CAs will try and convince you it's 100%  
sure, not CAcert nor any of the others) it was registered by who/whatever  
the certificate says it is registered to. That's it folks, how badly you  
want to put your trust in the person/orginization listed there, is your  
own responsibility, and any CA will tell you that.

In the case of open dailback/sasl, that means putting your trust in  
complete strangers. I don't know about you, but that's not how I typically  
run the LDAP server for a domain.
