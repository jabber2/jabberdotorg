Well that's... exactly what I said. And agree it's a better solution. Of  
course, #2 has to work the other way around as well (registered channel -&gt;  
don't allow username). I also checked the DISCO JEP to be sure that one  
jid can have multiple identities (which it can).

The problem I can see is that if you &quot;disco&quot; to a server, it will list all  
the MUC channels. Though I think this can be solved by using resources.  
Instead of pointing from example.org to conf.example.org, you can point to  
example.org/conf, which can than give a list AFAIK of rooms @example.org  
with no problem.
