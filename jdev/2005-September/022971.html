<PRE>David,

Yep, I'm in agreement with all of your points. We thought long and hard
about how to come up with a reasonable workaround for the name collision
issue and couldn't. That's how we arrived at the parent DNS algorithm
workaround.

Regards,
Matt

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's a bummer that JID's weren't constructed to deal with this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sub-domain issue from the beginning. For example, they 
</I>&gt;<i> could have been 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the form:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; node/<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">service at server.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would work great since &quot;/&quot; is already a prohibited 
</I>&gt;<i> character in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> no no no.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The whole reason you _can't_ run every service on one domain 
</I>&gt;<i> name today is because people attached semantic meaning to 
</I>&gt;<i> portions of the identifiers, causing collisions and confusion 
</I>&gt;<i> in naming. Adding a level of categorization to the JID would 
</I>&gt;<i> solve the symptoms, but not the actual problem. For example, 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't really get away with having
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">room-general at server.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user-foo at server.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> for groupchats and users unless I'm willing to live with 
</I>&gt;<i> rooms having the 'room-' prefix on all their displayed names, 
</I>&gt;<i> and only allowing registration if someone types in 
</I>&gt;<i> 'room-&lt;whatever&gt;'. Nor can I go with an internal naming system like
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">muc at server.com</A>/general/user3
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It simplified writing clients because there was less metadata 
</I>&gt;<i> to deal with for interacting with services - but pushed the 
</I>&gt;<i> uniqueness requirement out to the DNS level. This had the 
</I>&gt;<i> benefit for users in-the-know that they could look at a jid 
</I>&gt;<i> and have a good idea that 'conference.jabber.org' probably 
</I>&gt;<i> was something they used groupchat to talk to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pretty much your only option for single domain name usage 
</I>&gt;<i> would be to take the naming conflict hit; to not allow having 
</I>&gt;<i> a 'general' room and a 'general' user at the same time. There 
</I>&gt;<i> would be no naming hint to indicate how you are supposed to 
</I>&gt;<i> interact with 'general', which would cause user confusion 
</I>&gt;<i> (there isn't a fundamental type of interaction or discovery 
</I>&gt;<i> within XMPP, and extensions like disco are sadly 
</I>&gt;<i> undersupported). You would also be unable to expose a transport (like
</I>&gt;<i> msn.jabber.org) because there wouldn't be a way to prevent 
</I>&gt;<i> the namespaces from colliding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Adding type of to the URI is something that just isn't recommended.
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, when I go to a web site with a http URL, I have 
</I>&gt;<i> no idea whether that is a static page, a dynamic page, an 
</I>&gt;<i> image, or a WebDAV share. Likewise, when I have an email 
</I>&gt;<i> address, there isn't anything within that 'mailto' that 
</I>&gt;<i> distinguishes a user or administrative account from a mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list or SOAP endpoint. Add in that categorization, and it 
</I>&gt;<i> quickly explodes into.. well, MIME.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -David Waite
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think pre-fixes are a reasonable general approach, though. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let's say that a new service is invented as a JEP called 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;foobar&quot;. You 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could then mandate that any JID pre-pended with &quot;foobar-&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> belongs to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that service on your example.com server. But, what if there's some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unfortunate person on your server named Foobar Smith that 
</I>&gt;<i> already has 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the JID <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">foobar-smith at example.com</A>? It's just not possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> anticipate 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all name conflicts unless we agreed on some format to 
</I>&gt;<i> restrict nodes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using some specific format. I don't see how that would be possible 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without adding in some restrictions that aren't part of the XMPP 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RFC's, but I'm open to ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The semantic meaning of the node portion of the JID makes it 
</I>&gt;<i> a tough and limiting choice. For instance, even 
</I>&gt;<i> administrator-created fixed muc room names will cause a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem if your users are maintained externally, such as within LDAP.
</I>&gt;<i>
