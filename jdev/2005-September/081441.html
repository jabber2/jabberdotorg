<PRE>
Thanks to everybody that answered the question.

I started looking at the component protocol but there are a couple of 
things I don't understand.

It is clear to me that if I send messages from a client to the component 
JID the component will get the message. But I didn't see anywhere in the 
component protocol how to make the component process all the messages the 
server get (that would be the way for me to forward some of those requests 
to my application server).

I think jabberd has a configuration option to make the component get some 
of the messages (a &lt;bcc&gt; tag) and I saw that with Jive a could write a 
plugin that can accomplish a similar effect. But is there a &quot;standard&quot; way 
to configure a component to do do what I need ?

Thanks!
