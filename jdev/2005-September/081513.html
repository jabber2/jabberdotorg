<PRE>Richard,

&gt;<i> Just giving this a go and it seems the server directly at 
</I>&gt;<i> jivesoftware.com is returning incorrect disco info 
</I>&gt;<i> information for itself, i.e. it returns an identity of
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;identity category=&quot;services&quot; name=&quot;Messenger Server&quot; type=&quot;jabber&quot;/&gt;
</I>
Thanks for the bug report. We've now fixed the category and type (bug
fix will be in next release). The name is now &quot;Jive Messenger Server&quot; by
default, but that default can be changed by editing a configuration
file.
 
&gt;<i> I have also found that S2S to the main server seems to work 
</I>&gt;<i> fine, but S2S to conference.jivesoftware.com or 
</I>&gt;<i> workgroup.jivesoftware.com (the two items listed under 
</I>&gt;<i> jivesoftware.com disco) does not seem to work, it seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> reject dialback attempts with not-authorised, I suppose this 
</I>&gt;<i> is the issue you mentioned.
</I>
Yep, same issue -- <A HREF="http://www.jivesoftware.org/issues/browse/JM-407.">http://www.jivesoftware.org/issues/browse/JM-407.</A>
We've implemented a fix and will hopefully roll it out to the server
later today.

This general subdomain issue was actually a really interesting one for
us when implementing s2s. One thing I find frustrating is that DNS
entries have to be made in order to get s2s sub-domains to work with
most servers. That's a bummer for things like MUC, where server admins
might not have easy access to DNS but still want the service. So, the
algorithm we use is to examine the server domain and attempt connections
to the subdomain tree in order. So, if connecting from another JM server
to conference.foo.jivesoftware.com:

 1) Try s2s connection to conference.foo.jivesoftware.com. If that
fails:
 2) Try connection to foo.jivesoftware.com. If that fails:
 3) Try connection to jivesoftware.com.

So, let's say that your XMPP server is actually foo.jivesoftware.com. In
that case, conference.foo.jivesoftware.com will still work from the
other JM server even if you don't have DNS setup for conference.foo.

Regards,
Matt
