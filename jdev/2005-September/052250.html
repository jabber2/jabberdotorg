<PRE>Kevin,

&gt;<i> Let's please quickly agree that it's something to address, 
</I>&gt;<i> and that second-guessing dns entries isn't the way to do it. 
</I>
I disagree that our algorithm is a serious security issue (see my last
email), but would still love to get rid of it. It's a hack that's only
there because there's not another better solution we could think of.

&gt;<i> 2) Name collisions. As has previously been noted, this is 
</I>&gt;<i> easily avoided through prefixes and there's probably much 
</I>&gt;<i> nicer methods.
</I>
If this was an easy problem to solve, why didn't everybody just go this
route rather than building out the subdomain system?
 
&gt;<i> 4) JEP-045. I've just been through the muc jep, and I can't 
</I>&gt;<i> find anything which prohibit it sitting on the main server. 
</I>&gt;<i> The pertinent lines seem to be:
</I>
Jive Messenger and several other servers implement MUC natively (without
an external component). However, we use an artifical sub-domain for two
reasons:

 1) To avoid name collisions.
 2) Because every other server uses sub-domains and we try to follow the
community practices as much as possible.

It's a bummer that JID's weren't constructed to deal with this
sub-domain issue from the beginning. For example, they could have been
in the form:

node/<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">service at server.com</A>

This would work great since &quot;/&quot; is already a prohibited character in
nodes.

I don't think pre-fixes are a reasonable general approach, though. Let's
say that a new service is invented as a JEP called &quot;foobar&quot;. You could
then mandate that any JID pre-pended with &quot;foobar-&quot; belongs to that
service on your example.com server. But, what if there's some
unfortunate person on your server named Foobar Smith that already has
the JID <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">foobar-smith at example.com</A>? It's just not possible to anticipate
all name conflicts unless we agreed on some format to restrict nodes
using some specific format. I don't see how that would be possible
without adding in some restrictions that aren't part of the XMPP RFC's,
but I'm open to ideas.

Regards,
Matt
