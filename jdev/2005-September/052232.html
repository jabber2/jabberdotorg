This really sounds like a bad idea to me. This implies that in the case of user 
error, for example a user who tries to connect to a service such as 
conference.uct.ac.za, a JM server will try to resolve and connect to uct.ac.za 
and then ac.za ? Just moving up the tree isn't a reasonable assumption.

Instead of 1 NXDOMAIN dns lookup result, you have either 3 failed lookups, or 
perhaps worse, 2 failed connection attempts to resolvable addresses which have 
no jabber servers running there, or perhaps completely unrelated servers (in 
which case the failure gets even messier).

This is bad engineering i.t.o. creating undesirable impact on the broader Internet.

Stephen
