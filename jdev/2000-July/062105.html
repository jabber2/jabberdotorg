you don't want to use digest authentication.

For the record, LDAP could support any number of different 
authentication schemes, such as SSL client certificates, CRAM-
MD5 &amp; Kerberos. 

&gt;<i>

</I>It would if you want to do Jabber digest authentication. However, I'd 
never allow this in my LDAP server. And while LDAP can store 
multiple passwords in an entry (in a number of different formats if 
you want :), this problem is going to be there when you try to 
integrate jabber with any other authentication system. Outside of 
homegrown authentication systems (such as what Jabber uses by 
default), nobody stores their passwords in plaintext in the 
password database.

</I>
You have this procedure right (and at least the hooks for eventually 
adding SSL are already there in Jabber, just nobody has 
implemented it yet) :).

However, Stunnel works on UNIX and Windows ;). 

SSL is a much better solution because it's a known standard &amp; 
would encrypt the entire session, not just the password. If you're 
using Jabber to do company meetings, you should want the entire 
conversation encrypted, not just the password (then again people 
make business decisions via email all of the time &amp; that's not 
usually encrypted ;). It also would protect the password during user 
registration, which digest authentication does not do (thus IMHO, 
it's not really any more secure than traditional authentication 
because it can be sniffed during registration)

Eventually if SSL support was built in (e.g. not just stunnel)  to the 
client, then you could add in SSL client certificates which would 
allow for a much more secure form of authentication.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;sheath and I are going to concentrate on getting the plaintext
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;authentication to work first and worry about the digest password
