<PRE>Schuyler, thanks for the excellent reply.

I don't quite follow the answer re the &quot;Who is watching me&quot; question though:

I understand that I can check each member of my roster to see if they are
subscribed to my presence, but what about people who are not on my roster.
If I have my account set to authorise everyone automatically, then after a
while  I won't have everyone who has added me to their contact list also
added to mine, therefore checking my &quot;roster&quot; would only return a subset of
people who are currently subscribed to my presence information.  I would
like a query that returned everyone.  Am I missing something?

Also I suspect that the encryption standard is moving too slowly.  There are
many clients currently being written, and as yet i am still to find on that
supports encryption.  Unless each client supports the same encryption
standard from day one, then it is going to end up as a an optional feature,
and hardly anyone will use it (like email) and once again each message will
be there in plain text for anyone with a packet sniffer to read.  It is bad
news just because of the insecure systems that the transports connect to -
not much we can do about that though.  So much for being able to rely on
jabber to send creditcard details etc for online shopping etc.  :(

The mod_filter sounds great.  I would like to be able to be &quot;available&quot; to
my workmates and &quot;N/A&quot; to friends and family sometimes when I am logged on
from work.

Thanks,

Michael.

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A few general questions that I have been wondering about for a while.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If this is documented somewhere and I have missed it, feel free to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point me in the right direction...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org">http://docs.jabber.org</A> has a lot of info.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Is there any support in the Jabber protocol to do a &quot;Who is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; watching me&quot; query?  This would return a list of users who are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receiving your presence online (or who have subscribed to your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presence, even if they are not line at the time).  I think this would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be a great security feature, and something that ICQ has always been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lacking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Yep.  But you don't need to do a special query, it's all in your roster.
</I>&gt;<i> Look at <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/jpg/refiqroster.html">http://docs.jabber.org/jpg/refiqroster.html</A> (Roster) and http:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="file://docs.jabber.org/jpg/refitem.html">file://docs.jabber.org/jpg/refitem.html</A> (Roster items).  The
</I>&gt;<i> 'subscription' attribute contains this info.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Is there any way in the process of adding someone to your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; roster/requesting a subscription to find out what their nickname is?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know there is a nickname field in the vCard, but for most of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clients I have seen you have to make up a nickname when you are adding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone.  Is there an elegant way to handle this?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Clients should do a vCard lookup and use the nickname field as the
</I>&gt;<i> default.  But some clients don't support vCard yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Has anyone come up with a standard client-to-client encryption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard that is recommended for each client to support?  I believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encryption is left up to the client, but I am very worried that unless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is coordinated it will result in the same insecure incompatible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mess that we currently have with email encryption systems.  I seem to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remember (from years ago) that the original vCard spec included a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; field for a public key of some sort.  If we could use this to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement a PGP (style) encryption method that would be very nice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe someone could point us to some standard Win32 libraries so that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we are all using the same method.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Not yet, but we are working on doing this and PGP is a definite
</I>possibility.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) Is it possible to implement an &quot;Invisible&quot; mode like ICQ's?  Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am doing something wrong, but if I connect and just don't send an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Available to the server, I can still send messages fine but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seem to receive any until I go back Available again.  Presumably the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server holds onto the message until it thinks you are ready to read
</I>it...
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, use a jabber:iq:filter query (mod_filter).  But mod_filter is post
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 and not &quot;officially&quot; supported yet.
</I>&gt;<i> This  allows you to create a set of rules, that are stored on the
</I>&gt;<i> server, to filter/redirect presence and messages.  You could add a rule
</I>&gt;<i> that will prevent your presence from being sent to a single user, a
</I>&gt;<i> group, or all.  So 'invisibility' in Jabber is achieved by filtering
</I>&gt;<i> presence, not a special status mode.  AFAIK, the only mod_filter
</I>&gt;<i> documentation that exists right now are the comments in the source.
</I>&gt;<i>
