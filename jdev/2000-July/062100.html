<PRE>Hi,
sheath and I have been talking about the LDAP-Jabber integration 
project.

What I failed to realize was that authentication happens in 
mod_auth* (e.g. mod_auth, mod_auth_sha1). I thought it all 
happened in xdb.

What sheath failed to realize was that most LDAP servers don't 
store passwords in plaintext.

There's nobody to blame on this because this is still foreign 
territory :). 

This isn't a problem when we're dealing with plaintext Jabber 
authentication (we can use the method described in the current 
design document). 

It is a problem for Jabber's digest mode. 

The way Jabber's digest mode works is :
client sends SHA-1 digested password 
server gets plaintext password from database (via an xdb module) 
server creates its own SHA-1 digest using the same mechanism 
as the client (by concating the SID and password together first and 
then creating the digest). 

This can't work with LDAP because most LDAP servers store their 
passwords pre-encrypted via DES, SHA-1 or some other 
mechanism.

What sheath and I have thought for now (but we're very open to 
suggestions) is that we could create a new objectclass and 
attribute for Jabber to be added to the LDAP server for sites that 
wished to use Jabber's digest mode. We could ship the schema 
with the code &amp; user's could add the Jabber schema to their 
server's schema before setting up xdbldap. 

This new schema would be;
objectclass: jabberuserobject
attribute:jabberpassword

Then when an user wanted to activate Jabber, they would send 
their password to the server during registration. The necessary 
objectclass would be added to the user's account &amp; their plaintext 
password would be stored to the server. We would have to 
authenticate them to the LDAP server first, unless it was a new 
LDAP entry because you wouldn't want someone else to get a 
jabber account using an userid that wasn't them (e.g. bob smith 
activatng his jabber account on Mark Wilcox's LDAP entry). 

The downside is that now the user's LDAP password is now stored 
in the directory in plaintext. As an LDAP server administrator I 
wouldn't want that (more importantly, my boss wouldn't let me do it 
anyway).

Optionally we could ask the user to send 2 passwords during 
registration, 1 is their LDAP password to authenticate to the server 
and the 2nd their jabber password (which we could make sure is 
different), but that's not good either, becuase most people want 
LDAP authentication so that they don't have multiple passwords.

The other option is to not enable jabber digest authentication and if 
people want to secure passwords, then use SSL. 

sheath and I are going to concentrate on getting the plaintext 
authentication to work first and worry about the digest password 
later.

looking for options...
