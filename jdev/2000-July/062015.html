<PRE>Danke, Arne! ;)

(That is the extent of my German, by the way.)

I'd be willing to give my opinions and such towards your project and at 
least point you to resources I might be familiar with. But, unfortunately 
I'm swamped with my own Jabber ideas along with the work (I should be doing 
right now) that actually pays the bills.

Ah, such is the merry life...

So I can't offer any real coding time on my part. Sorry. But take a look at 
those sites I mentioned. I think you'll be able to accomplish much in a 
simple client app without the need to create new extensions to the Jabber 
server.

Also, you might take a look at <A HREF="http://www.rogerwilco.com/">http://www.rogerwilco.com/</A>

Roger Wilco is a standalone app that does exactly what you are talking 
about. *Many* people in the gaming community use it as a means to 
communicate while playing MMORPG (Massively Multiuser Online Role Playing 
Games) and other types of online games. Once again, I believe you could use 
Jabber as the means for individuals to find one another and create a client 
that launches Roger Wilco appropriately for real-time communications.

Good luck!

</I>You are the first one who really understood my idea :-D
Would you be willing to help me with that?
