<PRE>&gt;<i>  &gt; SSL for Server-to-server is a very problematic issue, though. Either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  we force to use *only* SSL connections, but this is unrealistic. Or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  we allow both, but then we can as well not use SSL as well, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  the user can never know if his data is only submitted via a secure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  route...
</I>&gt;<i>The proper route is to only use SSL. Once the RSA patent expires
</I>&gt;<i>in the US in September, this will be easier to accomplish. The IETF
</I>&gt;<i>is now not approving any new protocols that aren't secure.
</I>
That are good news indeed! I was not aware of the patent expiring so soon.



&gt;<i>I don't think so. It only costs money to get a Verisign signed cert.
</I>&gt;<i>The last time I checked openSSL included the master certs for
</I>&gt;<i>most of the major CAs.
</I>
Ah yes, I just found them. To be true, my first SSL support was kind 
of a hack, I looked at the examples and tried to copy what they do. 
Unfortunatly, I looked at an example that doesn't use certs, that's 
why I at first overlooked it all. I'll see how I can incorporate them 
in mac-like fashion.



&gt;<i>  &gt; As I stated above, I added SSL (using OpenSSL 0.9.5a) to my client.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  In fact, to do this, I reactived the (abandoned) Macintosh port of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  OpenSSL :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  But I lack knowledge of SSL :-(. I will have to dig into the docs...
</I>&gt;<i>While I'm not an SSL programmer, I have a pretty good
</I>&gt;<i>understanding of the protocol (I've been issuing &amp; managing SSL
</I>&gt;<i>certificats for nearly 4 years). If you have questions, you can send
</I>&gt;<i>them to me and I'll try to help.
</I>
Thank you very much, mark, that is very kind!


&gt;<i>BTW It would really rock if you could get Stunnel to compile on a
</I>&gt;<i>Mac. :)
</I>
I'm not sure this is easily possible. I know that there are one or 
two commercial apps for the mac that implement SSL tunneling. But I'm 
not sure a straight port is possible... But then, I dunno how stunnel 
on unix/windows works, I can't judge it before looking at the 
source/docs.

I'm trying to get the OpenSSL app to compile currently. I'll have to 
&quot;emulate&quot; some timing functions it seems.


&gt;<i>I have the basic SSL outline at
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://developer.iplanet.com/viewsource/wilcox_protect/wilcox_prote">http://developer.iplanet.com/viewsource/wilcox_protect/wilcox_prote</A>
</I>&gt;<i>ct.html
</I>
Thanks, this article was helpful.


&gt;<i>There's also a good book &quot;SSL and TLS Essentials&quot; by Stepehn
</I>&gt;<i>Thomas.
</I>
I'' check it out, thanks.


&gt;<i>You might also want to look at the IO::SSL module in Perl because
</I>&gt;<i>it has the verify code in it, which is all that it sounds like you're
</I>&gt;<i>missing.
</I>
OK.



Thanks for your help,


Max
