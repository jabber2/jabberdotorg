<PRE>Hi Michael,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few general questions that I have been wondering about for a while.
</I>&gt;<i> If this is documented somewhere and I have missed it, feel free to 
</I>&gt;<i> point me in the right direction...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I><A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org">http://docs.jabber.org</A> has a lot of info.
&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is there any support in the Jabber protocol to do a &quot;Who is 
</I>&gt;<i> watching me&quot; query?  This would return a list of users who are 
</I>&gt;<i> receiving your presence online (or who have subscribed to your 
</I>&gt;<i> presence, even if they are not line at the time).  I think this would 
</I>&gt;<i> be a great security feature, and something that ICQ has always been 
</I>&gt;<i> lacking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yep.  But you don't need to do a special query, it's all in your roster.
Look at <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/jpg/refiqroster.html">http://docs.jabber.org/jpg/refiqroster.html</A> (Roster) and http: 
//docs.jabber.org/jpg/refitem.html (Roster items).  The
'subscription' attribute contains this info.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Is there any way in the process of adding someone to your 
</I>&gt;<i> roster/requesting a subscription to find out what their nickname is?  
</I>&gt;<i> I know there is a nickname field in the vCard, but for most of the 
</I>&gt;<i> clients I have seen you have to make up a nickname when you are adding 
</I>&gt;<i> someone.  Is there an elegant way to handle this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Clients should do a vCard lookup and use the nickname field as the 
default.  But some clients don't support vCard yet.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Has anyone come up with a standard client-to-client encryption 
</I>&gt;<i> standard that is recommended for each client to support?  I believe 
</I>&gt;<i> encryption is left up to the client, but I am very worried that unless 
</I>&gt;<i> this is coordinated it will result in the same insecure incompatible 
</I>&gt;<i> mess that we currently have with email encryption systems.  I seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> remember (from years ago) that the original vCard spec included a 
</I>&gt;<i> field for a public key of some sort.  If we could use this to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement a PGP (style) encryption method that would be very nice.  
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe someone could point us to some standard Win32 libraries so that 
</I>&gt;<i> we are all using the same method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Not yet, but we are working on doing this and PGP is a definite possibility.
&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Is it possible to implement an &quot;Invisible&quot; mode like ICQ's?  Maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> I am doing something wrong, but if I connect and just don't send an 
</I>&gt;<i> Available to the server, I can still send messages fine but I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> seem to receive any until I go back Available again.  Presumably the 
</I>&gt;<i> server holds onto the message until it thinks you are ready to read it...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes, use a jabber:iq:filter query (mod_filter).  But mod_filter is post 
1.0 and not &quot;officially&quot; supported yet.
This  allows you to create a set of rules, that are stored on the 
server, to filter/redirect presence and messages.  You could add a rule 
that will prevent your presence from being sent to a single user, a 
group, or all.  So 'invisibility' in Jabber is achieved by filtering 
presence, not a special status mode.  AFAIK, the only mod_filter 
documentation that exists right now are the comments in the source.
