Yes. Whenever someone subscribes to your presence, he will be put 
*automatically* onto your roster
Whenever you remove someone from you roster, he will be unsubscribed 
*automaticlly*

In fact, due to the way the sytem works, it is *impossible* for 
someone to be subscribed to your presence not to be on your roster. 
Being subscribed always means being on the roster. No exception. This 
is on purpose.

I agree that a commons system is needed. We work on a standard for 
this, and will hopefully release more information on it soon.

However, this is not as easy as &quot;just adding encryption&quot; to it. There 
are many pitfalls and trouble spots. It is possible, though.

</I>
You touch a sport here: communication with other IM systems, like 
ICQ, AIM. As these don't support encrypted messages, they won't be 
able to read yours, so you have to chat with them in plain text. 
Nothing we can do about that.



Bye,

Max
