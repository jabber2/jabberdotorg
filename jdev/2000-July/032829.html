<PRE>There will shortly be an iq:pki that is proposed, I will see that the URL to
the proposal gets on the list for others to view.  This is essentially a 
wrapper iq for PGP.

I believe the other guys got your other questions.

&gt;<i> A few general questions that I have been wondering about for a while.
</I>&gt;<i> If this is documented somewhere and I have missed it, feel free to point me in the right direction...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is there any support in the Jabber protocol to do a &quot;Who is watching me&quot; query?  This would return a list of users who are receiving your presence online (or who have subscribed to your presence, even if they are not line at the time).  I think this would be a great security feature, and something that ICQ has always been lacking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Is there any way in the process of adding someone to your roster/requesting a subscription to find out what their nickname is?  I know there is a nickname field in the vCard, but for most of the clients I have seen you have to make up a nickname when you are adding someone.  Is there an elegant way to handle this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Has anyone come up with a standard client-to-client encryption standard that is recommended for each client to support?  I believe encryption is left up to the client, but I am very worried that unless this is coordinated it will result in the same insecure incompatible mess that we currently have with email encryption systems.  I seem to remember (from years ago) that the original vCard spec included a field for a public key of some sort.  If we could use this to implement a PGP (style) encryption method that would be very nice.  Maybe someone could point us to some standard Win32 libraries so that we are all using the same method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Is it possible to implement an &quot;Invisible&quot; mode like ICQ's?  Maybe I am doing something wrong, but if I connect and just don't send an Available to the server, I can still send messages fine but I don't seem to receive any until I go back Available again.  Presumably the server holds onto the message until it thinks you are ready to read it...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
