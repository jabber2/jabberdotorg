<PRE>Hi,

sheath and I think we have figured out a solution to the problem (at 
least for now).

For sites that wish to use Jabber digest authentication, they will 
need to make sure that their user's passwords are stored in LDAP 
as plaintext.

It is probably recommended that if you want to do this or if you plan 
to use LDAP for authentication beyond Jabber, that you use a 
seperate LDAP server for this purpose (sort of like you would have 
done if you had run Microsoft NetMeeting &amp; the ILS server). You 
can probably use LDAP replication to make it easier to keep user 
data in synch (but not passwords).

The reason I recommend this is so that you don't have to figure out 
how to store both plaintext and encrypted passwords in the same 
server (most LDAP servers can support multiple passwords in the 
userpassword attribute, but it's not wise). 

Most sites will not have multiple servers. I figure most sites that 
wish to use digest authentication, will likely won't mind either 
storing the passwords in plaintext or setting up a jabber specific 
LDAP server (after all it's still better than maintaining plaintext 
passwords in a text file like we currently do).

It's also observed that the future is likely SSL because that's an 
Internet recognized standard, jabber already can support it (at least 
on the server, still waiting for those clients ;), it provides for secure 
authentication of both the server &amp; the client. Plus it encrypts the 
entire conversation(s), not just the password exchange.

I've put these changes in the updated design document at
