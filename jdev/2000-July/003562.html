<PRE>A couple of questions regarding resources:

Is there any way in Jabber to look up a list of resources that a person has
defined, or are you just limited to seeing what ones they are online with at
the time?

For example, say I come across a URL I think a friend may be interested in
seeing.  I know he is at work at right now (he is logged on as
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/work say) and won't have time to read it until he gets
home.  I want to send it to him at home so it is waiting for him, but I
don't know his home resource.  It could be <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/home or it
could be <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/StanleySt etc).  He has not left his home
computer logged onto Jabber.  Is there anyway I could find out?  Ideally I
would like to have a picklist with all the resources that a person uses
available when someone is sending a message.

Also, I assume there is nothing to stop you from sending messages to
yourself at a different resource?  (Or at the same resource?)

Another thing - I understand that the Jabber ID's and resources are not case
sensitive, however I have a problem if I send a time/client version query to
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/winjab when they are logged on as
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/Winjab - a query error service unavailable is returned.
Is this something in Jabber, or maybe a client error?  Also, I don't
understand why I can't send a time/client version query to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>
and have a valid result returned.  Surely it should just go to the resource
with the highest priority?  Again, it returns a querty error.

Thanks,

Michael.
