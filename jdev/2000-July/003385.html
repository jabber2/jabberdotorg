<PRE>Hi,

I have been trying to install a Jabber server on a Solaris machine and have 
had some trouble getting things working.  Basically, it works when I send the 
password in the clear, but when I tell the client to use digest passwords 
(which we really want to do), it does not work.  We get a 401 Unauthorized 
message back from the server.  I ran the server in debug mode, but I couldn't 
pinpoint what exactly was failing.  I'd be happy to send traces of the XML 
that went back and forth if that would help you out at all.  Secondly, I need 
to install the groupchat feature and can't seem to get it to build correctly.  
It is having some error with the pth library, even though the jabber server 
built correctly with pth.  Once again, I'd be happy to send debug information 
to you if it would help you figure out what the problem is.

Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

-jared
