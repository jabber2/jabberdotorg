<PRE>Hello all,
I got a quick and easy question for you -- I'm starting to develop a client
(yes I know another really isn't needed, but its embedded in another system
so its a long story), and was wondering whether it is ok to test my client
while in development against jabber.org.  I know its a development system,
but since an in-progress client is probably going to be sending out bad
packets (at one point or another), I just wanted to make sure it was okay to
do this.  Otherwise, I'll have to try and track down a linux box that I can
run the server on.
Thanks,
Matt
