</I>Once we get LDAP support added and your server has the 
necessary support, then the necessity of user registration will be 
minimized if your users already are in LDAP.

Then their nicknames can become whatever LDAP attribute you 
wish it to be (e.g. it could be their uid or their name).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe someone could point us to some standard Win32 libraries so that

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Not yet, but we are working on doing this and PGP is a definite possibility.
</I>It should be possible to support multiple encryption standards. 
VCard has been built to support more X509 (SSL certificates) than 
PGP, though this is not required. 

Probably best bet will be for Jabber to default to X509 (there's more 
infrastructure now to support X509 than PGP such as Verisign, 
Entrust, openCA,etc) but allow for optional encodings via the TYPE 
parameter in the KEY attribute.

e.g.:
KEY;PGP:=BASE64_PGP

KEY;X509:=PEM (for PEM encoded X509, this is like BASE64 
accept that it has a header &amp; footer lines liek &quot;BEGIN 
CERTIFICATE&quot;) 

That's standard VCARD, I'm not sure how the XML will look like 
perhaps;
&lt;key type=&quot;PEM&quot;&gt;
....
&lt;/key&gt;
