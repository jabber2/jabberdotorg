<PRE>You know, I think had the same problem but I'm having a hell of a time remembering exactly how I solved it... It was nearly a month ago but as I recall it was something to do  with the makefile only looking in a standard directory and in the directory in which the library was actually installed.  The problem is I can't even remember for sure whether it was pth, adns, or xode that gave me the problem but it definitely only occurred with groupchat.

Hmm.. that ended up being less useful than I intended &lt;g&gt;.  With luck it may guide you in the right direction to finding the problem.  If not and no one else can jump in, I'll go back and try compiling again from scratch and see if it jogs my memory.

Cheers,
Julian
