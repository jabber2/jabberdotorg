<PRE>there is a jabber client or two that use command line only interface.. jabberx i think is one of them, included in the libjabber (i *think*) or bitchX and svc_irc works good (/server jabber.org) (it'll work even better when updated to 1.1)  there is also a svc_telnet (not sure which port it listens on) that you can telnet to a jabber server to get a text interface... all these are valid &quot;no gui&quot; options...

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;transport&quot; that has a nice ANSI graphical interface for use from the bash
</I>&gt;<i> prompt (telnet localhost $JABBERPORT) and maybe a mechanism like an IRC
</I>&gt;<i> server for users of differing clients to all use a common channel to have a
</I>&gt;<i> group discussion.  The channel would just be a set of identities from all of
</I>&gt;<i> the participating users' servers which are allocated as needed from a set of
</I>&gt;<i> ICQ numbers and AOL &quot;screen names&quot; and similar Yahoo and MSN devices.  Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> I can just use the IRC transport with BitchX or something, but the telnet
</I>&gt;<i> transport seems like a good idea that shouldn't be too complicated to
</I>&gt;<i> implement.  I look forward to your suggestions and comments, but I may not
</I>&gt;<i> check my email again until Sunday evening.  In the meantime, this is
</I>&gt;<i> Jonathan Conrad, and I am rebooting to RedHat...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, are there any other pieces of Open Source software that may
</I>&gt;<i> allow me to use ICQ in Linux, especially without using X?
