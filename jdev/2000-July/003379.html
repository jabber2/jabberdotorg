    I consider that a kludge.  Not only does it not work on FreeBSD, it
requires you to be root.  I never build (or run) jabber as root, and I
don't endorse a policy that recommends this.  jserver and the transports
don't need root privilege for any reason; they don't bind to low ports,
and they don't read the shadow password file.  They especially don't need
root privilege to _build_.

    Following are a series of workarounds coupled with complaints.  I
will be happy to supply patches, now that I know that at least two of
us are building on FreeBSD.  ;^)

    Enough with the proselytizing, here's how I build jserver and the
transports on FreeBSD (3.4-RELEASE):

    I install everything with a prefix of /usr/local/jabber&lt;something&gt;.
This allows me to build and compare multiple versions, and it lets me
delete an entire build just by saying, e.g.,

        % rm -fr /usr/local/jabber-experiment

    For an example, I'll build a version under /usr/local/jabbertest.

    First of all, there are some things that I had to do once and only
once.  I installed the gmake and openssl ports:

        % su
        % cd /usr/ports/dev/gmake
        % make install
        % cd /usr/ports/security/openssl
        % make install

    Then I made a symlink from /usr/local/bin/make to /usr/local/bin/gmake,
and put /usr/local/bin in my $PATH before /usr/bin.  This is because
jabber depends on GNU make, and right now there's no way to redefine
MAKE easily in jabber's autogen scripts.

    Now, we're past the one-time-only actions.  For a particular jserver
build, I create the directory, and point some environment variables in
that direction (n.b.:  the -L/usr/local/lib and -I/usr/local/include are
for the openssl port I installed above):

            % mkdir /usr/local/jabbertest
            % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/jabbertest/lib
            % export LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/usr/local/jabbertest/lib -L/usr/local/lib&quot;
            % export CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/usr/local/jabbertest/include \
                               -I/usr/local/include&quot;
            % export PATH=&quot;/usr/local/jabbertest/bin:$PATH&quot;

    Then, I autogen build, test, and install each part, giving the
appropriate prefix:
    
            % ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/jabbertest
            % make
            % make check    # Ignore failure, as appropriate
            % make test     # Ignore failure, as appropriate
            % make install

    After autogenning and before making jabber-transport, I hand-edit
jabber-transport/src/Makefile.  Change the `LIBS =' line from:

            LIBS = -lpth -lnsl -ldl

    to:

            LIBS = -lpth -L/usr/local/lib -lssl -lcrypto -lRSAglue -lrsaref

    Otherwise, it's a textbook build.  Comments and questions are welcomed.

    Peace,
