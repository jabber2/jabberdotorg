<PRE>Hello
This morning i read an Article about Internet-telephony and i had an idea:
Ithink it would be easy to extend the protocol of jabber to make speech- 
transport possible
My idea was this:
If i wanted to talk to my cousin Anna (she would have to be online and 
logged into jabber) i would click on a button on my (modified) Jabber- 
Client.
My client would then send a special  message to her client using 
standard message-transport.
The message would include my ip-adress (and prefered portnumber) and the 
types (and versions) of voicecodecs installed on my System (which are 
capable of streaming).
If Anna decided to take my call, all she would have to do is pressing 
the receive-button on her (allso modifiede) client and it would send a 
similar message to mine.
Now a streamingprotocoll is chosen wich is available on both clients (if 
more than one the one with the best quality / bps ratio is chosen out of 
a sorted list)
Now the only thing that would have to be done is open two audiostreams 
and start sending / receiving.
As a start maybe one audiocodec would be enough.
I would suggest ogg-vorbis, for it`s as good as mp3 and its (afaik) GPLed.
If i sent this message to the wrong place would you please be so kind to 
forward it to someone who might answer it.
(please excuse my bad english. As you will have guessed i'm not a native 
speaker ;-)
Arne
