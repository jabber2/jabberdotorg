<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; A transport typically requires a user to login (either by doing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; registration or sending presence to the transport). After the login, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sends available presence for the foreign network entities that the user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is subscribed to (assuming they're online).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is if my server stops, then any already logged in user
</I>&gt;<i> still appears online to the transport.
</I>
Your server should be sending unavailables if it stops, and if it crashes
should probably do that on startup to clear everything up.

&gt;<i> Once my server starts again,
</I>&gt;<i> and the user reconnects I need to know the state of all their
</I>&gt;<i> contacts. Sending an online presence to the transport server does not
</I>&gt;<i> cause their contact states to be resent (since they were already
</I>&gt;<i> considered as online). So I thought probing their states would help. I
</I>&gt;<i> also tried sending an unavailable, immediately followed by an online
</I>&gt;<i> message to the transport in the hope it would resend all their contact
</I>&gt;<i> states. This only served to confuse the transport with it not always
</I>&gt;<i> paying attention to the order I send the requests in and the result
</I>&gt;<i> being that the user ends up appearing offline to the transport. My
</I>&gt;<i> current plan is to wait a few seconds between sending the unavailable
</I>&gt;<i> and online status messages again, but that seems to be more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated than it needs to be just to request the states of all
</I>&gt;<i> contacts. Is there any other way to request the state of all contacts
</I>&gt;<i> other than using individual probes for each contact?
</I>
No, only logging off and then back on.

Richard
