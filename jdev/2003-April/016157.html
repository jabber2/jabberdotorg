Yes, you can. Although, if you have the user's login (say they user is
identified on the site already), then why not have them log into that
account? If you're talking about who to route information to on the backend
(the sales reps) you can probably use standard Jabber routing. Just have
them start a chat with <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">sales at company.com.</A>

Jabber will route according to highest priority session connected to that
account. So agents can all log into that same account with different
resources and then adjust their presence priorities to affect routing. If
you can change the server routing behavior, you can customize this routing
behavior. We (Jive Software) are working on this exact scenario with our
server so that incoming chats can be routed to the best agent based on a
wide variety of criteria and custom rules since basic presence priority
based routing is insufficient for large numbers of customers, chats and
agents.

&gt;<i> As for a servlet, you mean, use JSP or ASP? Do you have any sample code that
</I>&gt;<i> does that?
</I>
Yup, with Java it would be JSPs (or velocity/struts/webwork, or whatever
you're using). There are several people discussing how to do this with Smack
on our discussion forums:

<A HREF="http://www.jivesoftware.com/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=39">http://www.jivesoftware.com/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=39</A>

I don't want to take up bandwidth here with it since it's smack specific.
Theoretically you should also be able to use another Java library like
Jabberbeans to do it as well (but I'm partial to Smack!) :)
