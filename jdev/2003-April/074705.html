<PRE>The Jabber protocol could probably be used for what you describe, but
it's not going to be very robust compared to a Message Queuing product.
It's also going to be a whole lot of work. 

The jabber protocol doesn't support transactions, doesn't support true
guaranteed delivery, and has no concept of a permanent message store.

You're much better off using an off-the-shelf Message Queuing product.
There are a number on the market that you should be able to use from
both C# and Java (MSMQ springs to mind immediately). If you go with
MSMQ, you could use QueuedComponents to achieve the push functionality
you're looking for. 

I think all the major vendors sell tools such as this (IBM, See Beyond,
Microsoft, etc).

Subject: [JDEV] Some quick questions?

I am currently working on a project that requires xml messages to be 
pushed from a server to a client and xml messages from the client to the

server?  The client is a c# .net desktop client, the server is a java 
server.  I had looked at soap but they do not have push functionality! 
I looked JMS but it does not have xml as an option, unless using stream 
text, also c# support is not the best, and is expensive.

I found the Jabber protocol.  The project I am working on is not for 
instant messaging, it will be for message delivery between client and 
server.    Does jabber provide Guaranteed delivery, and if the client is

down queuing of messages, and mass send upon reconnect?
I noticed the ID tag in the message element, could this allow for unique

  messages numbering so I can rerequest previous messages, if the 
connection is dropped?

I was wondering if Jabber could be used for this?

Sorry for all the questions but I have been looking around and have not 
found a protocol yet, and would prefer to not have to write my own.
