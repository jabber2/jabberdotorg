Jabberd does offline storage and delivery at next login. I think it 
would take some modification to be able to request certain messge IDs. 
They are there because the Jabber protocol is asynchronous. I believe 
what you are talking about would requiring the packets being stored 
permanently. You could have a component which intercepts all packets and 
stores them in a database, and will retrieve them upon request, but they 
may not all make sense independently.

At it's heart Jabberd just routes xml fragments between entities, so you 
should be able to do all the things you're looking for

&gt;<i> I was wondering if Jabber could be used for this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for all the questions but I have been looking around and have not 
</I>&gt;<i> found a protocol yet, and would prefer to not have to write my own.
