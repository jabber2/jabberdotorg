First, I think you need to read the specifications more closely. They
clearly say that the 'id' SHOULD be returned, and if you simply looked
at debug output from the jabberd server you'd know that it always does
so (yes, maybe I need to change that to MUST in the spec). Second, you 
say that you have yet to figure out how to create accounts in Exodus, 
but it is quite simple, described even in the Jabber User Guide for end
users (not server devs!). Third, I have no idea how you got the
impression that only the server is allowed to set ID attributes, nowhere
does it say that in the specs, in fact it says exactly the opposite for
IDs on stanzas (streams are another story). If you're going to write a
server, you're going to need to learn to read the specs very very
carefully, otherwise there's no way you are going to pass the upcoming
compliance tests. Just a friendly word of advice.
