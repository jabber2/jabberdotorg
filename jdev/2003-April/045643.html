<PRE>Ok, replying to the many posts.

1) &quot;you're going to need to learn to read the specs very very

carefully&quot;

	Now on the specs, recently, they have become much better from what they were, but still need work.  I was working on a very old copy of the specs (Aug. 2002)  and because of this, I have missed many of the chenges to the standered.  Only since I started testing with Gaim have I realy started to see the changes.  It is quite possible that I just missed the strength they ment with this issue.  

2)&quot;Urgh. :/&quot;
	Even though it seems to conflict with the last statment, I do get postings from the xmppwg, so I just posted one of the most articulet of these messages over there.

3)&quot;join the jabberd2 effort&quot;
	Now, now this issue.  I looked into this when I started, back in Aug '02.  There was nothing I could join, with my skill set, and end requirments.  While more projects have come up since then, what are we up to now, 7-10?  Not including the pay stuff.  I started Rica in the Open Source, scratch your own itch mannor.  I am now so far, that I am not sure I could feel comfortable abandoning my baby.  You understand.  Besides, when I get done, I have a few things planed, that I dout anyone has thought of.  Trust me, you'll like it.

If there is anything I missed, please let me know.  I hope I have not offended anyone with these postings.  If I have I am sorry, and hope to help in anyway I can.
Matt
