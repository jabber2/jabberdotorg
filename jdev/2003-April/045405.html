<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Your server should be sending unavailables if it stops, and if it
</I>crashes
&gt;<i> &gt; should probably do that on startup to clear everything up.
</I>&gt;<i> It should but it doesn't..
</I>
Well then it sounds like its a problem with your server implementation not
jabberd or the protocol.

&gt;<i> This is my primary annoyance with Jabber. It happens to me all the time
</I>&gt;<i> that I see people online/offline when they aren't. The roster and the
</I>&gt;<i> 'real' contactlist are out of sync a large part of the time. Especially
</I>&gt;<i> when my connection to jabber.org gets dropped these problems start to
</I>&gt;<i> appear. Of course I can notice that I only see Jabber people online so
</I>&gt;<i> in that case I either explicitly logoff from the MSN transport and then
</I>&gt;<i> logon again. When I do this I get the complete list of online users
</I>&gt;<i> again. If I do nothing I only get the updates which means that I only
</I>&gt;<i> see people online that came online after I reconnected to jabber.org
</I>
Connection gets dropped?? How do you mean??, if you mean the s2s connection
gets dropped then thats fine, its supposed to be able to, and if jabberd has
more messages that arrive after the connection is dropped it will connect to
you to deliver them as and when.

&gt;<i> IMO the MSN transport should receive status information from jabber.org
</I>&gt;<i> telling it that my connection dropped. Apparently that doesn't happen.
</I>
Huh??? But if you are talking about s2s then its not supposed to, in s2s it
is your responsibility to send the unavailable presence of users on your
server and if you server goes down, its not something wrong with the
protocol its you seeming to not follow it.

If you need any help with these issues I can help, I myself have developed a
corporate jabber server platform which is currently in testing.
