<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Huh??? But if you are talking about s2s then its not supposed to, in s2s
</I>it
&gt;<i> &gt; is your responsibility to send the unavailable presence of users on your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server and if you server goes down, its not something wrong with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol its you seeming to not follow it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am the person who originally raised this issue for our own custom
</I>&gt;<i> server (<A HREF="http://netwinsite.com/dbabble">http://netwinsite.com/dbabble</A>) that I am implementing the
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber protocol for. But I suspect the person you are replying to here
</I>&gt;<i> is actually referring to jabberd (not his/her own server
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.) From the quick test I ran, it seems jabberd does not
</I>&gt;<i> implement this properly and can easily get the status of users out of
</I>&gt;<i> sync with the transports when the server is restarted.
</I>
Sure but thats a problem with an implementation which can be fixed, but as
far as protocol is concerned there isnt really a problem.

&gt;<i> There are also other problems to do with the fact that the Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> protocol was not originally designed to have reliable message and
</I>&gt;<i> status delivery, but rather just intends to achieve message and status
</I>&gt;<i> delivery most of the time. This shows up when a user sends a message,
</I>&gt;<i> and a momentary problem with the network connection between 2 servers
</I>&gt;<i> means that the message is not delivered, but since the Jabber protocol
</I>&gt;<i> was not designed for message receipt acknowledgement the message can
</I>&gt;<i> just disappear with the sender thinking it has been sent, but the
</I>&gt;<i> recipient never actually receiving it. I realize there is a Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> enhancement proposal that suggests a way around this problem
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0040.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0040.html</A>). Do any Jabber server
</I>&gt;<i> implementations use this? Our own server protocol is designed to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure message delivery and user status notification is guaranteed in
</I>&gt;<i> all cases, and I find was was quite surprised to find the Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> protocol was never designed to ensure reliable message delivery in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place.
</I>
You dont need JEP40 to do reliable message delivery, you can just use the
standard message events this tells you various status's of messages, i.e.
delivered, stored offline, displayed etc.
