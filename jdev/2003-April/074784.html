<PRE>&gt;<i> It is the most obvious place to do IM, a collaboration suite, I have
</I>&gt;<i> looked at the code, and I have mixed feelings about it, although there
</I>&gt;<i> is the new version jabberd2, I sense that there is no direction other
</I>&gt;<i> than creating a SM XML parsing server, wish is a good thing and kudus
</I>&gt;<i> for Rob, especially doing it. But if you start looking to the specs you
</I>&gt;<i> get a feeling that it could be more, than it is. 
</I>
Well, thats currently where most of the (my) effort is being placed,
because thats where most of the demand is. However, the j2 SM is very
close to being a &quot;toolkit&quot; for writing Jabber-based services. (Almost,
because some of the session protocol code is still handled in the core -
I'm planning to move it into a module soon).

Example - I'm currently using the SM core to write a transport to a
local IM system. The transport is implemented as a normal SM module, and
the service makes use of the disco, version and time modules without any
modifications.

The SM core itself makes quite a few facilities available - XML parsing,
packet generation and distribution, presence tracking, access controls,
config files, logging, storage, etc etc.

So, anyone wanting to implement a new service can do it by implementing
a module that handles the details of the application. Granted, this can
mean there's still a large amount of work to do, especially in a complex
application, but at least you don't have to bother with all the utility
stuff that you'll need.

And yes, I know its not well documented - someday, perhaps it will be :)

Anyone who wants to play with this kind of thing, feel free to grab me
online and ask about it.

Rob.
