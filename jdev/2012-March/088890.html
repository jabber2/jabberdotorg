I've now started filling out the ideas page at
<A HREF="http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2012">http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2012</A>

When adding your project at the bottom, please use a consistent format
- this is what I've been using for the Swift ideas (example below):

[Project name (e.g. Swift)]
Description of software project. Must include details of how to find
the potential mentors to chat to.

{foreach idea}
[Idea name (e.g. Conversation History)]
Summary: [one-liner summary]
Difficulty: [e.g. Easy-Medium]
Details: [multi-line description of what's involved]

So that gives us something like:
== Swift ==
[<A HREF="http://swift.im">http://swift.im</A> Swift]'s goal is to provide an IM client that does
things 'right' with a good user interface, solid quality, and
standards-compliance. This year there are again several opportunities
for working on new functionality in Swift. This page lists some of the
high priority tasks the Swift development team has. If you're
interested in any of these (or other) Swift ideas, please jump into
the [xmpp:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">swift at rooms.swift.im</A>?join <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">swift at rooms.swift.im</A>] room and
chat it over with Remko and Kev. Swift is a C++ project, so C++
proficiency is required, with either knowledge of or willingness to
learn about unit testing (and ideally test-driven development).

=== Conversation History ===
* '''Summary''': Implement all aspects of keeping conversation
history, both local and remote.
* '''Difficulty''': Easy-Medium
* '''Details''': Swift doesn't currently store any transcripts. A
student would likely start by producing a prototype user interface for
accessing chat history, then write the library code to access a remote
archive, and plug these together and finally work on a local archive.
This is likely to be a very satisfying project, with enough challenge
to be interesting, but not so much that it's frustrating - plus it's a
very popular feature request.


I'd consider this the minimum necessary 'details' part - I'll be going
back to expand on these.

We need to have a good selection of projects up on the ideas page by
~middle of next week, I think, so please have at it.
