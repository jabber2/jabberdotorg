<PRE>Thanks (a ton - a ton times !! ) Waqas.

I really appreciate your efforts in trying to get the exact use-case.
Please find my comments inline.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is probably what I was looking for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just some minor queries ::
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once the proxies are setup (i.e. there is a link (Alice's WebDAV hosted
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;httpd&quot;) &lt;==&gt; (Tom's server) &lt;==&gt; (Bob's browser), then the
</I>&gt;<i> user-experience
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be the same as though Alice and Bob are on the same network, right?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, in the end it's just an HTTP proxy. The fact that there's a
</I>&gt;<i> tunnel and XMPP is invisible to the WebDAV user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is your general opinion on this approach? Would the amount and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complexity of the added code (proxy-setup) be worthwhile, than looking
</I>&gt;<i> for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible alternative like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;upload-files-to-central-server-and-then-download-from-there&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Depends on what you are actually trying to build. Do you need realtime
</I>&gt;<i> sync like Dropbox?
</I>

No. Just the ability for the client to access and download server's files,
according to client's comfort.






&gt;<i> Is WebDAV a requirement?
</I>

Hmm.. Not really. But this seems to be the best solution possible over FTP,
SFTP, FTPS.






&gt;<i> Can Bob run a custom
</I>&gt;<i> client?
</I>

He could. But my thinking is (I may be wrong though, please correct me if I
am wrong) that a browser has everything to handle this particular scenario.
So, there is no need to re-invent the wheel.







&gt;<i> Is the server having a copy of the files a good thing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, because we would be a working in a N-to-N environement, where any of
the N users are acting as servers, as well as clients. So each server puts
whatever she wants to share in her local share,






&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WebDAV isn't too great at realtime sync AFAIK.
</I>

Realtime sync is not required.






&gt;<i> And if Bob can run a
</I>&gt;<i> custom client, an end-to-end Jingle session between Bob and Alice
</I>&gt;<i> would be much better than tunneling through Tom's server, since that
</I>&gt;<i> saves bandwidth for the server, allows direct peer to peer transfers,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>

I did have a look into Jingle, but that is a server-initiated process,
right?
That would defeat the purpose of working according to client's comfort.








&gt;<i> If the server would want to keep a copy of everything anyway
</I>&gt;<i> (like it does in Dropbox's case), then
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;upload-files-to-central-server-and-then-download-from-there&quot; would be
</I>&gt;<i> better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, as I said we are working in a N-to-N environment. So, a central
server would be too much public (not to forget heavily loaded) with the
shares of all N users. Moreover, that would mean twice the storage space
(as far as the total eco-system is concerned).


I would love to get more feedback from you in due course of time.


Thanks, Thanks, Thanks.

Ajay
