Hey everyone,

My name is Jo&#227;o Paquim, and I'm working on my application for GSOC 2012.
I
 could use some tips from you guys, I'm having some difficulty choosing 
something to work on, I've spent some time looking at the Ideas list, 
but I can't help but feel a little lost. There are many things that 
would interest me, but I would need some guidance in preparing the 
application.  How many people regularly have their GSoC applications 
rejected?

Anyway, here's my preliminary application, please give me your insight on it ;) Also, what's a JID?

&quot;
About Me:

    My name is Jo&#227;o Paquim, I'm 18 years old and I live in Lisbon, Portugal.
    I'm a first year Aerospace Engineering student at IST, and I've been interested in programming for a couple of years now.
    I started out learning Python. I learned basic programming concepts, but stopped for some time, I can't really recall why.
    A year ago, I decided to try out Linux. I started with Ubuntu, jumped around between the different flavors and other distros based on it:
    Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Mint, among others. I resumed my Python learning, learning a bit of PyQt, and after some time decided to tackle C.
    During my first semester at the University, I had a class on programming (with C).
    I worked on a project (a game using the Allegro library) and finished the class with a grade of 19 (out of 20).
    On my free time, I learned C++, a bit of Common Lisp and Prolog, and some Bash scripting.
    I'm really kind of addicted to programming and the variety of languages out there ;)
    Nowadays, I'm using Arch Linux with KDE 4.8 as my main OS, I have been learning Qt for a couple of months and the KDE libs, git and x86 assembly for a couple of weeks.
    I haven't participated in GSoC before, and the only experience I've had working with a group has been the aforementioned project for the Programming class.


Abstract:



Contact details:

    main: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jonhypaquim at hotmail.com</A> 
    secondary: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jonhypaquim at gmail.com</A>


Schedule/Commitments:

    I'll have classes until 25/05, 6 tests from 2/06 until 15/06, and recovery exams from 23/06 until 29/06.
    I'll try to avoid the recovery exams, and even with all the tests, I'll still be pretty available during June.
    I have no obligations during July or August, however.

    In terms of schedule, I prefer to work in the afternoon and evening, to facilitate contact with people in the US (because of timezones).
    I also have no problem with working in the weekends, although I may occasionally be unable to do so.


Description:



Why:

    I've wanted to get involved with an open-source project for some time, but always found making the move a bit too mind-perplexing.
    GSOC makes this a lot easier, making the whole thing more comfortable when it comes to contacting the organizations, besides providing financial incentive.
    I want to know what it feels like to be a part of a large project, and take my software development skills to the real world.


Research:



Approach:



Difficulties:
