<PRE>Dear mentors,

I'm very interested for the JingleNodes and PseudoTCP projects in 
XMPP-Jitsi becaues both of project are very close to my current
research area -- TCP optimization for video delivery in wireless 
network. In the past few days, I read lots of
background documents about these two projects and here are some ideas I 
have now.

1, JingleNodes
Here are my reading list in the past week: XMPP core framework(RFC 
3920), Jingle(XEP-0176), ICE-UDP(XEP-0278),
Jingle ICE-UDP transport protocol(RFC 3920), STUN (RFC 5389) and TURN 
(RFC 5766).

Based on this, I have a deeper understanding about XMPP and Jingle 
structure. My understanding is that Jingle relay node
can be seen as the XMPP version of TURN/STUN relay server. Therefore, 
XMPP client can do the NAT traversal without STUN/TURN
support. In other words, Jingle relay node implement NAT traversal 
function within XMPP, but keep the media data transmission
out of XMPP which follows the design goal of Jingle.Also, because 
transport address gathering is down in Jingle relay node scheme,
can we say that Jingle ICE-UDP transport method  and Jingle relay node 
together implement a XMPP version of ICE UDP protocol?

Follow this logic, I have a rough idea for developing JingleNode:
   1), first, we need to develop Jingle ICE-TCP transport method 
extension for XMPP, just like the Jingle ICE-UDP transport method for UDP
        traffic in XMPP.  With this month, ICE-TCP became an IETF RFC( 
<A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6544">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6544</A> ). I'm not sure whether XMPP
       has the plan for combining this new transport method into its 
extensions.  If it doesn't, I think we need to do this first before
       developing Jingle relay node.

   2), second, we can extend the current JingleNode for UDP to TCP. I 
will check  details of this part from code in jinglerelay.org

I will very appreciated if you can give further comment on this rough idea.

2, PseudoTCP:  this is another project I'm interested to. Right now, I'm 
the documents on this part. The question here is whether I
     can apply two projects for one orgnization under GSoC or not? If 
not, I will select one project which I have most clear idea to apply.

Looking forward for your reply.

Best regards
Dizhi
