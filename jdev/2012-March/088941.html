Yep, in the end it's just an HTTP proxy. The fact that there's a
tunnel and XMPP is invisible to the WebDAV user.

&gt;<i> b)
</I>&gt;<i> What is your general opinion on this approach? Would the amount and

Depends on what you are actually trying to build. Do you need realtime
sync like Dropbox? Is WebDAV a requirement? Can Bob run a custom
client? Is the server having a copy of the files a good thing?

WebDAV isn't too great at realtime sync AFAIK. And if Bob can run a
custom client, an end-to-end Jingle session between Bob and Alice
would be much better than tunneling through Tom's server, since that
saves bandwidth for the server, allows direct peer to peer transfers,
etc. If the server would want to keep a copy of everything anyway
(like it does in Dropbox's case), then
&quot;upload-files-to-central-server-and-then-download-from-there&quot; would be
better.

&gt;<i> Anyways, thanks a ton for the confidence :)
