<PRE>Hi Jon / Hi everyone else,

even though you also sent me a personal mail, I guess it is a better 
idea to answer to the list. Maybe someone else wants to join in. I'm not 
dead, only very busy with a job completely unrelated to XMPP. :(

An XMPP-based media server was part of my PhD thesis. If you have a lot 
of free time: <A HREF="http://elib.suub.uni-bremen.de/diss/docs/00011878.pdf">http://elib.suub.uni-bremen.de/diss/docs/00011878.pdf</A>
If you don't, take a look at chapters 2.1, 6 and 7. They contain the use 
cases for my idea, the generic secure architecture and what you can do 
with it.

&gt;<i> I just wanted to let you know that we have produced a draft of the
</I>&gt;<i> features for the first version of Pontarius. You can read it
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.pontarius.org/pontarius-0-1-features-draft/.">http://www.pontarius.org/pontarius-0-1-features-draft/.</A> Also see the

Sounds good. A gvfs backend would be cool to get an easy integration. 
Besides not having time to work on XMPP I'm the maintainer of Freevo 
(<A HREF="http://www.freevo.org">http://www.freevo.org</A>) -- also no time lately, but if I do, I want to 
integrate the ideas into Freevo.

Right now, the lack of free time is the main reason why I don't continue 
the work. But I still plan to do so. If we can join forces (and maybe 
other people) this could help a lot. I don't have time to write XEPs or 
hack code, but I do have some minutes for discussions.


Regards,

Dirk
