It certainly does keep me busy... But it's an amazing read! Thanks again! :)

Good point!

I'm thinking - translating our current vision for Pontarius into XPMN 
terms - Pontarius 0.1 would consist of software for three XPMN 
/services/: photo, audio and video. We also want to try to make 
/controller//interface software for a set as devices such as web browser 
(implementing as many features as possible in a JavaScript application), 
some or all major operating systems and possibly also some smartphones 
like the Android phone (perhaps depending on what happens with 
Java/Linux and Oracle vs. Google).

Would this be redundant in some way? Would this be useful for you, XPMN 
and the Freevo project? Is there something else you would like to see us 
do or any other route you think we should take?

Thank you!

Warm regards,
Jon Kristensen
