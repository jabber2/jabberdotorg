If firewalls did this, TCP would *break* for all applications.  Can  
you please give a concrete example of a firewall that has this property?

You never know this, no matter how many pings you send of whatever  
type.  What we're trying to do is detect as soon as possible that the  
connection has been dropped, in the case of a hard machine crash on  
the other side or a network cable being pulled.
