<PRE>I just thought I should share my experiences with Google Talk and  
Multi-User Chat.

Multi-User Chat works (for the most part) with clients who use google  
talk. They can join conference rooms and send messages to and from  
them. One thing that is broken is invitations. People with google  
talk accounts just never get any invitation sent to them!

I believe this is because of google talk's &quot;accept no communication  
from anyone not on my roster or from anyone I haven't sent anything  
to&quot; policy. Once a presence stanza is sent to a room, I can send and  
receive stanzas just fine. However, invitations are sent from the  
conference-room JID itself which means that it will always get  
filtered by google talk.

This is a big problem. With no easy way to give someone the ability  
to quickly join a conference room, it becomes much more cumbersome  
and complicated when I try to get non-technical family members to  
join specific rooms. It doesn't help that most clients don't support  
the &quot;xmpp&quot; URI correctly (ARGH!!!).

One way to fix this would be for google to add a special exception to  
the filter rules that would examine to see if the stanza was a  
conference room invitation or not. If it is a conference room  
invitation, it should check inside of the stanza to make sure that  
the person who invited them is on that person's contact list. If they  
are, then it the invitation would be allowed to go through.

Make sense? Anyway, I just wanted to bring this shortcoming to the  
community's attention. Hopefully it'll be fixed at some point.
