<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; So the question is : Can still my software be called a [ WEB CONFERENCE
</I>software ] ?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Web is generally considered to be the serving of data across HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> (usually relating to HTML pages (although other media is included))
</I>&gt;<i> directed by UR(L|I)s, so I think you'd be hard-pressed to call a
</I>&gt;<i> local application not serving data across HTTP a web app :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
:<i>) Surely it's not a web app. And I agree that if the service provides WC
</I>features on  Web-based applications, sending data via HTTP, it's surely a
WEB CONFERENCE. I was just confused about this.

&gt;<i>From Wikipedia (<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing</A>).
</I>
In the later 1990's, Microsoft introduced a true web conferencing
&gt;<i> application, NetMeeting
</I>

NetMeeting seems not to use HTTP server and it's not a web-based app.
Besides, there're some Web conference services that still requires users to
download and install their client software in order to use the service. And
it doesn't seem that they use HTTP for their features. They're still called
Web conference software (WorkSpace3D of TixeoSoft and some others - I don't
remember exactly the names)

Any explanations?  :(
