</I>&gt;<i> There is one problem with this approach -- it requires the user to give
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> password to your server.  A better approach might be having your server
</I>&gt;<i> send
</I>&gt;<i> a one-use token to that user via XMPP, and having them enter that.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> can prove they own the JID without them having to sacrifice their
</I>&gt;<i> password.
</I>&gt;<i>

Trejkaz, can you explain more about that approach? I have found this article
which is about x google token. Is that what you mean??

Hmm, by the way can anybody explain me about the &quot;Web conference&quot; (WC)
concept?
I have looked it up on
Wikipedia&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing</A>&gt;but still have
some confusions about the word &quot;Web&quot;.
-  Does a WC software have to be a web-based application?
-  Does the WC software have to be based on HTTP?

I'm trying to develope my own WC software. There's so many WC software
providers nowadays. That would be great if users can login with his only JID
and still can communicate with other users at any XMPP servers while taking
part in the conference. That's what brings me to XMPP.

I'm developing a system that provides all the WC features (Slide
presentations, Application sharing, Text messaging, File sharing,
Whiteboard...). It's an application-based one and I just exchange data via
TCP/IP by sending my data packet (include flags and serialized data), no
standard protocol (except for XMPP in Authentication and sending messages).

The truth is, when i began developing this, i found there's really a problem
if I wrote it as a web-based app because of the limitations of Web controls
(especially for developing Application sharing and Whiteboard features).
That's why my software now is an application-based and isn't based on HTTP.

So the question is : Can still my software be called a Web conference
software?
