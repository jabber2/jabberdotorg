These are not available on the public internet though and do not
federate in the &#8220;normal&#8221; IM XMPP network, are they?

I think it's important that the standards which provide reasonable, or
even the best available, security for appliances put on the public
network and federating with the &#8220;normal&#8221; IM XMPP network are the
default. The reason is simple. Someone installing a service which can be
secure by the way it is set up or how the network works, without any
transport-layer encryption, will have the knowledge required to
reconfigure the server software and maybe even how to bulk-reconfigure
the client software.

As far as I take it, we're not talking about removing &#8220;insecure&#8221; options
altogether. Just make it hard for the average user to trigger them.
Thats the only way to get it secure for the average IM user, and that's
what the XMPP network should try to accomplish, I think.

But thats just, like, my opinion, man :)

Jonas
