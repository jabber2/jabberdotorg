</I>I find it interesting that according to Google trends, although &quot;xmpp
server&quot; and &quot;jabber server&quot; are roughly equal, &quot;jabber client&quot; is searched
for roughly twice as much as &quot;xmpp client&quot;.

So if we're purely aiming at end users wanting IM accounts, then yes,
Jabber seems to be the obvious choice. I think this document essentially
aims at server administrators (who apparently use either equally), but I
suspect that the whole TLS thing would be most useful if it were something
server admins could brag about to their users; that suggests using the
Jabber mark.


&gt;<i> And I really don't want to have this discussion forever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Nope. But as I said, I think this is going to create a name for a network
of servers providing a specific level of security. In that event, we should
probably check it's the most effective name.

I'm not terribly keen on having to tell users that they should register a
jabber id on the jabber registration server, which'll register them onto an
XMPP server on the XMPP network. Using one name throughout seems more
sensible.

But I can deal with that - I'm really just flagging that this is the time
to make that choice. Once this &quot;goes out&quot;, as it were, it'll be a bit late
to try and rebrand (again).

Dave.
