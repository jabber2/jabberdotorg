<PRE>Tijl,

I don't know where to get the actual DTD but here is the documentation I can
find on the message element.

&quot;A message chunk MAY contain zero or one of each of the following child
elements (which may not contain mixed content):
body - The textual contents of the message; normally included but not
required. The &lt;body/&gt; element MUST NOT have any attributes.&quot;

Stuffing xml into the body tag doesn't seem to violate this.   I do have to
escape the tags stuffed into the &lt;body&gt; element.

The reason I want to do this is simple though perhaps not sufficient to
justify abusing the tag in this way. My client has a lot of functionality
specific to managing data about items that are bought and sold. I would like
to be able to send that data to anyone with a Jabber client. Stuffing the
data in the body tag ensures that they can get the information whereas using
a separate namespace might cause the data to be missed.  Anyone who receives
such a message would be able to understand the contents and decide what to
do with it.

I may be stating heresy here but I think one of the greatest values of XML
is that it is that you can look at it and know what it means as opposed to,
say, looking at an EDI document..

Dan
