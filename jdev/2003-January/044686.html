<PRE>Sending XML Payloads with your messages is perfectly legal.  Just put it
under the root message node like so.

&lt;message to='' from='' type='mycustommessage|chat|whatever'&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;If you had my client you would be getting Bridge
information.&lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;subject&gt;bridge&lt;/subject&gt;
	&lt;mydata xmlns=&quot;my:custom:namespace&quot;&gt;
		&lt;bridgexml&gt;
			more data
		&lt;/bridgexml&gt;
	&lt;/mydata&gt;
&lt;/message&gt; 

If you implement your own namespaces you aren't constrained by the
jabber:x:x namespace specs (although jabber:x:oob is pretty open-ended).
Also, it is not allowed to use a &quot;jabber:mynamespace&quot; namespace that
isn't in the spec.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [JDEV] client to client communication using jabber?

Brief description of what we're trying to do:
- our project is a Bridge Bidding tool, it allows two players to
'practice' 
bidding hands over the Internet
- we decided to use the JabberCom object, and use it for our embedded
chat 
client (so they can discuss things from within the program)
- when I saw I could send XML strings using Jabber, I thought I'd use
that 
also for one client to talk to the other one (passing strings
representing 
each player's hand of cards, what bid they're making, and so on).

I'm having a little difficulty working out if it is even possible to
send 
my own (somewhat limited) dtd or basically arbitrary data from one 
client/jid to the other (I don't care if it has to go through the
server, I 
just want the server to forward it to the other client). Actual messages

are no problem, but the documentation doesn't clearly guide me as to how
to 
do that (much of it being in the form of proposals I guess so I'm trying
to 
do things that aren't implemented it seems).

I've seen things like jabber:x:data - which sounds like it would do, or 
jabber:something:oob. The protocol document was a good start, where do I
go 
from here?

The two clients can message successfully, so, it's a matter of working
out 
how to send xml from one to the other (assuming I can) that contains my 
application's data.

Any pointers or references that google isn't turning up for me that
anyone 
can think of?

Thanks,
