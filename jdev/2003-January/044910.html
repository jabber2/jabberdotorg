<PRE>What is wrong with Y!?  I haven't bothered installing the Y!-t on my 
server because:
a) I don't know anyone who uses Y!
b) No one who uses my server has told me (and I have asked quite a few) 
that they know anyone who uses Y!
An IM network only survives because people can use it to talk to their 
friends.  Since Y! has sucha a small user base, the only way they can 
compete is by interoperability.  This makes no sense.  Still, I suppose 
if they had sense, they'd be using Jabber :)
