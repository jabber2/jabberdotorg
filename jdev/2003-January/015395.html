<PRE>Brief description of what we're trying to do:
- our project is a Bridge Bidding tool, it allows two players to 'practice' 
bidding hands over the Internet
- we decided to use the JabberCom object, and use it for our embedded chat 
client (so they can discuss things from within the program)
- when I saw I could send XML strings using Jabber, I thought I'd use that 
also for one client to talk to the other one (passing strings representing 
each player's hand of cards, what bid they're making, and so on).

I'm having a little difficulty working out if it is even possible to send 
my own (somewhat limited) dtd or basically arbitrary data from one 
client/jid to the other (I don't care if it has to go through the server, I 
just want the server to forward it to the other client). Actual messages 
are no problem, but the documentation doesn't clearly guide me as to how to 
do that (much of it being in the form of proposals I guess so I'm trying to 
do things that aren't implemented it seems).

I've seen things like jabber:x:data - which sounds like it would do, or 
jabber:something:oob. The protocol document was a good start, where do I go 
from here?

The two clients can message successfully, so, it's a matter of working out 
how to send xml from one to the other (assuming I can) that contains my 
application's data.

Any pointers or references that google isn't turning up for me that anyone 
can think of?

Thanks,


</PRE>
