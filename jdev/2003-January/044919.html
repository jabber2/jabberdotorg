<PRE>The main problem I see for this, is that this would only work for people 
with static IPs.  A jabber address is <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">username at server</A>'s_DNS_entry.  If 
you're on a dial-up, you won't have a static DNS entry, so people will 
have to add you to their roster every time you log on.  Secondly, if the 
server is only running when the client is running, then when the client 
is offline, messages sent to the user will bounce.
I suppose that there's no reason why you couldn't register a jabber 
account with a remote server, and run the transports on a local server, 
except that you'd probably have to re-register with the trasnports every 
time you ran the client (You can't use @localhost in a remote roster, 
since localhost wouldn't be your machine, but the server), although this 
could be automated.

</I>&gt;<i>     I had a thought: a jabber server + jabber client packaged into a
</I>&gt;<i>     single installer could be used as a convinient multiprotocol IM
</I>&gt;<i>     client. I.e., both the j server &amp; j client will run on the same
</I>&gt;<i>     localhost. They may even be compiled into a single executable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>     Rationales
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Rationale 1.  I find it difficult to find a working gateway server
</I>&gt;<i>     e.g. for icq, aim, msn, yahoo. So the main point is that the local
</I>&gt;<i>     gateways to these services will work much better, since the
</I>&gt;<i>     localhost does have a very little load.  Here, i mostly speak
</I>&gt;<i>     about free gateway servers for icq, aim, yahoo. They are sometimes
</I>&gt;<i>     unstable, overloaded, slow, etc. The local system might represent
</I>&gt;<i>     a more attractive choice.  Additionally, the local server will not
</I>&gt;<i>     become banned by AOL and other companies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Rationale 2.  The system will be much less distributed, and,
</I>&gt;<i>     therefore, much more stable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>     Possible implementation details
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The local jabber server does not have to use jabber s2s, it may
</I>&gt;<i>     have a special transport for c2s to public jabber servers &amp;
</I>&gt;<i>     services.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Any local jabber server configuration tasks that are too advanced
</I>&gt;<i>     and/or not useful in the normal circumstances can be done at
</I>&gt;<i>     compile time and/or automatically at runtime, such that the
</I>&gt;<i>     enduser will never be able to get to these handles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>     Questions
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>     Question 1.  Is there anyone who develops such a project?
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>     Question 2.  Does this sound as an interesting idea for anyone to
</I>&gt;<i>     pick up?
