The Mach kernel, which came out of SMU, is a small computer version of the
BSD kernel. 
So it may not be FreeBSD, but it essentially BSD ( as opposed to other
flavours of Unix).

I'm afraid you're a little confused. Mach was a microkernel research
project which did, in various ways, incorporate large parts of the BSD
kernel to provide Unix functionality. However, it was most definitely not
Unix at its core. That was just a &quot;personality&quot; layered on top. Mach has
also supported personalities based upon Linux, OSF/1, NextStep (basically
BSD 4.2), the Hurd (which is quite different from Unix), and no doubt quite
a few research operating systems of which I've never heard.

How does saying Apple have moved to FreeBSD when they haven't classify as
humour????

RE: RE: [JDEV] yahoo issues anyone?Actually the Mach kernel came out of a
research project at CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) not SMU, and as has
already been said is not just for BSD but is used in a lot of other systems,
but yes coming back to the main point Darwin is based on BSD/Mach just as
FreeBSD is based on BSD but that still does not mean MacOSX is FreeBSD, its
not.

Anyway I think thats enough of this argument ;), if anyone still wants to
argue about this I suggest we take it off list or that you do some googling.

Mach project website for anyone interested:
