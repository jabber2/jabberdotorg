<PRE>You can run a Jabber server with a dynamic IP.  I'm doing it now.  I use a
dynamic domain (free) from no-ip.com.  They have a utility that refreshes
the IP.  Works fine except for the occasional delay when a DNS update is
being rolled out.

</I>&gt;<i> with multiple other clients simultaneously as a result of a search.
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, that's over engineering an established solution in my books,
