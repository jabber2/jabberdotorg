It will send default presence to anyone on your roster, unless invisibility
or the blacklisting stuff is being used AFAIK.

&gt;<i> Why do you think it shouldn't be that way? Can't see the benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> sending default presence to these users.
</I>
Because you would have to log in and out if you wanted to start them
receiving default presence, also what is the point in having different
presences for different people other than showing as invisible, I cant see
the benefit of that and it greatly complicates things, the only real use so
far is invisibility which has already been sorted so I say just leave things
as is since there is no problem.

&gt;<i> But for the original problem it would be a solution then to login to the
</I>&gt;<i> server with a presence of type invisible (transports would stay offline
</I>&gt;<i> then) and sending individual presences to every item on the users roster.
</I>
Yes the best solution is to use the invisibility extensions, send out
invisibility to the transports and then send the normal presence i think
that should work ok, invisiblity is what should be used if you want people
or transports to think you are offline, the only problem comes now that
transports probably wont be explicitly programmed to support the relatively
new invisiblity and will need to be tested to see what they do when
invisibility is used.
