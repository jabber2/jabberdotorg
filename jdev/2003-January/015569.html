Don't worry Peter, I'm aware that Exodus is not the same as WinJab.

I've been through the source a few months back, I might not agree with 
all design decision, but it is a good client. On Windows... 

Though it's less dependand on win32-only things then the old Winjab (If 
I'm not mistaken it's library was a COM object). It still uses a mix of 
VCL and tntUnicode controls, wich doesn't port well to Kylix/Linux I'd 
say! So at best you can use parts of the library, rewriting the GUI 
will be a very considerable effort. 

At best, the library is a good basis for a linux/kylix jabber library, 
but that's far from a &quot;strong foundation for a modern Linux client&quot;.

I suppose WINE would be an option.. but since it's Delphi you can't 
*compile* it with WINE either. But I would not call a client running 
under/with WINE a &quot;strong foundation for a modern Linux Client&quot; either. 

I still think it's strange to name only non-linux clients when there 
are (superiour IMHO) linux clients available.
