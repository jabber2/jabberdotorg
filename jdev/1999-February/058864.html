&gt;<i> 	Well, I guess my next question would be is if we have any sort of tentative
</I>&gt;<i> date for a working server that will use this protocol?  My suggestion would
</I>&gt;<i> be to get the transport using it for the client connections first, so anyone
</I>&gt;<i> workingon clients can get their act together the fastest..
</I>
It's always been &quot;tomorrow&quot; but I've barely had a chance to sit down and
catch up on email(obviously) in the last month... things seem to be
slowing down a bit though, so hopefully we'll see something this weekend!

&gt;<i> 	Also, I know there was mention of a CVS archive..  How often is it updated
</I>&gt;<i> on the server side? Looking at the snaps on jabber.org, it appears to only
</I>&gt;<i> be updated every so often.  Also I'd be interested in checking things in
</I>&gt;<i> once I have these C++ classes ironed out.  I'm attempting to remove all
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies on MFC so that they would be much more cross platform.  (IF
</I>&gt;<i> anyone has plugin replacements for CString and CAsyncSocket, Email me, we'll
</I>&gt;<i> do lunch!! ;-P)
</I>
It's updated nightly, but there hasn't been all that much activity over
the last month.  After I get some of the new XML stuff done and checked
in, things will start picking up dramatically.
