#### Intro

The Jabber Transport is the heart of the whole system.  It is what all
Jabber clients connect to, and what most data will pass through at some
point. 

It starts and operates just like any other Transport would, but it also
starts listening on a network socket port 5222 for connections from
clients.  The protocol used when talking to the clients is a superset of
the main Jabber protocol, containing many little two way special exchanges
just between the clients and this server. 

Most of the client-server architecture here is based around a
smart-server, where all of the intelligence and decision making is going
on in the server.  All data and configuration information is stored on the
server.  This allows for roaming users, simple clients, and a user being
able to use any client and have it be configured the way they want it with
all of their information available as soon as they log in. 

The incoming data is processed into simple C structures, then passed to
the modules through the API.  The modules handle almost all of the
important functions and decision making for each user, allowing new
modules to be written to add significant new functionality without
affecting the rest of the server. 


#### Modules

The current proposal for configuring modules and associating users to
modules is to use a &quot;group&quot; idea, so that each user belonged in a group. 
Then each group could be configured to just use bits and pieces of certain
modules, or all of one module.  All of the auth handlers would return a
group ID when they authorize a user to tell the server what group to place
that user in. 

Example, start with the following modules:

mod_mysql: provides all handlers based on DB tables
mod_unix: provides auth and info/search only via /etc/passwd
mod_roster: file based fast hashed roster management
mod_archive: stores all messages for web based searchable archive

And have the main config file like:
&lt;users&gt;
	&lt;!--mod_unix's auth handler returns this group--&gt;
	&lt;locals&gt;
		&lt;offline&gt;archive&lt;/offline&gt;
		&lt;roster&gt;roster&lt;/roster&gt;
		&lt;message&gt;archive&lt;/message&gt;
	&lt;/locals&gt;
	&lt;!--mod_mysql's auth handler returns this group, defaults all of it's users to itself--&gt;
	&lt;general default='mysql'/&gt;
 	&lt;special&gt;
		&lt;offline&gt;mysql&lt;/offline&gt;
		&lt;roster&gt;roster&lt;/roster&gt;
		&lt;message&gt;archive&lt;/message&gt;
		&lt;status&gt;mysql&lt;/status&gt;
	&lt;/special&gt;
&lt;/users&gt;

Obviously, this is a really simplified example, but hopefully enough to
convey the idea.  All the modules are asked to authenticate a user, and
when they do they return one of the group names from above(locals,
general, special) which the server uses to figure out what module's
handlers to call for that user for each of the handlers.

The current module API, straight from the C file:
typedef struct
{
        int module;
        void (*init)(jpair *);
        int (*authenticate)(char *, char *);
		## Authentication handler
        int (*notify)(char *, int);
		## Tells the module when other users go online/offline
        jpair *(*status)(char *, int);
		## Notifies the module of its user's status
        jpair *(*roster)(int, char *, char *, char *);
		## Requested changes to the roster for the user
        jpair *(*offline_message)(char *, jpair *);
		## Store an offline message for the user
        jpair *(*online_message)(char *);
		## The users back, are there any stored messages?
        jpair *(*search)(char *);
		## Return any information for the user(incomplete!)
        void (*log)(char *);
		## Simple raw data logging
} module;

I need to take some time and rethink this API, it's definitely not
complete yet.  I also need to figure out if there is a better way of
making modules.  The way I'm doing it is sudo Apache-style, creating a
global array and identifying each module by a compiled in int.  Anyone
familiar with C and allowing 3rd party modules, please feel free to jump
in here :) 


#### Privacy

Right now the server is using a simple 4-level privacy indicator, which is
identified by the module that authenticated the user. 
	#define SEC_INVISIBLE 1
		Nobody can ever even know this user exists unless the receive a message for them.  
		Status doesn't work at all, nobody can see this user's status.
	#define SEC_LIST 2
		No information is available(name/address/etc) except for username.
		Status only works for those that are on this users roster.
	#define SEC_SAFE 3
		Everything works normally, name/address is available for searching/info requests.
		Everyone can see current online status.
	#define SEC_NONE 4
		Same as 3, but anything that can be automated is, such as when a user adds this user
		to their roster and sends an invitation, the server will automatically add them to this
		users roster.
I don't like how this works, and if possible I would like to get rid of it
completely and move all of these decisions into the module API. 



#### Code

MUCH work needs to be done here.  After expat replaces tsp in the common
lib, a complete cleanup of the Jabber Transport needs to happen.  The
module API mentioned above needs to be solidified and the new group idea
needs to be written.

There's not really all that much that the transport does, just parsing out
the protocol into structures, calling the module API where appropriate,
maintaining a list of connected users and their current status, and
dealing with errors/conflicts.  I'd like to make the code as straight
forward as this sounds :)
