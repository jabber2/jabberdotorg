There are a couple of problems with using the CVS pserver. Anyone who has
write access can do almost anything on the system. But assuming you let
trusted developers, you shouldn't have a problem. The CVS passwords are
encoded using a very simple scheme. However, also assuming that your CVS
passwords are different from users on the box, you shouldn't have a
problem.

If you need any help setting this up, feel free to contact me.

&gt;<i> #### Code
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are lots of issues that need to be addressed here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	==&gt; Makefile/Configuration
</I>&gt;<i> 		-&gt; Use the standard configure

</I>

I think this is the best way. We want to make this easy to use, flexible,
and compatible. Autoconf/Automake are two of the best utilities to ensure
this. I have some experience in this area, as I'm sure others do as well.

&gt;<i> 	==&gt; Platform Specific Code
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 		[There's none right now, that's right, not a drop.  I'd love to
</I>&gt;<i> keep it this way, but I'm thinking that there will be certain things that
</I>&gt;<i> should be tweaked on certain platforms.  Simple ifdef's and a make-passed
</I>&gt;<i> uname -s definition for OS should suffice, no?]
</I>
This is one place using the traditional Autoconf/Automake combination can
really make a difference.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	==&gt; Code Style
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 		[I'm open to suggestions, and now that I have a fast *nix platform
</I>&gt;<i> here at home I can start happily learning emacs(again) and fix the
</I>&gt;<i> indentation.  Right now it's a simple whitespace-happy style, all {}'s on
</I>&gt;<i> their own lines and spaces around all operators and after all commas]
</I>
I'm not a fan of the old K&amp;R style, but love the whitespace friendly
environment.. However, C is C, so whatever works best.. 


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	==&gt; Expat
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 		[All XML needs to start passing through expat.  I started looking
</I>&gt;<i> at it, and am definitely going to need some help making it work, not sure
</I>&gt;<i> I totally understand it yet but it's integration will happen]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	==&gt; String functions
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 		[I want to clean up all string use.  Add to the common lib a
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper around all OS string operations and make all string calls safe to
</I>&gt;<i> pass NULL's and empty strings to, and make sure it's known when new memory
</I>&gt;<i> is being allocated/returned]
</I>&gt;<i>
