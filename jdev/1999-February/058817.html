<PRE>&gt;<i> I dont see any reason for any CLI daemon, if the CLI clients works like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  jwrite:        
</I>&gt;<i>       Compose/send simple messages, either typed or from STDIN
</I>&gt;<i>       [Connect to server;authenticate;send message;disconnect]
</I>
It should work this way when it can't find a background daemon...

&gt;<i>              
</I>&gt;<i>  jmesg:
</I>&gt;<i>       Change/check current status, online, offline, away,
</I>&gt;<i>       [Connect to server;authenticate;get/set status;disconnect]
</I>
Woops, nope, won't work.  The server will only hold your status as long as
there is an open TCP connection, disconnecting will drop everything.

&gt;<i>  jwho:             
</I>&gt;<i>       View roster and status of users on your roster. Add/remove entries.
</I>&gt;<i>       [Connect to server;authenticate;get/set roster;disconnect]
</I>
This can work this way also, BUT there are some drawbacks...

&gt;<i>  jtalk:            
</I>&gt;<i>       Start a threaded chat-like message communication with a user.
</I>&gt;<i>       (This is IMO not a command-line interface job. This can by it's
</I>&gt;<i>        very nature not be done as a one-shot deal. Start the real
</I>&gt;<i>        curses/gui-based client instead)
</I>
Well, I'm expecting that it would work just like normal &quot;talk&quot;

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This solution requires that you can set your status to &quot;semi-online&quot;, in
</I>&gt;<i> which case the jabber server should buffer messages.
</I>
This by it's very nature isn't how Jabber works... you can only be
&quot;online&quot; when you have an open TCP connection.  Having the server show you
as &quot;online&quot; when you are not really connected introduces some complexity
and problems that I don't really want to deal with for V1.0.

&gt;<i> I think a daemon on the client side is basically a bad idea, and can be
</I>&gt;<i> avoided. Correct me, if I'm wrong.
</I>
It can only be avoided if the server will keep you online when you are not
really connected...  Right now, IMHO the background daemon isn't that big
of a deal when compared to what you would have to do on the server side to
support this... the background daemon can act like a fairly simple &quot;proxy&quot;
providing this added functionality for those that need it.

The other thing is, I REALLY want to be notified immediately in my shell
when a message arrives, just like the standard &quot;write&quot; or &quot;talk&quot;, and the
ONLY way this can happen is via a background daemon.  So even though some
might not want this, the functionaly will need to be there anyway :)
