<PRE>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This brings up a sticky point perhaps someone could help me understand.  I
</I>&gt;<i> was working with an artist on an interface for a Jabber client.  In my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion it looks very cool, and operates very effectively.  However, it
</I>&gt;<i> makes use of a lot of original art created by the artist.  Artists are
</I>&gt;<i> an order of magnitude more concerned about IP issues than comptuer
</I>&gt;<i> scientists.  I've looked through the GPL and I'm not sure it would apply
</I>&gt;<i> well to the art.  Either the art would fall under the category of
</I>&gt;<i> something that stands alone, in which case it would not be GPL when
</I>&gt;<i> seperated from the code, or perhaps not.  In any case, if a client library
</I>&gt;<i> was LGPL, I could use it while keeping other parts of the program, such as
</I>&gt;<i> the artwork, &quot;proprietary&quot;.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I can't come up with a decent solution, my other options are just using
</I>&gt;<i> a traditional interface (Will we be stuck with last decades GUI concepts
</I>&gt;<i> forever?!) because the artist won't risk losing his reputation by letting
</I>&gt;<i> go of control of his art, or to write a completely proprietary client,
</I>&gt;<i> which would be boring and useless, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts?
</I>
First, I'm very intersted to see a cool interface, it could be the &quot;killer
app&quot; for Jabber :)

IANAL(I Am Not A Lawyer) but I really don't think the GPL specifically
covers anything but source code, and if the &quot;art&quot; is just some
graphics/skins for the app, it wouldn't be covered.  If the art was turned
into a big hex array and included in the source, it might be covered, but
otherwise I would think you're safe... but that's just IMHO.
