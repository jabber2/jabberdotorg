<PRE>Hello,


I like Jabber very much, but file transfer has always been a problem. I 
don't have much time (now) to do research on this, but I've tried a JAJC 
&lt;-&gt; Trillian Pro, a Psi &lt;-&gt; Exodus and a Psi &lt;-&gt; Trillian Pro file 
transfer. Others tried a Trillian Pro &lt;-&gt; Trillian Pro. All of them 
didn't work.

It could be that they would work through some settings, but my opinion 
is that it should work out of the box (like MSN &lt;-&gt; MSN works out of the 
box).

I've read (more like a &quot;quick look&quot; due to lack of time) the Psi-forums 
and what I've read on [1] was &quot;This is a deficiency in the Jabber 
protocol, what can I say? I tried to argue for this extension almost two 
years ago, but it didn't work out.&quot;

Do others also have file transfer problems? Do others agree there is a 
deficiency in the protocol? All I can say is that file transfer should 
be made easy, working out of the box...

FYI: all the file transfer tests were on a network where every computer 
is on the same intranet (172.16.64.*), but to connect to the *I*nternet, 
we need a vpn-connection (157.193.*). In linux this corresponds to eth0 
and ppp0.

I'm sorry I didn't tried to do more tests, but I really don't have the 
time now. But I think easy file transfer is a key-thing for a 
breakthrough of Jabber. If there wouldn't be any reactions, I pick up on 
this later, when I have more time to do some in-depth file transfer tests.


Greetings,
Mattias Campe
