<PRE>Yes, there is definitely a problem, but I don't I agree with your solution.

Clients are &quot;behind&quot; because nearly all of them are hobby projects.  I think I 
can speak for most of us in saying that we are working as fast as we can 
within our available time, and throwing a certification weight on our 
shoulders wouldn't speed anything up.

In addition, many of the features you mention just plain aren't ready in 
specification form.  Avatars?  XHTML-IM?  Voice chat?  These are all 
Experimental.  Maybe we should start certifying Jabber Council members, to 
motivate them to approve some JEPs?  (and speaking of which, my &quot;jep-secure&quot; 
has beat the record of the longest time from submission to publication, and 
is still counting.)

Regarding the jabber.org client list:  Yes, it is a zoo, but I think we 
decided awhile ago that jabber.org should always contain a complete listing, 
and if we wanted a smaller list (ie, just the &quot;user oriented&quot; software) then 
that listing, along with reviews, etc, would take place on an end-user site, 
such as &quot;jabbercentral&quot; (whenever it gets back...) or the theoretical 
&quot;jabber.net&quot;.

That said, certification is a neat idea.  I'm not necessarily against it.  It 
would allow some of us to have &quot;bragging rights&quot;.  I just don't think it will 
have the impact that you're shooting for.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The thing is, there are all these very cool Jabber featuresets out

</I>&gt;<i> peer pressure) is there much incentive for people to implement certain
</I>&gt;<i> things.  I can look at Jabber and go 'wow, pubsub is a cool backend
</I>&gt;<i> system, Stream Initiation will let me do a lot of really cool things
</I>&gt;<i> down the line' and be excited, but your average IM user (for instance,
</I>&gt;<i> my mother or father) will look at Jabber and go 'why can't I set a nice
</I>&gt;<i> little picture like under MSN?  And why can't I use bold in my
</I>&gt;<i> messages?' and so on.  Jabber is, architecturally, probably the most
</I>&gt;<i> advanced IM protocol out there, and it's a godsend to developers... but
</I>&gt;<i> to end-users, it doesn't really replace the AIM featureset or whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> XHTML-IM has been a JEP for a rather long time, and few clients
</I>&gt;<i> implement it (and moreover, some of them implement it in a nonstandard
</I>&gt;<i> and wacky way!), and it's a fairly basic feature many IM end users look
</I>&gt;<i> for.  And there's no real incentive (other than peer pressure, as I
</I>&gt;<i> said) for a client author to implement XHTML, so it ends up getting
</I>&gt;<i> pushed further and further down TODO lists and suchnot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So there was discussion in the chatroom today about a compliance and
</I>&gt;<i> certification program, with varying levels of certification and
</I>&gt;<i> differing requirements for the levels.  Only certified clients would be
</I>&gt;<i> on jabber.org's client list, certified clients would get the right to
</I>&gt;<i> use a little 'certified' banner on their websites and in their
</I>&gt;<i> documentation or whatever, and it would ensure featuresets /do/ get
</I>&gt;<i> implemented for end-users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am writing up a quick proposal about how to do this.  If enough folks
</I>&gt;<i> like it (and there's not too much ensuing flamethrower usage in my
</I>&gt;<i> direction), I will write it up in JEP format and submit it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** PROPOSED JABBER CERTIFICATION PROGRAM **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each certification would have a year attached to it.  For instance,
</I>&gt;<i> 'Jabber Basic Certified 2004' for a banner on a site.  A certification
</I>&gt;<i> only lasts until the end of a calendar year, and then you have to
</I>&gt;<i> re-apply for certification; having a certification for a given year is
</I>&gt;<i> not a guarantee you will have it next year.  Certifications can have
</I>&gt;<i> required features, and recommended features (i.e. 'MUST' and 'SHOULD').
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The certification requirements for a calendar year would be set by a
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber Certification Board, presumably appointed by the Council.  The
</I>&gt;<i> requirements for a given year would be decided on in July of the
</I>&gt;<i> previous year, giving individuals six months to implement the features
</I>&gt;<i> (and apply for certification ahead of time).  For instance, if this
</I>&gt;<i> program were in effect, next month the Certification Board would have
</I>&gt;<i> to issue the certification requirements for 2005, giving all the
</I>&gt;<i> developers time to implement the features and apply for certification
</I>&gt;<i> before the end of 2004 (and thus the expiration of their existing
</I>&gt;<i> certification).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be certified, you would need to get a copy of the software in
</I>&gt;<i> question to the Board to use, and they'd run it against some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> validation suite.  Presumably they'd have a process for testing, either
</I>&gt;<i> certain automated things they could point to or a script for
</I>&gt;<i> hand-testing it all.  You could apply for more than one certification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A couple examples of certification types are shown below.  These are
</I>&gt;<i> NOT actual proposals, just examples of what a certification list might
</I>&gt;<i> be.  You'd actually want much longer and more detailed certification
</I>&gt;<i> criteria, of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber Client Minimal
</I>&gt;<i>    - suitable for mobile or embedded clients
</I>&gt;<i>    - required   : roster management
</I>&gt;<i>    - required   : jid-to-jid chatting
</I>&gt;<i>    - recommended: groupchat-1.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber Client Intermediate
</I>&gt;<i>    - Suitable as a 'generic' client
</I>&gt;<i>    - required   : all of Jabber Client Minimal
</I>&gt;<i>    - required   : file transfer
</I>&gt;<i>    - required   : disco
</I>&gt;<i>    - required   : caps
</I>&gt;<i>    - recommended: XHTML-IM
</I>&gt;<i>    - recommended: avatars
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber Client Extended
</I>&gt;<i>    - Glitzier clients
</I>&gt;<i>    - required   : all of Jabber Client Intermediate
</I>&gt;<i>    - required   : xdata
</I>&gt;<i>    - required   : MU-C
</I>&gt;<i>    - recommended: pubsub
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...and so on.  There would be certifications for servers, and you could
</I>&gt;<i> even add usability guidelines as recommended things to the Client
</I>&gt;<i> specifications, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
