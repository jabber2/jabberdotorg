Well you know, if you're talking about an isolated server, then all the 
authorisation is in your hands and you can add users to others' lists without 
either party's permission (using SQL, if you have to!)  Also, there's nothing 
to particularly stop you implementing different semantics for a roster, 
including hacking the server to maintain a single roster for all users.

But I'm not sure if anyone's already doing this in the manner you suggest.  I 
think people just use the auto-population feature of jabberd2 for the new 
users to the company, and then make sure that people who leave remove 
themselves from everyone's list (or, write an SQL query to remove them from 
the database, which has been discussed on the list in the past.)
