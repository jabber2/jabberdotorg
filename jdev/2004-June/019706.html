Not sure yet -- I'm still mulling it over.

That's open for discussion. For one thing, it might help avoid the sort of
unfortunate occurrences we have seen in the past with regard to code theft.

Sure. I did not mean to imply that only JOSL 1.1 could be used, only 
that we'd need version 1.1 rather than 1.0 (which is unusable for this
purpose).
