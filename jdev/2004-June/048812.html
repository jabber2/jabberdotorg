<PRE>Tor 0.0.7.: an anonymizing overlay network for TCP-p2p 

<A HREF="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jun-2004/msg00002.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jun-2004/msg00002.html</A>


Tor 0.0.7.: an anonymizing overlay network for TCP-p2p an alternative to six/four-network.

Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system which addresses many flaws in the original onion
routing design. 


<A HREF="http://freehaven.net/tor/">http://freehaven.net/tor/</A>


The simple version: Tor provides a distributed network of servers (&quot;onion routers&quot;). Users bounce their TCP streams (web traffic,
FTP, SSH, etc.) around the routers. This makes it hard for recipients, observers, and even the onion routers themselves to track the
source of the stream.

The complex version: Onion Routing is a connection-oriented anonymizing communication service. Users choose a source-routed
path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a &quot;virtual circuit&quot; through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor and
successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the
downstream node.

 Why should I use Tor?


Individuals need Tor for privacy: 

     Privacy in web browsing -- both from the remote website (so it can't track and sell your behavior), and similarly from your local ISP. 
     Safety in web browsing: if your local government doesn't approve of its citizens visiting certain websites, they may monitor the sites and put readers on a list of
     suspicious persons. 
     Circumvention of local censorship: connect to resources (news sites, instant messaging, etc) that are restricted from your ISP/school/company/government. 
     Socially sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse survivors, or people with illnesses. 

Journalists and NGOs need Tor for safety: 

     Allowing dissidents and whistleblowers to communicate more safely. 
     Censorship-resistant publication and reading, e.g. of news sites not permitted in some countries. 
     Allowing their agents to check back with their home website while they're in a foreign country, without notifying everybody nearby that they're working with
     that organization. 

Companies need Tor for business security: 

     Competitive analysis: browse the competition's website safely. 
     Protecting collaborations of sensitive business units or partners. 
     Protecting procurement suppliers or patterns. 
     Putting the &quot;P&quot; back in &quot;VPN&quot;: traditional VPNs reveal the exact amount and frequency of communication. Which locations have employees working late?
     Which locations have employees consulting job-hunting websites? Which research groups are communicating with your company's patent lawyers? 

Governments need Tor for traffic-analysis-resistant communication: 

     Open source intelligence gathering (hiding individual analysts is not enough -- the organization itself may be sensitive). 
     Defense in depth on open and classified networks -- networks with a million users (even if they're all cleared) can't be made safe just by hardening them to
     external threat. 
     Dynamic and semi-trusted international coalitions: the network can be shared without revealing the existence or amount of communication between all parties. 
     Networks partially under known hostile control: to block communications, the enemy must take down the whole network. 
     Politically sensitive negotations. 
     Road warriors. 
     Protecting procurement patterns. 
     Anonymous tips. 

Law enforcement needs Tor for safety: 

     Allowing anonymous tips or crime reporting 
     Allowing agents to observe websites without notifying them that they're being observed (or, more broadly, without having it be an official visit from law
     enforcement). 
     Surveillance and honeypots (sting operations) 

Does the idea of sharing the Tor network with all of these groups bother you? It shouldn't -- you need them for your security.



Changes so far in 0.0.7: - 4. June 2004

  o Fixes for crashes and other obnoxious bugs:
    - Fix an epipe bug: sometimes when directory connections failed
      to connect, we would give them a chance to flush before closing
      them.
    - When we detached from a circuit because of resolvefailed, we
      would immediately try the same circuit twice more, and then
      give up on the resolve thinking we'd tried three different
      exit nodes.
    - Limit the number of intro circuits we'll attempt to build for a
      hidden service per 15-minute period.
    - Check recommended-software string *early*, before actually parsing
      the directory. Thus we can detect an obsolete version and exit,
      even if the new directory format doesn't parse.
  o Fixes for security bugs:
    - Remember which nodes are dirservers when you startup, and if a
      random OR enables his dirport, don't automatically assume he's
      a trusted dirserver.
  o Other bugfixes:
    - Directory connections were asking the wrong poll socket to
      start writing, and not asking themselves to start writing.
    - When we detached from a circuit because we sent a begin but
      didn't get a connected, we would use it again the first time;
      but after that we would correctly switch to a different one.
    - Stop warning when the first onion decrypt attempt fails; they
      will sometimes legitimately fail now that we rotate keys.
    - Override unaligned-access-ok check when $host_cpu is ia64 or
      arm. Apparently they allow it but the kernel whines.
    - Dirservers try to reconnect periodically too, in case connections
      have failed.
    - Fix some memory leaks in directory servers.
    - Allow backslash in Win32 filenames.
    - Made Tor build complain-free on FreeBSD, hopefully without
      breaking other BSD builds. We'll see.
    - Check directory signatures based on name of signer, not on whom
      we got the directory from. This will let us cache directories more
      easily.
  o Features:
    - Doxygen markup on all functions and global variables.
    - Make directory functions update routerlist, not replace it. So
      now directory disagreements are not so critical a problem.
    - Remove the upper limit on number of descriptors in a dirserver's
      directory (not that we were anywhere close).
    - Allow multiple logfiles at different severity ranges.
    - Allow *BindAddress to specify &quot;:port&quot; rather than setting *Port
      separately. Allow multiple instances of each BindAddress config
      option, so you can bind to multiple interfaces if you want.
    - Allow multiple exit policy lines, which are processed in order.
      Now we don't need that huge line with all the commas in it.
    - Enable accept/reject policies on SOCKS connections, so you can bind
      to 0.0.0.0 but still control who can use your OP.

<A HREF="http://freehaven.net/tor/">http://freehaven.net/tor/</A>

tor is a _fully_ anonymous transparent tunneling network for TCP
with onion routing, and at connection layer OpenSSL, just like
six/four-p2p, but with N onions instead of 2 now with the version 0.0.7 !. You fire it up and use it as a SOCKS
proxy (configuration and updates are internal) and that's it.

And it has a better routing strategy than six/four, a message
always reaches its destination, it's anonymous-remailer like which
means the only tradeoff is that all OR-servers (they are like
trusted peers and you need to get your cert signed just like in
six/four to run one) must be tcp-linked together, not a big one...

The coolest thing are &quot;location hidden services&quot; which means free
publishing. You &quot;publish&quot; a local directory on your HD and mark it
as location hidden services and run a normal (non-trusted) server.
With a freenet-like type of advertising protocol, others can
access it from anywhere else, if they know the URL. So you can also
publish in tor without anyone knowing where or who it's coming from...
