<PRE>Ms. Blackman is not advocating certification for its own sake.  The 
piece that I think was left unsaid was that there's all these cool specs 
for features, and users have a real desire to have those features, yet 
client haven't implemented them.

As a case in point, I refer to a fairly-recent thread in this very list 
on a &quot;deficiency of the protocol&quot;[1] for file transer.  The findings: 
not every client tested implemented file transfer according to spec. 
Yet the file transfer specs have been available for nearly a year.

How could certification help?  If we had certification, it would be a 
certainty that a list of certified clients would be available.  A user 
could obtain the list of clients &quot;certified for file transfer&quot;, and know 
that their chances of success are vastly greater than if they just 
started downloading clients.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ofcourse that sounds fair enough!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me quote you on what started this thread:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The thing is, there are all these very cool Jabber featuresets out  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there, but lots of them are not necessarily supported.  Nor (other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than  peer pressure) is there much incentive for people to implement 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certain  things.  I can look at Jabber and go 'wow, pubsub is a cool 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backend  system, Stream Initiation will let me do a lot of really cool 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things  down the line' and be excited, but your average IM user (for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance,  my mother or father) will look at Jabber and go 'why can't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I set a nice  little picture like under MSN?  And why can't I use bold 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in my  messages?' and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To me *that* sounds like you're saying: there are all kinds of cool  
</I>&gt;<i> specifications out there, but noone is using them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My question is: how do you think certification will help with that?
</I>&gt;<i> We all know some of those specs you mention will one day be a final  
</I>&gt;<i> standard, but some others will probably go from experimental to 
</I>&gt;<i> dereffered  and some will change heavily before becoming draft and 
</I>&gt;<i> final. Do you  predict that client authors will wait till there the 
</I>&gt;<i> certification  guidelines are known, and then implement these JEPs? Or 
</I>&gt;<i> do you think they  will start implementing JEPs in the hope they will be 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the  certification? Or another possibility I am missing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However *this* has a different sound to it;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you don't want to make changes to your client, that's fine.  You  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't suffer anything, you just don't get a new little badge with a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new  year on it, and you don't get in the next year's list of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certified  clients.  Meanwhile, someone who wants to use Jabber and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> goes to the  list of certified clients knows that the features on one 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client that are  part of the certification (such as, say, file 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transfer) /will/ work with  the other certified clients on the list.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if I'm on Windows, and I  have a friend on MacOS X, I can point 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them at a MacOS X Jabber client on  the certified list, pick a Windows 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client myself, and know that the file  transfer between them will work 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because both are certified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To me this sounds like: if we have a certification for clients it will  
</I>&gt;<i> help our end user pick clients that work together. And who would not 
</I>&gt;<i> agree  with that? Perhaps you think that having a framework for 
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility  will also increase the rate of adoption for features. You 
</I>&gt;<i> could be right,  which would validate the piece of text I quoted from 
</I>&gt;<i> the beginning of the  thread. I don't *think* it will matter a great 
</I>&gt;<i> deal, but I admit I'd be  lieing if I said I am sure you are wrong on that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If your driving force is compatibility though, you should really focus 
</I>&gt;<i> on  *that*. After all, if you fail on that all of the attractions it 
</I>&gt;<i> brings  along to users and developers (including the potential speed up 
</I>&gt;<i> in feature  adoption) will fade away with it. Is it still a good idea 
</I>&gt;<i> then to bring  experimental JEPs into this process?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You were right on the mark opening this thread that what matters to 
</I>&gt;<i> users  is not JEPs but features. However the process through which these 
</I>&gt;<i> features  evolve often involves not on but many JEPs and JEP revisions 
</I>&gt;<i> steered by a  whole bunch of different factors; technical reviews, the 
</I>&gt;<i> energy put into  them by their respective authors, compromises, 
</I>&gt;<i> politics, etc. To &quot;certify&quot;  something when it's in the middle of that 
</I>&gt;<i> process..? I don't think you  should expect (or encourage!) widespread 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;certified&quot; implementation and  usage before that process has ended, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the feature has &quot;emerged&quot;,  accompanied by fairly stable JEPs (which 
</I>&gt;<i> usually means there's some form  of implementation ready too).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this is at the core of your worries; the process for those 
</I>&gt;<i> features  to emerge through the JEP process can be agonizingly slow. And 
</I>&gt;<i> having  certifications can speed this up! All this really accomplishes 
</I>&gt;<i> is that we  have a simular process parralell to the JEP proces. We'd 
</I>&gt;<i> have &quot;certified&quot;  clients using avatars, we'd have certified clients 
</I>&gt;<i> publishing their music  info and with filetransfers. Because yes, those 
</I>&gt;<i> clients excist today, for  example avatars can be found in quite a few 
</I>&gt;<i> (they just don't have the  certified sticker)! They just do this in ways 
</I>&gt;<i> we've declared to obsolete  (in this case through presence instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> pubsub, through HTTP or DTCP  instead of Bytestreams, etc.). If we had 
</I>&gt;<i> this certification proces I don't  think the number of clients who would 
</I>&gt;<i> have implemented those obsolete ways  would be that much greater either. 
</I>&gt;<i> The very reason those ways are declared  obsolete is cause a large part 
</I>&gt;<i> of the developers do not agree with the  methods used. Nor would we have 
</I>&gt;<i> more clients who adopted the new ways  (because these are limited by 
</I>&gt;<i> others factors, the JEPs are still new,  server infrastructure is still 
</I>&gt;<i> missing (eg. IBB)), nor would it have sped  up the creation of new JEPs 
</I>&gt;<i> (having an installed base of the  old-now-obsolete experimental JEP that 
</I>&gt;<i> is also &quot;certified&quot; won't do much  good there!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If your worry truly is that the emergence of features through the JEP  
</I>&gt;<i> process is slow (and I think you wouldn't be the only one), I think the  
</I>&gt;<i> only solution for *that* would be try and improve that process.  
</I>&gt;<i> Suggestions and discussion on this subject have been done before ofcourse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But if you *do* choose to wait for features to mature it greatly  
</I>&gt;<i> simplifies the process of picking which ones should be put in the  
</I>&gt;<i> different profiles of certification (basic client, advanced client, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc.).  It's been suggested that one person should manage those 
</I>&gt;<i> profiles. The  reasoning for that is simple if you consider putting 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;features&quot; in that  not yet stabilized (in other words, the JEPs aren't 
</I>&gt;<i> done yet), you'll  never (well not quickly anyway) agree on what 
</I>&gt;<i> features to put in it. If  you stick to stable features, it will be 
</I>&gt;<i> relativly easy to reach agreement  amongst the people for who this 
</I>&gt;<i> certification is most important -and who  the whole idea of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;certification&quot; depends on for becoming a succes- the  authors of the 
</I>&gt;<i> various clients. Ofcourse you can still have 1 person to  oversee all this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just to be sure, I think these arguments are valid for both 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;recommended&quot;  and &quot;required&quot; features. If you intend to give the 
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of  &quot;recommended&quot; features so little importance it does 
</I>&gt;<i> not matter at all for  certification, you shouldn't put it in the 
</I>&gt;<i> certification then. Cause all  you'd be doing then is duplicating the 
</I>&gt;<i> JEP process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Such a certification could have great benifits. Even if it won't speed  
</I>&gt;<i> things up much, it would certainly enable the Jabber community to grow 
</I>&gt;<i> as  a whole (eg. look at the recent flare up in the PubSub discussion). 
</I>&gt;<i> I  would be carefull with what you call certification though, writing a  
</I>&gt;<i> profile for clients and what they should implement is one thing, 
</I>&gt;<i> checking  wether a client entirely adheres to that specification *that* 
</I>&gt;<i> could be  called certification, but that is a difficult and costly 
</I>&gt;<i> proces. Just  having the specifications for the different profiles (as 
</I>&gt;<i> agreed by the  major participants with an intrest of forming these 
</I>&gt;<i> specs) and some  organizing for interop. testing could still get you a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of the benefits!  (As Stephen Pendleton suggested, real 
</I>&gt;<i> certification might become an  intresting commercial opportunity)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It could all start rather more humble though.. for example, what about  
</I>&gt;<i> submitting some Jabber client profiles in the form of an informational JEP?
