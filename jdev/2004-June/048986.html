<PRE>Hi,

I'm relatively new to the Jabber world but it seems very promising in
its potential to add extreme value to all of a company's processes by
enabling fast, agile and customizable communication to everyone in the
organization.

But then again i'm not selling the thing... :-) So here's the question,
I need to have a central database of users, like a roster, so that if I
install jabber on a new machine at the company, he'll have everyone on
that central database added to his list automatically. Whenever someone
is removed from the db, that person is removed from everyone's list as
well. Whenever someone is added to the db, that person is added to
everyone's list. Is this possible w/ jabber? Or is there a solution that
already does this?

The problem I've seen so far w/ most clients is that to add someone to
your list u need their permission, and this would require the opposite,
this would require the db to go into the person's list and modify it on
the fly. Modify everyone's list for that matter.

I eagerly await feedback on this question,

Thanks a lot,
Jo&#227;o Carlos Martins
