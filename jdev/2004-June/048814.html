Interesting, where can I read about this distinction? Is this discussed
in the XMPP spec?

</I>
Why do you say this? I'm just trying to understand the reasons why
certain decisions were made. I'm sure the decision was logical but I
just can't see it.

&gt;<i> Maybe in some cases other addressing of the server may be usable, but
</I>&gt;<i> with other meaning -- e.g. administrator could read/write private storage
</I>&gt;<i> of other users or the server could have own private storage shared or
</I>&gt;<i> not associated with any user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
My applications requires extension to private storage, namely
administrator r/w access to users private storage. My non-IM clients
will read their configuration information from their private storage.
Some how my admin needs to create, modify and store those configurations
in the user's storage space as the admin, not the user.

&gt;<i> Stanzas addressed from a client's full JID to the same JID and not even
</I>&gt;<i> generated by the client seems stupid and not logical to me. We should
</I>&gt;<i> get rid of that whereever it is possible. Unfortunately we can't drop it
</I>&gt;<i> completely because of backward compatibility.
</I>
I assumed backward compatibility was why it was a bit different. I've
seen the evolution of the protocol through various JEPs. Everything is
making great progress. I may just abandon the iq:private space and
implement everything with data forms and adhoc commands, seeing that
that is the direction things are moving.

Have a good weekend everybody!
