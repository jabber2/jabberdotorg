Protocols do not move forward by sheer will of the council. The 
/reason/ those JEPs are /still/ experimental is because of lack of 
implementation attempts. If we had a compliance board, and the board 
said &quot;ok, we're going to try to have Avatars as part of the 2005 
compliance spec&quot;, then client authors would start working on 
implementing avatars, and the JEP would start changing and moving 
forward. Obviously if the JEP is not finalized in time for the 2005 
compliance tests it can only be &quot;recommended&quot; at best and not an actual 
requirement, but it will have pushed the client authors to attempt to 
implement a JEP, and by extension, pushed the JEP forward.

JEPs do not move forward by sheer will of Council or JEP authors. 
Client-based JEPs need client implementations to test them and work out 
bugs... and then the Council can start moving things forward based on 
real experience.

How many test implementations of jep-secure are there?
