The DTCP argument is old and dead.  It was a matter of multiple 
standards doing the same job coming out at the same time and then 
people pushing and shoving to make something move to the head of the 
class.  That issue is over and dead, let's move past it, we're big kids 
now.

As to the council opinion, implementations are fine, but if you're 
using a &quot;real&quot; JEP and it's experimental, than it's expected that 
you'll use the current version and then whatever becomes draft.  We 
can't have ideas that are just written down, they need to be tested.  
This is also, related to the recent council discussion about not as 
quickly accepting or pushing JEPs through the process, and using the 
wiki more.

JEP-Secure has political issues and you know that.  Don't make 
statements that are loosely blaming other people for that hold up.  
There's no reason not to be implementing it and figuring out what the 
problems are.  For the JEP-84 mods there's no way I would be ready to 
update it if I had not started implementing it in Gabber2.  I 
immediately found many practical problems with the described methods, 
and how I initially thought I could fix them.
