<PRE>Hello,

	It all makes sense to me ... I think it is a great idea.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; And Tkabber _still_ does DTCP based File Transfer instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Bytestreams.  Yay
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; for standards.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Then Tkabber fails its compliance and certification test.  Which is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fine if they don't care, but they lose the little badge and get 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; bumped from the list of certified clients; the clients on the list 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; implement file transfer as per spec, and thus if you download one you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; know it'll file transfer with any other one on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This seems more like an argument FOR certification than against. ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because the reward Tkabber gets for being one of the first to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement experimental JEPs (this is what you were aiming for right?) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is that it doesn't get certification?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't get it :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What good does it do them to have DTCP now?  Does a user who grabs 
</I>&gt;<i> tkabber care why it uses DTCP instead of bytestreams?  All they care 
</I>&gt;<i> about, as an end-user, is that Tkabber doesn't do file transfer with 
</I>&gt;<i> other modern clients.  It doesn't interact with them in the required 
</I>&gt;<i> featureset, it doesn't get certification.  Period.  Tkabber doesn't get 
</I>&gt;<i> punished for implementing an experimental JEP.  Tkabber loses 
</I>&gt;<i> certification because it didn't keep up-to-date with current stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Assume DTCP is something /not/ on the certification list at all, and 
</I>&gt;<i> Tkabber chooses to implement it.  That's their choice.  Later, 
</I>&gt;<i> bytestreams and /si/profile/file-transfer come out, and that /does/ 
</I>&gt;<i> become 'recommended' under the certification.  Tkabber chooses not to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement the recommendation, and gets their certification that year 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway because it's not a requirement.  But then, the next year, file 
</I>&gt;<i> transfer is a requirement.  Tkabber still chooses not to implement it, 
</I>&gt;<i> staying with DTCP.  Now this year they don't get their certification, 
</I>&gt;<i> because they no longer support current features of Jabber.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I shouldn't really define certification as something you 'lose'; it'd 
</I>&gt;<i> be something you have to strive to /gain/ each year.  If you don't want 
</I>&gt;<i> to make changes to your client, that's fine.  You don't suffer 
</I>&gt;<i> anything, you just don't get a new little badge with a new year on it, 
</I>&gt;<i> and you don't get in the next year's list of certified clients.  
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, someone who wants to use Jabber and goes to the list of 
</I>&gt;<i> certified clients knows that the features on one client that are part 
</I>&gt;<i> of the certification (such as, say, file transfer) /will/ work with the 
</I>&gt;<i> other certified clients on the list.  So if I'm on Windows, and I have 
</I>&gt;<i> a friend on MacOS X, I can point them at a MacOS X Jabber client on the 
</I>&gt;<i> certified list, pick a Windows client myself, and know that the file 
</I>&gt;<i> transfer between them will work because both are certified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I dunno, maybe I'm off on a completely wrong tangent, but it just seems 
</I>&gt;<i> like it doesn't /harm/ the existing clients, but gives a way to 
</I>&gt;<i> encourage the adoption of various JEPs through the 'recommended' role 
</I>&gt;<i> -- it's not a requirement, but it gets activity on them, and a 
</I>&gt;<i> 'recommended' feature might end up being a 'required' feature the next 
</I>&gt;<i> year, so it'd be good to have the structure in there and be working on 
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just my $0.02 again.
