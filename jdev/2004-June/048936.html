<PRE>The &quot;recommended&quot; features are for the client developers, not the end 
users. The end users would see &quot;all these clients have the features of 
a basic Jabber client&quot; ... and we may provide a list of &quot;extra&quot; 
features particular clients have.

My point is that we do have the kind of featureset list you're talking 
about, and that's the required features. Recommended features are 
things that we tell the developers about, not really the users (except 
when attached to one particular client, by saying &quot;in addition to that, 
this client has also been certified with the following additional 
features!&quot;)

So yes, we are going to work on it from the side you're talking about 
as well. There will be an &quot;end-user friendly&quot; display of the /required/ 
features for a particular certification.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> client, that s/he's looking for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's also why I don't think &quot;recommended&quot; features in a

</I>&gt;<i> achieved a certain level of certification, the user should not be 
</I>&gt;<i> required to check further resources to see whether &quot;recommended&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> features are in that product, after all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a first step towards helping users choose a client, and as an 
</I>&gt;<i> eventual add-on to the certification effort, providing a (complete) 
</I>&gt;<i> list of clients that includes a feature-list that average users can 
</I>&gt;<i> understand, would already be very helpful. E.g., list &quot;group chat&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of naming the JEP, etc. If client programmers made sure that 
</I>&gt;<i> their implementation(s) of a specific feature are standards-complient, 
</I>&gt;<i> so that sending a file from one client to another should work properly 
</I>&gt;<i> with _any_ pair of clients, than that would be a huge help for 
</I>&gt;<i> potential Jabber users to get started by choosing a client that has 
</I>&gt;<i> what they need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the certification program would (eventually) work towards that end, 
</I>&gt;<i> it's a superb idea and definitely worth supporting. If, however, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> for bragging rights only, then I doubt its value. Especially if this 
</I>&gt;<i> should turn out to be a for-a-fee program, since purely hobbyist 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber coders would probably not be able, let alone willing, to shed
