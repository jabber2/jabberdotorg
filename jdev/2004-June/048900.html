Hi Bob, 

You're absolutely right about the need for archiving. Some pubsub systems
might keep history, but it may make more sense to use ATOM for archiving
(it sure beats mbox ;-). Unfortunately the ATOM spec is even more fluid
than pubsub, it seems. But it would be good to include an ATOM URL as
metadata for a pubsub node, I think.

(First JDEV message I'm sending via Gmane... ;-)

Peter
