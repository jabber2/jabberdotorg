<PRE>&gt;<i> Ms. Blackman is not advocating certification for its own sake.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> piece that I think was left unsaid was that there's all these cool 
</I>&gt;<i> specs for features, and users have a real desire to have those 
</I>&gt;<i> features, yet client haven't implemented them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a case in point, I refer to a fairly-recent thread in this very 
</I>&gt;<i> list on a &quot;deficiency of the protocol&quot;[1] for file transer.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> findings: not every client tested implemented file transfer according 
</I>&gt;<i> to spec. Yet the file transfer specs have been available for nearly a 
</I>&gt;<i> year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How could certification help?  If we had certification, it would be a 
</I>&gt;<i> certainty that a list of certified clients would be available.  A user 
</I>&gt;<i> could obtain the list of clients &quot;certified for file transfer&quot;, and 
</I>&gt;<i> know that their chances of success are vastly greater than if they 
</I>&gt;<i> just started downloading clients.
</I>
Yes!  Thank you for saying what I've been trying to say, in a much more 
concise and straightforward manner than I was. :)
