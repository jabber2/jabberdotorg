I can not say anything about differences, as I don't know xmpppy.
When I wanted to write a Jabber python project some time ago the only
library available was jabber.py, which I didn't like. I didn't like
custom XML parser and tree representation, not well suited for parsing
anything else than Jabber streams and bad support for Unicode (hints to
change my python encoding to UTF-8 were just ugly hacks). That is why
I started PyXMPP. In fact I wanted to write a Jabber server, but to test
PyXMPP features I started writting a simple text client. The client was
so interesting to me so I dropped the server ide and do CJC as my
primary project. PyXMPP is developed mainly for CJC. Then I wanted an
IRC gateway, so I have added component support to PyXMPP and wrote
JJIGW. And so on...

PyXMPP is developed mainly for my needs and the way I like. However
I hope other developers will like it the same way so it could become
something more that one-man-project. I know there are a few other
developers using (or trying to use PyXMPP).

&gt;<i> and when people should favour one or the other?
</I>
When they like more the one or the other. Each of them has its own way
of doing things.

&gt;<i> Most people would have to learn 2 libraries for that, you have the unique
</I>&gt;<i> perspective of already knowing at least one of them.
</I>
But without knowing the other it is hard to compare. And I am not sure
I want to know the other. If it is better, then all my work was not
needed ;-)

&gt;<i> Any plans to merge them (pyxmpppy?)? 
</I>
I don't think it makes sense. The architecture is quite different.

&gt;<i> Or to steal good ideas from the other?
</I>
That could be possible. Though, I prefer getting own idea than
&quot;stealing&quot; others (which, I know, sometimes is much better), however if
anybody thinks it makes sense and ports an idea from xmpppy to pyxmpp,
then I could add the feature to PyXMPP.

Greets,
