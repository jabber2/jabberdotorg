</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My inability to document the Jabberd 2 code base has been an continual

</I>
There's nothing about database structure in my doc's that couldn't be
achieved by spending a few minutes at a MySQL console.

&gt;<i> &gt; Documenting the code base for a one-person project is difficult.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could document the Jabberd 2 code base; however, I would need someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who could walk the code with me (because I cannot read C). Given the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scarcity of resources on the project, anyone who could do that would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to devote limited time that could otherwise be spent writing code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or fixing bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Learn to read C. Good code documents itself.
</I>
I've actually started to do that; however, my efforts have been
half-hearted because I wonder if it's worth a huge time investment.  I
could learn to read C; however, the Jabberd 2 code base is not a starter
project.  

My primary concern is that if I wrote it, would they (developers) come? 
My second concern is that at the moment, it seems that I would be working
alone.  Even having a friend to bounce things off of would help; however,
none of my friends code C.  Lastly, I doubt that I will ever code C, nor
is it likely that I will need to document it professionally, so I'd need
to feel very confident that the time investment would pay off for Jabberd
2.

&gt;<i> &gt; In my mind, the question remains as to why these projects have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one-person projects.  I feel that the implementation language is part
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the problem.  Lack of official sponsorship from the JSF may be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another. Lack of financial sponsorship may be a third issue, and from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what I read, financial support is not likely to change soon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One problem with financial sponsorship is who's going to pay for it? The
</I>&gt;<i> JSF? Where's the JSF going to get money? Jabber, Inc.? They're not going
</I>&gt;<i> to shoot themselves in the foot by paying for a free server. Other
</I>&gt;<i> people around the JSF need to start making some money from Jabber. Only
</I>&gt;<i> then will&quot;we depend on jabberd, we better hire some one to work on it&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> become a reality.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Did the Apache, Mozilla, and RedHat project leaders have any other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advice on how to attract and retain contributors for collaborative OS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects? I suspect there is a lot of accumulated wisdom among these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leaders -- it never ceases to amaze me how these large OS projects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have so many active contributors, each of which plays a specific role.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to take a guess--money. I imagine major contributors to the
</I>&gt;<i> large OS projects one way or another benefit from them enough that they
</I>&gt;<i> invest in them.
</I>
Money never hurts; however, I have to believe that there are large-scale
collaborative OS projects that have limited funding.  Perhaps Apache,
Mozilla and Redhat are not good examples.
