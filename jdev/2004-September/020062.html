Joe Average definitely doesn't want to run and manage his own server. That's
why I talked about ISPs running Jabber servers.
 
&gt;<i> It would be great if I could send a message to someone that just posted

I've been thinking about Jabberfying MyPasswordSafe, the password manager I
wrote that still needs quite a bit of work. I talked about it one night in
the jdev room. I need to invest some time into working on it. To many
things to do, so little time.
 
&gt;<i> Thoughts? Other suggestions for killer apps? How could you get your
</I>&gt;<i> sister in law to switch to Jabber? :)
</I>
By unplugging the phone and refusing to communicate with her except through
Jabber. :-)
