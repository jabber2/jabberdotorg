I did think about such a community site a lot these days. And I'm very
glad that you happen to start the discussion on this.

Your idea of such a community site has a very technical point of view.
It's more a end-user site than a community site. 

I would suggest to build a community site whereas community means for me
that it offers users a wide range of services (certainly all built upon
jabber if possible) additionally to those end-user informations. Users
would a have:

* a personal account of course (which is a jabber account
simultaneously)
* a searchable profile (which merges with the user's vcard of course)
* a blog which can be edited from within jabber (just like the one at
amessage.info). the blog also offers an rss-feed for each user
* a service like jabrss that is customizable by web (additionally)
* forums (with rss-feeds) [not only for help! - on every topic]
* web-integration for groupchats (list them with descriptions, show logs
if available etc.)
* and last but not least a web based jabber client so that they can
start immediately ;-)
... to be continued ...

-Steve
