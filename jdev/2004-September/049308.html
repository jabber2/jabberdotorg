</I>
Email can be understood with real world experience since it has a lot of
similarities with snail mail :
email address &lt;-&gt; postal address
mailbox &lt;-&gt; mailbox
etc
but what about :
jabber server ? transports ?

Currently no ISP gives Jabber accounts. So what we have to deal with is
users who decided to use Jabber, and those users need to grasp far too
many concepts.

&gt;<i> So why aren't ISPs giving out Jabber accounts yet? That's gotta do with the
</I>&gt;<i> state of our code-bases. An ISP isn't going to setup a buggy, incomplete,
</I>&gt;<i> and hard to manage server. They need the equivalent of an Apache, something
</I>&gt;<i> they do setup and use.
</I>
I think a poll would be nice here. I think you are one step too far with
this ISP story : ISPs don't see the need for jabber servers since nobody
uses Jabber. And nobody uses Jabber because it is difficult to grasp and
poorly documented.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2) The number of clients/libraries/servers. For somebody coming to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber, it is very difficult to choose a client. There's no comparative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; charts saying &quot;this one does this, but doesn't do this, etc ...&quot;. There's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.php,">http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.php,</A> but I find it quite useless.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's the same problem for libraries. There are for example 4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different libraries in python (jabberpy, xmpppy, pyxmpp, twisted). How
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do they compare with each other ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tell your friends I use this client. Set it up for them. Get them to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> If they like it, they won't go looking for a new one. If they do go
</I>&gt;<i> looking, maybe they'll find something better or worse. Word of mouth should
</I>&gt;<i> be good, except for the isolated adventurer.
</I>
This way to work doesn't scale well. People should have other (easy) ways to 
choose a client than asking their neightboors.

&gt;<i> Though client reviews won't hurt. Contribute them to Linux Journal or
</I>&gt;<i> something. It would get the word out too which results in people doing
</I>&gt;<i> what's described in the above paragraph.
</I>
Still, probably a bit too technical : we would miss our target.

&gt;<i> &gt; B. do something like the Apache Software Foundation : best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clients/libraries/servers should be endorsed by the JSF, so users would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be able to choose between a restricted number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clients/libraries/servers. Of course, criterias for the selection should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include things like : - the code must be documented.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - the licence must be free.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - stuff like a public CVS, a bugzilla, etc ... must be available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See jabberstudio.org. It could be improved to point people towards specific
</I>&gt;<i> projects. I know SourceForge.net does more than just host projects (ie:
</I>&gt;<i> Most active, popular, etc.).
</I>
See <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/.">http://www.apache.org/.</A> 50% of the projects on jabberstudio.org are
either unmaintained or dead. Don't get me wrong, this is great : people
do experience with Jabber a lot. But still, people don't want to test 20
clients before finding one that suits their needs. So a list of usable
clients/libs/components/servers, with their features, would be great.

&gt;<i> &gt; All those ideas are non-technical work. I think that technical work has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proven to be unsuccessful with solving the jabber community problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll beg to differ on that point. The lack of technical work is the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> If tech work was unsuccessful, stpeter's mantras wouldn't all be &quot;...more
</I>&gt;<i> code&quot;. They would be &quot;Less code, more process&quot;. Anti-mantra #1. :-)
</I>
To summarize :
Problem: &quot;There a too many unusable or undocumented clients/servers.&quot;
Solution: &quot;Let's do another one !&quot;
Does it sound right ?
