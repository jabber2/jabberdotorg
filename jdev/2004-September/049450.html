Well, the discussion is rather old in some way. Take a look at AIM-t: It'd
be no problem to update libfaim and adding server-side buddy support to
AIM-t. However, no one dares to touch AIM-t's C code for quite some time
now (apart from small changes). C ist just no fun.

Apart from this, as a server administrator I really don't want to run a C
transport on my machine. Who knows how many security problems either the
protocol libraries or the Jabber glue code have? For example, as
libfaim/AIM-t neither use the memory pool concept Jabberd uses (or
something similar) nor use some decent string handling library, I bet
there are several severe security problems buried there (as have been in
Gaim's past).

And please, don't rise the &quot;performance issue&quot;. For example, C AIM-t
doesn't have a performance issue. It just stops to work properly with many
concurrent connections (as AOL blocks the complete IP if there are too
many unsuccessful logins from one IP which AIM-t doesn't take care for -
that's a software problem no one cared to take a look at!). Plus it has
memory leaks all over the place. With these issues, we don't have to talk
about &quot;performance&quot;. ;-)
