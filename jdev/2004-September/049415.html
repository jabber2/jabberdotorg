</I>
This is what I brought up as a mere idea on the list only a couple of months 
ago.  The idea I got was that GAIM might be hard to wrap up into a transport.

The only difference with my idea is that I had suggested using JCR, which is a 
C library for writing transports... well actually, it's a C library for 
recompiling Jabberd 1.4 transports so that they run standalone.

&gt;<i> The advantages I can see in this approach are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) a single transport gateway instead of 5 or 6;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) the Gaim guys really do know their protocols and my wrapping should be
</I>&gt;<i> pretty forward compatible should the protocol implementations need to
</I>&gt;<i> change;
</I>
And thus, much lower code maintenance, yes.  If this gets really stable, then 
when a problem comes along in a protocol (e.g. Yahoo change for the twelfth 
time in the year or something -- exaggeration, yes) it will literally be a 
job of &quot;upgrade GAIM&quot;... okay, done.  Since GAIM is entirely based around 
plugins, this should work by their design. :-)

&gt;<i> 1) the wrapping is done in perl (which I like, but others might not);
</I>
Perl isn't so bad.  An advantage is that it's on pretty much every system 
already (although, modules are the usual snag!)  A disadvantage is that... I 
dunno.  The language isn't as clean as Python, sure, but it's not _too_ bad.

It's probably easier to maintain than the pure C thing I proposed, but I 
wonder.  The C thing wouldn't need the SWIG stuff and could just link 
directly to the GAIM libs.  That's the only major benefit I can see with C.

&gt;<i> 2) building requires you to be able to build Gaim which in turn isn't
</I>&gt;<i> always the easiest of tasks;
</I>
Building GAIM is easy enough... if you're on Ports or Portage. :-D
But I think even my solution would have resulted in something like this,
unless I went ahead and cloned their whole plugin framework.

&gt;<i> So, I just wondered what the pros thought and whether this is something
</I>&gt;<i> which I should bother to package up and submit somewhere for more general
</I>&gt;<i> use?  If so, I'll bung it on a public jabberd for people to stress-test it
</I>&gt;<i> for a while.
</I>
Stress testing sounds like a great idea.  I was always wondering how GAIM 
would perform with 100 users on each protocol instead of 1 or 2.  This will 
be the test, I suppose.

Maybe if the performance is taking a huge hit, there's a way to profile it to 
figure out where the time goes.  If it does go in the Perl interpretation, 
then we can think about porting the code.  If not, we can just panic since it 
will be too hard to change GAIM itself into a server. ;-)
