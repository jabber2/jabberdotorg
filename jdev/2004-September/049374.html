Just an idea, one could get VERY much functionality by providing a RDF
representation of the roster. Of course, this needs heavy work on the
server and client side, but I think it's worth the hassle. I'll explain:

RDF is basically a way of describing graphs (that nodes-and-edges thing
;-) in XML. Imagine the nodes being URIs/JIDs and the edges being
relations such as &quot;is-subscribed-to&quot;, &quot;has-access-to-roster-of&quot;,
&quot;is-member-of-group&quot;, or &quot;is-present-in-roster&quot;. Then we can easily say

&quot;(me) is-subscribed-to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">a at jabber.org</A>&quot;
&quot;(me) is-subscribed-to aim.jabber.org&quot;
&quot;aim.jabber.org has-access-to-roster-of (me)&quot;
&quot;aim.jabber.org is-present-in-roster (PalmRoster)&quot;

without having to invent much custom XML. Also, as RDF parsers and query
engines are already available, for example queries such as &quot;Retrieve
roster: I only want items with satisfy [is-present-in-roster
(PalmRoster)]&quot; are trivial. We don't need to invent another query
language.

There are also many other kinds of server-side XML/RDF storage along with
query engines. For example, this can be used for server-side message log
storage without *any* need for complex server-side support as RDF storage
and query engines are already available. Or imagine FOAF RDF
(<A HREF="http://www.foaf-project.org/">http://www.foaf-project.org/</A>) stored in the user's personal RDF
repository on his Jabber server. :-)

That's just an idea and certainly needs some more thoughts. However, this
seems to be much more powerful but relatively cheap with regards to the
need for server-side code in the long run.
