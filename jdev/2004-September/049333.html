Perhaps we should set up sites documenting this. Some time ago there were
Admin FAQs/HowTos on jabber.org but they have vanished. Now, there are
only some &quot;neutral&quot; lists of server/client software which are not really
of great help as they are too brief.

What about setting up a Server FAQ or adding info to the jadmin FAQ? I'd
propose to put it into jabber.org's Wiki and providing a link directly to
that page on the jabber.org front page. I'll monitor the page (as I do
with the Wiki anyways as nobody else seems to care for the spam that
showed up the last weeks there ;-). STPeter?

I don't see the problem as the protocol jabber.org uses is not too far
away from XMPP. However, the Jabber server running on jabber.org leaves
room for improvement certainly.
