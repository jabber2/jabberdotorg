I had the chance to spend a day in Cupertino back in June and talked to
the developer from Apple who will be doing the work on the server. He
wanted to use jabberd2, but noticed how often it went out to lunch. So
then he looked at jabberd 1.4.3 and he had less problems with it. I'm
fairly sure he will be using jabberd-1.4.3 for the server. The problem is
he wants sasl support so he can put kerberos V support in the code.
