<PRE>Hi James &amp; all others.

What is 'wrong' with using JEP-0093 (jabber:x:roster) after a disco or caps to the client? I am using '93 within my yahoo-transport.

The only change in the logic would be:

1 User registers with msn.host.com
2 Transport does disco or caps comparison to see if '93 is supported, client advertises the jabber:x:disco feature.
3 If '93 is supported then provide a roster exchange list to which the client can decide what to do with (user configurable), or go through old method of sending a subscription for each
(or just sending a '93 anyway which is what I do).

As you are already checking for the registered hostname the logic is easier and a lot of clients already support '93 so you loose nothing in real terms.

Please correct me if I have made a major error in logic.

Thanks

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current situation is:
</I>&gt;<i> * A user with an account on a legacy service will have a legacy contact list 
</I>&gt;<i> that will need to be synchronised with their Jabber contact list by the 
</I>&gt;<i> gateway
</I>&gt;<i> * The current way that gateways do this is illegal according to XMPP. It also

</I>&gt;<i> * There are no existing protocols for shared roster groups, and we need a way

</I>&gt;<i> hassle.
</I>&gt;<i> * A user should not have to authorise all their legacy system contacts on 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber. They have already authorised them on the legacy service.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My proposal is an extension to the presence subscription packets (allowed by 
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP) which will work in such a way that existing clients will still function 
</I>&gt;<i> (the user will just have to authorise all their contacts again), but modified 
</I>&gt;<i> clients would work securely without bothering the user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An example flow with a modified client follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A user has been using MSN Messenger, and has acquired a large contact list on 
</I>&gt;<i> this service. The user has heard about Jabber and wants to try it out. They 
</I>&gt;<i> still want to be able to talk to their MSN friends, so they will use the MSN 
</I>&gt;<i> transport on their server (host.com)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * User registers with msn.host.com
</I>&gt;<i> * The transport obtains the user's MSN contacts from MSN servers and begins 
</I>&gt;<i> the import process
</I>&gt;<i> * The transport sends a series of packets looking like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;presence from=&quot;user%<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">hotmail.com at msn.host.com</A>&quot; to=&quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host.com</A>&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;subscribe&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;import/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/presence&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The user's client notices the import tag, and checks to see if the user's 
</I>&gt;<i> contact list contains msn.host.com. It does, so the client then prompts the 
</I>&gt;<i> user in order to double-check that this entity is allowed to send roster 
</I>&gt;<i> imports to the user's contact list.
</I>&gt;<i> * The user gives the affirmative. From now on all presence type=subscribe 
</I>&gt;<i> packets originating from the msn.host.com domain will be automatically 
</I>&gt;<i> authorised by the client.
</I>&gt;<i> * The effect for the user is that by registering with the MSN gateway, and 
</I>&gt;<i> answering yes to one prompt, they now have their entire MSN contact list 
</I>&gt;<i> available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the user had been using an existing client, they would need to answer yes 
</I>&gt;<i> to every subscription request, but they will still receive their contact list 
</I>&gt;<i> at the end of it. That's the advantage of using this method, any client will 
</I>&gt;<i> support it, and all can be easily modified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rules for the client:
</I>&gt;<i> * If the client receives a presence subscription packet with an import tag, 
</I>&gt;<i> but the originating domain is not on the user's contact list the client MUST 
</I>&gt;<i> ignore the import tag, and treat the presence packet as normal. (this 
</I>&gt;<i> prevents arbitrary Jabber users from auto-authorising themselves)
</I>&gt;<i> * A client MUST check with the user at least once before auto-importing any 
</I>&gt;<i> contacts. The client SHOULD remember the user's answer for the duration of 
</I>&gt;<i> the session and MAY choose to remember the answer forever. (If the latter, 
</I>&gt;<i> then the transport will be able to transparently keep the user's contact list 
</I>&gt;<i> in sync, if for example it is modified using another legacy client)
</I>&gt;<i> * A client MUST NOT auto-authorise any contacts that do not have an import tag
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rules for the transport:
</I>&gt;<i> * The transport SHOULD send a presence packet with an import tag if the user 
</I>&gt;<i> has already authorised that contact on the legacy service.
</I>&gt;<i> * The transport MUST NOT send a presence packet with an import tag in any 
</I>&gt;<i> other case (eg, when a legacy user requests subscription for the first time)
</I>&gt;<i>
