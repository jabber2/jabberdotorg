</I>Really nice and ambitous but who's going to pay for all that :D You'll 
need quite a bit of bandwith if you want to create a site like this that 
people can also 'abuse' as just another blog/forums site :D

IMO the most important thing at the moment is making sure that people 
can get started with Jabber, that's just way to difficult at the moment. 
Other sites (for example pubsub.com) can offer these extra services :) 
BTW my community site idea didn't include a Jabber server, we don't want 
to have a central Jabber server and we don't want to compete with the 
other public servers out there. Besides that administrating a jabber 
server with several thousand (and later several millions :D) of user is 
hell :) IMO we should invest all that energy in improving the 
information on that site, other people (like Matthias) are much better 
at keeping public servers running :D
