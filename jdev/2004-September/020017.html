Do your docs describe Jabberd 2's database structure? I haven't entirely
made head or tails of how all the tables work together just from looking at
them.

Learn to read C. Good code documents itself.

</I>
One problem with financial sponsorship is who's going to pay for it? The
JSF? Where's the JSF going to get money? Jabber, Inc.? They're not going to
shoot themselves in the foot by paying for a free server. Other people
around the JSF need to start making some money from Jabber. Only then will
&quot;we depend on jabberd, we better hire some one to work on it&quot; become a
reality.
 
&gt;<i> Did the Apache, Mozilla, and RedHat project leaders have any other advice

</I>&gt;<i> I suspect there is a lot of accumulated wisdom among these leaders -- it

</I>
I'm going to take a guess--money. I imagine major contributors to the large
OS projects one way or another benefit from them enough that they invest in
them.

&gt;<i> As much as I hate to say it, I agree that both jabberd's are deficient

</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that putting the &quot;JSF stamp of approval&quot; on Jabberd 2 would change
</I>&gt;<i> the situation.
</I>
Take me to your benevolent dictator. :-)
