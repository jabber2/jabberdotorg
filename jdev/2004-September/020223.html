<PRE>Recently there has been a lot of list traffic to determine ways to promote XMPP/Jabber adoption. I think I see a good way.

Eclipse (<A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org">http://www.eclipse.org</A>) is both a popular application development IDE and a Java application platform. The Eclipse developers just introduced the Eclipse Communications Project (<A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/ecomm/index.html">http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/ecomm/index.html</A>) whose goal &quot;is to provide an open source, peer-to-peer messaging and communications framework for the Eclipse platform&quot;.

When I read the list of technical features, XMPP/Jabber already provide much of what they want to accomplish. Maybe they're already thinking about using XMPP/Jabber without actually saying so.

I thought some on this list might want to participate in the Eclipse Communications Project in some way.
