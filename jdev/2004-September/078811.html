Smack is actually a Java library for writing Jabber/XMPP clients, not a 
client itself. Another client to consider is Java Stream Objects (JSO), 
which supports the writing of clients, components, and servers:

<A HREF="http://jso.jabberstudio.org/">http://jso.jabberstudio.org/</A>

FWIW, my understanding is that there is heavy interest in JSO within Sun.

Smack and JSO seem to be the two most popular and actively maintained 
Java libs for Jabber/XMPP development.

&gt;<i> &quot;With ecomm, we will be providing Eclipse-based abstract apis for access to

</I>&gt;<i> should give us (and ecomm developers) the maximum flexibility to interoperate 
</I>&gt;<i> with different existing and new protocols.&quot;
</I>
How do the Eclipse &quot;reference implementations&quot; relate to JSRs within the 
Java Community Process?

<A HREF="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/overview">http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/overview</A>

Naturally it would be good to get XMPP support into the &quot;standard&quot; 
libraries for most major programming languages (Java, Python, Perl, 
etc.), and the Eclipse effort might be a step in that direction.

&gt;<i> &quot;As I understand it, [IETF/Jabber.org] are trying to define a consistent 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol for IM server-side interoperability.
</I>
Well, XMPP is just streaming XML -- mainly used for IM, but also for 
many other applications, from network management to real-time gaming. 
XMPP is mostly implemented via a client-server architecture, but could 
be used peer-to-peer as well (cf. iChat in Rendezvous mode).

&gt;<i> I consider ecomm's effort to 
</I>&gt;<i> be focused on delivering communications apis to Eclipse plugin developers 
</I>&gt;<i> (primarily, but not only), so that applications can be easily constructed to 
</I>&gt;<i> take advantage presence info, messaging, peer-to-peer communication, etc.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> believe if approached in the right way, these can be complimentary...with 
</I>&gt;<i> ecomm apis providing plugin developers with access to open communications 
</I>&gt;<i> protocols (like XMPP), and allowing the rapid creation of Eclipse-based apps 
</I>&gt;<i> that interoperate with other XMPP clients/devices.&quot;
</I>
Sounds good. :-)
