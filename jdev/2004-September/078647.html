There are a number of people interested in working on a simple Jabber 
server in Python, and I know one person who said he might start work on 
the &quot;kernel&quot; of such a server this month if he finds the time. But 
nothing exists right now.

&gt;<i> Nor could I find a library that would allow me to easily craft my own

</I>
Well, even XMPP Core is non-trivial (SASL, TLS, stringprep, etc.). You 
might look at pyxmpp -- Jacek has done a lot of work to make it XMPP 
compliant:

&gt;<i> I'm not against starting to write one myself based on Twisted - but I

</I>
The problem with Twisted, at least accordingly to the developers I've 
chatted with, is that it's something of a way of life. :-)

&gt;<i> p.s. Posting via Gmane doesn't work - even after the verification process.
</I>
Yes it does, because I'm posting from it right now. Your email address 
needs to be subscribed to the list, however (but you can set the options 
to &quot;nomail&quot; so that you don't receive email from mailman).
