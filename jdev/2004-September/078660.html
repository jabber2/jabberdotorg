In each solution, it's going to take either an upgrade of clients and 
transports, or an upgrade of servers and transports.  Normally anything that 
requires a server upgrade is considered difficult (which is unfortunate, 
because sometimes it is the right way), however in this case it might 
actually be easier, since the admin must already go out of his way on the 
server-side because he has to upgrade his transports.

See what I mean?  It's not something that just the clients can solve this 
time.  It's msn-t also, which is a server component.  And those servers that 
don't upgrade their msn-t will be giving inconsistent user experiences 
anyway, regardless of which solution we go with.  This is one of those rare 
situations where upgrading the server side is likely the easier path.
