<PRE>&gt;<i> them?  Let's do it right the first time, please.
</I>
I think this is one of the major problems with the way Jabber is going
right now. If we do this 'the right way', it will take year(s) until it
is actually approved, implemented, and active. And without better 
transport handling, i really don't see other people of the masses use
Jabber for their daily use. This is a minor change to clients and
transports, which breaks nothing, and which could improve user experience 
a lot. Removing the feature when a better protocol arrives should be
peanuts.

Don't get me wrong, i also want to do this right the first time. I just
lost my faith in the whole process of approving and getting protocols
active in Jabber. Although it is a very extensible protocol, it always seems 
to me that it will still take years before Jabber is really active, and
who knows, it might be leaping behind on other IM services by then.

Just my 2 cents.

cheers,
Remko
