Hang on there, cowboy.  If you started off talking about email, why don't you 
use an email server as your example here?  Are you trying to dodge something?

I guess that the best example of an email server in massive use would be 
Sendmail.  Sendmail's simplicity of configuration is an absolute joy, and it 
makes me wish I had to run a mail server, just so that I could have the 
pleasure of getting to configure it.

*coughs*

In Sendmail's defence, I suppose there are tons and tons of books on the 
subject, which simply isn't the case for Jabberd.  However, how much longer 
has Sendmail had to accumulate these books?  Did it have this many books in 
its opening years?
