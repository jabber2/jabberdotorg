<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> The features that users will ask for would be conference browsing,
</I>&gt;<i> whiteboarding, and chatting with other surfers, like in Nick Vidal's
</I>&gt;<i> email. Lluna (<A HREF="http://www.lluna.de/">http://www.lluna.de/</A>) is pretty much there.
</I>
Speaking about LLuna I'd like to give my 2 (Euro)cents:

My killer app is Virtual Presence. I am not aiming at moving MSN or AIM users over to use Jabber buddy lists. My goal is to get people to use the Jabber infrastructure without trying to teach them Jabber. I am trying to provide a new easy user interface for ad-hoc communication on Web pages. Actually it is just a different user interface for jabber group chat. But to users it does not appear as a chat channel where you open the chat client and enter a channel. Choosing and entering chat rooms is done automatically while they are browsing. 

Jabber is almost perfectly suited as the backbone network for Virtual Presence. Especially the distributed architecture fits very well to the architecture of the Web. I see a great chance to get lots of users for the Jabber infrastrucure. And finally also for the buddy list part. I hope there will be other Virtual Presence clients for Jabber. Some will also have buddy lists and users will be able to add people they meet on the Web to their buddy list. I hope that Jabber and not MSN or AIM push Virtual Presence. The &quot;proprietary&quot; IM networks could also build VP features on their networks. 

We are currently aiming at computer gamers, MMORPG and multiplayer RPG users. The goal is that users can walk on the Web with their in-game avatar. They invest months in avatar creation and leveling. If they could show their avatar on the Web then they get an additional value from their investment. Imagine you could use your Ultima Online, DAoC, or WoW character as your avatar to meet people on the Web. Game publishers seem to like the idea. And below all that fancy stuff is the Jabber network, lots of Jabber protocol features, Jabber servers, and Jabber rosters if people want to stay in contact after meeting by chance.
