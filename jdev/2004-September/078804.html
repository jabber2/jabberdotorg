<PRE>Nary a nibble?

I emailed the Eclipse Communications Project lead encouraging him to consider XMPP/Jabber as a &quot;standard and popular implementation technology&quot;. You may wish to do so as well.

He has already built an Eclipse IDE plug-in (<A HREF="http://composent.com/code/eclipsesite/">http://composent.com/code/eclipsesite/</A>) that provides many project features. I can't tell from that page what protocol he uses. Maybe it's one we can unseat if we try.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I see this new Eclipse Communications Project as the community's opportunity to bake Jabber client functionality directly into the IDE of a million(!?) Java programmers, and perhaps from there into their applications.

Please let's not squander it.

Regards,
John Liston


&gt;<i> Recently there has been a lot of list traffic to determine ways to promote XMPP/Jabber adoption.
</I>&gt;<i> I think I see a good way.
</I>
&gt;<i> Eclipse (<A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org">http://www.eclipse.org</A>) is both a popular application development IDE and a Java 
</I>&gt;<i> application platform. The Eclipse developers just introduced the Eclipse Communications Project 
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/ecomm/index.html">http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/ecomm/index.html</A>) whose goal &quot;is to provide an open source, 
</I>&gt;<i> peer-to-peer messaging and communications framework for the Eclipse platform&quot;.
</I>
&gt;<i> When I read the list of technical features, XMPP/Jabber already provide much of what they want 
</I>&gt;<i> to accomplish. Maybe they're already thinking about using XMPP/Jabber without actually saying so.
</I>
&gt;<i> I thought some on this list might want to participate in the Eclipse Communications Project in some way.
