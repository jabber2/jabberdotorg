Typically, changing some CSS file or template is enough. I don't see where
this is different from any CMS.

I think I understand you a bit better now. However, I don't see how this
can be done easily. Of course, one could simply set up a forum and hope
that users will use it or some community will form. But even considered
this succeeds, you'll eventually duplicate something which should normally
happen using Jabber: People talking to each other ;-). A nice thing would
certainly be something like a Jabber-powered forum which integrates
chatrooms and a WWW-based forum, also emphasizing Jabber's strengths and
flexibility this way. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any software
around that implements this.
