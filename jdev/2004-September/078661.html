I think it's not &quot;sometimes&quot; the right way, it's about *always* the right
way. It's very unfortunate that currently most server implementations are
more or less frozen - any major update is almost impossible as there are
stability problems or other &quot;more urgent&quot; issues.

Nobody's forced to upgrade his transports if we go James' way. And, of
course, for example upgrading PyMSN-t (which is done in some seconds as
all is needed is replacing some .py files) is WAY easier than upgrading
jabberd14/jabberd2/whatever.

&gt;<i> This is one of those rare situations where upgrading the server side is

Right now, we would need to quickly invent a protocol to implement Shared
Roster Groups. This would also need some kind of s2s authentication/
permissions protocol. This needs time. Of course, one can quickly think of
a simplified way to implement Shared Groups (&quot;any subscribed JID without a
username part may change our roster&quot;), but this is clearly a hack and
doesn't cover the amount of interesting use cases that could be covered
with a more elaborated approach (see my RDF idea).

So I'd really like to have some quick, simple, and backwards/
upwards-compatible solution which James' proposal seems to be. For now.
