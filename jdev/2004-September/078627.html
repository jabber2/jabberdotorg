That's why I think Jabberzilla will rock.

Well, your example was quite too simplistic so I will give a better one. 
Imagine this:

I'm chatting with a colleague. We are working together in a project. 
Let's say it's a project about butterflies.

So each one is searching the Web for good information about butterflies. 
Suddenly, I stumble upon an interesting page. Hey, I want to share this 
page with my collegue.

OK, I could just send him the link of the page. Or, even better, we 
could browse the page together. Hum, does the Jabber server support 
this? Hell no! But hey, you know what? It doesn't really matter. This is 
a &quot;client thing&quot;. Thanks to an .XPI extension called &quot;Browse Together&quot; 
we start browsing together the page. So I scroll down the page here, and 
the page gets scrolled down there. The chat window, once taking the 
whole area to itself, now is on the sidebar, and the Web page becomes 
the center of attention.

This colleague of mine finds an interesting photo in this page and he 
wants to show me something. He tells me about an .XPI entension called 
&quot;Paint Rush&quot;. Too bad I don't have it yet. No problem. All I have to do 
is download it. The installation is a breeze.

A new window is opened. The image he selected is now within some 
XUL-application. He, with a red marker, circles a spot in the wing of 
the butterfly. He explains the spot to me in the chat window located on 
the sidebar.

OK, time to get some work done. We will write a report about it on an 
on-line editor I recently found. Well, no need for an extension for 
this. It's a pure Web application. So we start writting some text as 
well as &quot;selecting and droping&quot; some text we wrote from our chat history 
(which btw is on the sidebar, getting swapped every now and them with 
the live chat window).

Voil&#225;. Each one of us saves a copy of the report to our local machines 
and we send the report to our teacher via e-mail.

IN SUMMARY: The Jabber Server doesn't have to support EVERYTHING. Just 
the basic: message, file-transfer. The Jabber Client doens't have 
support EVERYTHING neither. It needs to be 2 things: EXTENSIBLE and 
WELL-INTEGRATED. Jabberzilla, for that matter, promisses to be both.

But hey, you know what they say: &quot;Life is better with the butterfly&quot;! :)

Cheers,
Nick Vidal
