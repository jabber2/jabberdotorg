<PRE>Hi all,

Many moons ago, JC Brand started the XMPP Job Board site at
<A HREF="https://xmpp.work">https://xmpp.work</A> with the intent to bring together people that are
interested in having XMPP-related jobs and organisations that are looking
for developers, administrators and integrators who know XMPP.

Recently, JC indicated that he was looking for someone to take over
maintenance of the site. I am happy to do that. Earlier this week, JC and
myself finished migrating the site. Things should be fully functional again
(although the 'service provider' sections have been removed purposefully).

Please, give the site a test, and let me know if you find any issues. The
migration has likely caused all passwords to be reset. If you have an
account on xmpp.work, please use the password reset functionality in the
login screen to generate a new password.

Lastly, I'd like to call upon you for help: this site is only of value when
it holds relevant job listings.

If you know of a job opening, please add it to the site!
If you work for or with an organization that regularly is looking for XMPP
talent, ask your colleagues tasked with talent acquisition to add jobs to
xmpp.work!
If you can think of another source of jobs, please let me know!

Thank you!

Kind regards,

  Guus
