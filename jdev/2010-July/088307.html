<PRE>It could be that no updates = stability!  I have spent the last year
developing an XMPP Server and client in a non-IM space commercially and our
group seems to find new uses for them springing up all the time.  It's
honestly a difficult sell when people hear the word IM; the idea is often
dismissed; but I was able to sell it.  We decided to home-grow it because we
wanted to be in control of our releases, and we wanted to be able to do mini
mods without having to explain it to some other team, and we wanted to have
someone (me!) know all the intimate details of how it all works.

Honestly, the impetus and excitement for me came from Google with Google
Wave, who seems to have hijacked the standard.  However I was so pleased to
be able to go through the standard in one screen, and the code for the
client and server in another screen and tick off each piece of
functionality.  I built it from scratch, using .Net 3.5 and C# and have
enjoyed almost every minute of it.

So I would just like to conclude by saying that I stand on the shoulders of
all the engineers and enthusiast before me, and GREATLY APPRECIATE a well
thought out, standard, and foundation for something really wonderful.  So
Thanks!!

Matt Mason

Subject: [jdev] The future of Jabber/XMPP?

Hi there,

Today I noticed that there hasn't been an update to the Openfire Jabber
server in more than 14 months, where 2007 and 2008 have been very active
years. There's still a lot of open issues in the project. In the past
years, a few Jabber projects (like legacy IM gateways or PHP libraries)
have fallen asleep for indefinite time. The Psi developers push
long-desired features further and further into the future while the
Linux package downloads fall behind in versions. (Currently their
website it only half available.)

Sometime in the last decade I saw a more or less great momentum towards
open IM standards, with Google Talk and GMX/web.de introducing XMPP
services or Apple iChat supporting the protocol. Recently, Facebook also
joined the club (without s2s AFAIK), but I have the vague impression
that the whole thing slowly falls asleep. There hasn't been real great
leaps in the near past, or did I just miss them? Now even Google tries
to introduce yet another messaging protocol that isn't as verbose as XML
[citation needed].

Please don't tell me that Free Jabber is dying, because what's left
is... once again only ICQ, MSN and restrictive terms of service.
