<PRE>Further updates would be welcome, especially any insights from the
social web federation meeting on Sunday.

&gt;<i> We've been quietly working away on buddycloud.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now we're looking for feedback on our very very alpha version of the
</I>&gt;<i> web-client at <A HREF="http://buddycloud.com">http://buddycloud.com</A> and also get ideas on what to work
</I>&gt;<i> on next?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The website and mobile clients are built atop XMPP where users can log
</I>&gt;<i> in an participate in their own channels
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://buddycloud.com/user/buddycloud.com/simon">http://buddycloud.com/user/buddycloud.com/simon</A>), friends channels, or
</I>&gt;<i> topic channels (<A HREF="http://buddycloud.com/channel/football">http://buddycloud.com/channel/football</A>) and share
</I>&gt;<i> location in a meaningful way (&quot;I'm at home&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The basics of buddycloud are channels and location:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> buddycloud channels are built atop pub-sub and let you bring your own
</I>&gt;<i> jid to the party. A channel is somewhere between Twitter posts and IRC
</I>&gt;<i> conversation. The distinction depends on the particular channel and the
</I>&gt;<i> moderation team running it. Originally buddycloud channels were built on
</I>&gt;<i> MUC, then we tried using PEP. After much client and backend reworking,
</I>&gt;<i> we've settled on pub-sub as a much more flexible and robust solution.
</I>&gt;<i>  Using pub-sub also works better for mobile users who need a
</I>&gt;<i> low-overhead re-sync when they come back online.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Location (think &quot;I'm in East London, UK&quot;) and place (think &quot;I'm at home
</I>&gt;<i> sweet home&quot;) sharing are done using bookmarks of surrounding WiFi,
</I>&gt;<i> cell-id pattern or GPS coordinates (we're not really fans of the
</I>&gt;<i> check-in madness and you don't need to become a mayor of anything).
</I>&gt;<i> Location uses XEP-0255 and XEP-0080.  We're also working with the W3C's
</I>&gt;<i> location sharing and still keen to push the
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://oslo-protocol.googlecode.com">http://oslo-protocol.googlecode.com</A> for federated location sharing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We continue to believe that many social networks should exist and
</I>&gt;<i> federate with each other using open protocols like XMPP or the work of
</I>&gt;<i> the Ostatus team. Users should own their identity and content and
</I>&gt;<i> control their own privacy. We've tried to buidl buddycloud along these
</I>&gt;<i> lines and we are participating in the Ostatus summit to see how we can
</I>&gt;<i> make this happen for the non-XMPP world too.  This is our rough idea of
</I>&gt;<i> how things should work; I'm sure that there are some good jdev minds
</I>&gt;<i> that might want to add to this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We think our next step is to enable any XMPP server operator can run
</I>&gt;<i> their own channels and location components and to finish up the Android
</I>&gt;<i> and the iPhone clients (also all XMPP transport).  The Nokia client is
</I>&gt;<i> shipped.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All code is opensource and we are keen for more participants to join us:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - web-clients, widgets and the mobile clients are all on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://buddycloud.googlecode.com.">http://buddycloud.googlecode.com.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> - Smack for Android improvements are hosted on <A HREF="http://asmack.googlecode.com">http://asmack.googlecode.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are also looking for help, especially as we add more web
</I>&gt;<i> functionality. The next less-fugly version looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://m.buddycloud.com/tmp/proofs/20100702-web-channels-ng-outline.png">http://m.buddycloud.com/tmp/proofs/20100702-web-channels-ng-outline.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  and should be out in the coming weeks.  If you'd like to join in or
</I>&gt;<i> just watch progress we hang out in MUC: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">seehaus at channels.buddycloud.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To quickly summarise what turned out to be a much longer email, please
</I>&gt;<i> share how you think federated social networking built atop XMPP *should*
</I>&gt;<i> look and what you would like to see as a next step.
</I>&gt;<i>
