</I>
I've been involved with the Jabber/XMPP community since 1999 and I can't
tell you how many projects and people I've seen come and go. That kind
of turnover is natural.

&gt;&gt;<i> Sometime in the last decade I saw a more or less great momentum towards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open IM standards, with Google Talk and GMX/web.de introducing XMPP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> services or Apple iChat supporting the protocol. Recently, Facebook also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> joined the club (without s2s AFAIK), but I have the vague impression
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the whole thing slowly falls asleep. There hasn't been real great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leaps in the near past, or did I just miss them?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you missed them. XMPP seems to me stronger than ever, in the
</I>&gt;<i> IM space, but it is also doing surprisingly well in the non-IM
</I>&gt;<i> use-cases, where XMPP has turned out to be a very viable platform on
</I>&gt;<i> which to build all kinds of realtime data-pushing apps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I started the Prosody project a year or two back, and we now have a
</I>&gt;<i> strong community, growing all the time. People are joining us all the
</I>&gt;<i> time, whether from other inactive servers, from non-XMPP IM platforms
</I>&gt;<i> or because they are looking to build new services powered by XMPP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Depending on where you're viewing from, progress can look slow or
</I>&gt;<i> inexistent. However such is always the way, XMPP was never going to
</I>&gt;<i> take over the world overnight (though I never stop believing it may,
</I>&gt;<i> it helps :) ). It takes time for people already accustomed to the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;old&quot; ways to invest development time and effort into implementing or
</I>&gt;<i> switching existing infrastructure to use XMPP - so take-up always
</I>&gt;<i> appears to be slow.
</I>
XMPP technologies have always grown organically without any major buzz,
and they are still growing. But they've also matured and they're no
longer a new thing, so you find more energy right now in things like
social networking. That said, there are still plenty of applications
that need real-time interactivity and data delivery, and plenty of
people working with XMPP to build and deploy those applications.

&gt;<i> Anyway, as I said further up... whether and how well XMPP continues to
</I>&gt;<i> meet its goals is up to you, me, and everyone else on this list. If
</I>&gt;<i> you're a developer, find a project and get contributing, if you aren't
</I>&gt;<i> then there are still other ways to help in the mission, see the
</I>&gt;<i> relatively new communications team for example:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://xmpp.org/xsf/teams/communication/">http://xmpp.org/xsf/teams/communication/</A>
</I>
Yep, there is always plenty to do -- specs, howtos, translations,
support, bug reports, code patches, you name it.
