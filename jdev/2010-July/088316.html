Ah, yes. Google have an undocumented extension for buffering up  
presence until there's something else to send. I, too, have been  
thinking along these lines. It's vastly simpler to do (in both client  
and server) than SIFT. I've done a bit of looking into this, and it  
appears to save battery substantially.

</I>&gt;<i> grab bagging various XEPs and trying them out. Once there was an

</I>
 From a mobile client implementor's perspective yes.

 From a protocol designer's perspective, it's horrible - a Big Switch  
is very hard to specify, and often ends up including the kitchen sink.

This in turn means it's a nightmare for server implementors.

I'd be interested in seeing a mobile XMPP specification which - like  
the Lemonade one for email - simply points to a handful of  
specifications and how to use them effectively, as well as providing  
useful background. I have some of this written already, so I'll  
submit it as-is, and work on improving it.

Dave.
