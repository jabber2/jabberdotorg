I think this could be summarised as: some of the older projects are
not the new kids any more - they're either reaching maturity or being
abandoned, while other new kids are showing up, and some older
projects are keeping going consistently.

Openfire is less active than it used to be - but Prosody has appeared
as the new and trendy Free server - and I should probably plug M-Link
here too!
Psi is less active than it used to be - but it's not dead (it's always
gone through phases), and two of the devs went off to write a new
client, Swift, and this is new and (for me) exciting.
I don't know the state of the PyTransports for sure - I'd heard
they're static now - but Spectrum is new and active in the transports
sphere.

If one looks at XMPP as a whole, and not just counting the projects
that are slowing down, there's still a lot of new and exciting $STUFF
going on.
