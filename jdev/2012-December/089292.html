We are trying to have a component to 'set' the presence of a user in
XMPP. This solves the &quot;transport&quot; scenario were a user on for example
his phone or other client changes presence or status and this value
should be propagated. In this specific case we want to set the status.

Since there is a 'friend view' of the status and an 'admin view' we
would like to go beyond the simple presence scheme. Currently it is not
possible for a component to impersonate a user. Obviously in ejabberd
you could set service_check_from to fake the from address, but sending
an undirected presence isn't propagated by the server. (Something I try
to patch up now).
