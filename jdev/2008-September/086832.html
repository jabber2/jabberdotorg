<PRE>Hello World,
A couple of years ago I started writing an XMPP daemon in Ruby. Long story
short, I stopped working on it. Well, I've started again.

Going through the new drafts, I was making some changes and implementing
SASL PLAIN. I got that working, then decided to test it with something other
than Gajim.

That didn't go so well. First off, Ruby's REXML library doesn't like that
Psi &quot;re&quot;defines xmlns:xml in the opening stream. Also, it fails on SASL
DIGEST-MD5. The first challenge reponse is wrong. This isn't my fault,
because it works with Gajim and Digsby. It's not Psi's fault, because Psi
obviously works fine with other servers. I can't figure out what's going on
here.

When I switch to offering &quot;PLAIN&quot; alone, Gajim and Digsby work, and Psi
works unless I do what the new draft says, which is &lt;success
blah&gt;=&lt;/success&gt;. Psi rejects that, and none of the others care, so for now
I just have it with &lt;success blah/&gt;.

So all of them work on PLAIN, and everything but Psi work with DIGEST-MD5.

Anyone have any clues?
