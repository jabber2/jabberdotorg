&gt;<i> Right - you're not going to lose stanzas from the middle of a stream,
</I>&gt;<i> or have stanzas arrive out of order (when working with compliant
</I>&gt;<i> implementations, at least), but you may lose messages if the stream
</I>&gt;<i> goes down (I don't know of any implementation that monitors the TCP
</I>&gt;<i> stack and recovers stanzas that don't get acked at that layer).
</I>
So if I use a Jabber client library, the library is not required
to return an error to the caller code that it failed to deliver a
stanza (I assume that's what an XMPP message is called?). And
similarly, when a stanza is relayed between two jabber servers,
or is sent back from a jabber server, the server does not guarantee
the delivery of a stanza and is not required to retry. Correct?

If this is the case, what's &lt;message /&gt; typically used for?
Multi-media data like UDP?

BTW, what's the recommended way of sending binary data in XMPP?
BASE64 encoded?

Thanks
