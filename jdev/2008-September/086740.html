<PRE>Hello Klaeg,

For the first step you can use the service discovery (XEP-0030) and the
multi-user chat (XEP-0045).
Further on we suggest to use our multi-user gaming proposal [1] but this 
is still in development. This approach needs a server implementation for
the multi-user chat as well as for the game.  I'm currently working on a 
server plugin for openfire and would offer to support your efforts. 

It's also possible to integrate a small chat and gameserver in your game 
client implementation.

&gt;<i> I must admit that, even if Jabber seems promising, I'm a little bit lost in 
</I>&gt;<i> all the specifications and I don't know how to start implementing. I had a 
</I>&gt;<i> look to the recent thread (january and june) about the proposed Games XEPs and 
</I>&gt;<i> it seems promising for me. 
</I>
As aforementioned I think to look for XEP-0030 and XEP-0045 would be a
good start.

&gt;<i> I will also contact the thelepathy and kopete teams as there are more related 
</I>&gt;<i> to KDE, but I'd like to have your opinion and advices about my ideas. I could 
</I>&gt;<i> describe them with more details, but I'm very not at ease with the underlying 
</I>&gt;<i> concepts and I don't want to say right now too silly things :-)
</I>
We are interested in your thoughts and maybe upcoming problems.

Best regards

Guenther
