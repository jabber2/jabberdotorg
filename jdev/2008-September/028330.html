I understand why somebody might want to receive messages only from
people in their roster and/or authorized to see their presence. What I
do not understand, why the subscription must be mutual &#8210; it would make
sense to allow receiving from someone who does not have me in his roster
but I authorized him to see me (he does not need to see me to talk to
me).

Another point about google that bothers me they just decided for all
their millions of users and do not allow them to turn this off.

Have a nice day
