<PRE>First I want to thank those of you who helped us get yammer (formerly  
known as workfeed) launched.   We received so much help from the  
community and we couldn't have done it without you.      We had  
planned to launch with message push to the browser via BOSH, but were  
unable to have a fully production ready implementation by launch day  
despite all the work we put into it.    Now, I really want to get BOSH  
live and clean up our IM services but have also had trouble finding  
the time to dedicate to it.

I'm hoping there's someone out there who might want to help us finish  
what we started.     We're looking for the right person with the right  
skills either full-time or contract, on-site or off.   We are doing  
some really exciting things here at a scale that is still somewhat  
rare for BOSH/XMPP.   We're also big on open sourcing a lot of the  
work we do and have already open sourced our jabber component  
framework, even though it needs work.   Which is part of what we need  
help on.

So without belaboring the point, if you or someone you know is  
qualified and wants to help us work on some pretty awesome stuff,  
please drop me a line.
