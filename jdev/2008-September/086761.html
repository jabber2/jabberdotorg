Message receipts (XEP-0184) probably give you what you want, then.

</I>
We store undelivered messages if the user is offline, and have since 
1999. If something less expected happens (TCP outage or whatever), the 
message can be lost. See XEP-0198 for relief there (but recognize that 
it is unfinished  and unimplemented).

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Requests will be a few KBytes, replies a few KBytes to a few hundred

</I>&gt;<i> Would 64KB chunks a reasonable thing to do?
</I>
Just as one data point, the jabber.org IM service (of which I'm an 
admin) outright rejects all stanzas larger than 64k. If you send a large 
number of 63k chunks, it is very likely you will run into rate limits 
(a.k.a. &quot;karma&quot;). To repeat, XMPP is *not* optimized for sending lots of 
64k data chunks -- it's basically optimized for sending lots of chunks 
1k or smaller.
