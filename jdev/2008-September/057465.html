<PRE>Hello Guenther,

Thanks a lot for your answer. After reading some XEP (the two you pointed me 
too and you mug xep proposal), experimenting localy with ejaberd and looking 
of the kopete jabber plugin code, things are becoming clearer for me and I 
think I will be able to implement my first step. Once it is done, I'll come 
back to you to be able to exploit your openfire plugin as you proposed. I 
think that at this moment I will be able to use it effectively.

Thanks again.

Best regards,

Ga&#235;l

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; New to this list, I'm the author of KsirK, a KDE strategy game. Currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its net game uses pure TCP/IP. One player start its game by setting a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; port on which to listen to and the others connect to this port. Then the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libkdegames/kgame library is used to communicate. This lib as all what is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary to exchange messages including Qt objects. It also have a chat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; framework. KsirK is a multiplayer game with, currently, does not allow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; passive not playing participants.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber seems to be a largely better solution. I want to have a very few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; centralized system, keeping one client as the game server and using the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication framework only for that: a communication tool. I'm also not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested in controling cheating, basing the game in trust.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, my idea is to progressively switch to Jabber. In a first step, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would just allow to publish a proposed game in a kind of chat room and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then the current communication system would be used. In a second step,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; xmpp would also be used to exchange game data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the first step you can use the service discovery (XEP-0030) and the
</I>&gt;<i> multi-user chat (XEP-0045).
</I>&gt;<i> Further on we suggest to use our multi-user gaming proposal [1] but this
</I>&gt;<i> is still in development. This approach needs a server implementation for
</I>&gt;<i> the multi-user chat as well as for the game.  I'm currently working on a
</I>&gt;<i> server plugin for openfire and would offer to support your efforts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's also possible to integrate a small chat and gameserver in your game
</I>&gt;<i> client implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I must admit that, even if Jabber seems promising, I'm a little bit lost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in all the specifications and I don't know how to start implementing. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had a look to the recent thread (january and june) about the proposed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Games XEPs and it seems promising for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As aforementioned I think to look for XEP-0030 and XEP-0045 would be a
</I>&gt;<i> good start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will also contact the thelepathy and kopete teams as there are more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; related to KDE, but I'd like to have your opinion and advices about my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ideas. I could describe them with more details, but I'm very not at ease
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the underlying concepts and I don't want to say right now too silly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are interested in your thoughts and maybe upcoming problems.
