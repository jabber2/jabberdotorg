<PRE>it seems to work only if the entity behind the firewall initiate the
connection first (in this case, the client running within the mobile phone).

Please correct me if I got all this wrong as I am new to XMPP, but I would
greately appreciate if anyone can explain how the xmpp server finds the
mobile client that is on the move. Does our sever needs to implement that
routing logic ourselves? Any articles explaining this would also be great!

Thank you!

Hi,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can we use XMPP to talk to a client on a mobile device (e.g. PDA=
/ mobile phone) that is connected to the internet using 3G? From what I und=
erstand, phones&amp;#39; end-point IP changes as they move around, and generall=
y they are behind the network operator&amp;#39;s (At&amp;amp;T, Vodafone etc) firew=
all. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Say that user &amp;#39;A&amp;#39; sends a message to our mobile client. From wh=
at I understand, the message will go through the  XMPP server (e.g. Jabber.=
org or our own) to find where our client is, so it can route the message. H=
ow would the XMPP server know where to find our client in the place? The IP=
 our client used when registering with the server could be different now be=
cause it could have moved around.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Does the mobile client need to periodically notify the server about its=
 IP? From what I understand, the BOSH technique described in &lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=
<A HREF="p://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html#intro&quot;">p://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html#intro&quot;</A>&gt;<A HREF="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep=">http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep=</A>
-0124.html#intro&lt;/a&gt; is meant to address this, but it seems to work only if=
 the entity behind the firewall initiate the connection first (in this case=
, the client running within the mobile phone).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Please correct me if I got all this wrong as I am new to XMPP, but I wo=
uld greately appreciate if anyone can explain how the xmpp server finds the=
 mobile client that is on the move. Does our sever needs to implement that =
routing logic ourselves? Any articles explaining this would also be great!&lt;=
br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Thank you!&lt;br&gt;Thira&lt;br&gt;
