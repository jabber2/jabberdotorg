<PRE>As one of the few marketing folks here on this list, I'll interject my 2
cents which I very rarely do, and say based on the official press release
by Cisco corporate....I would not put a bet on &quot; In the end, perhaps
&quot;Jabber&quot; will mean nothing at all.&quot; in the future...

Note not once are the characters XMPP typed together in the release of
Jabber, Inc. acquisition..do you think that was by design, or by accident?

SAN JOSE, Calif. - Sept. 19, 2008 - Cisco today announced its intent to
acquire privately held Jabber, Inc., a provider of presence and messaging
software. Based in Denver, Jabber will work with Cisco to enhance the
existing presence and messaging functions of Cisco's Collaboration
portfolio.

The acquisition will enable Cisco to embed presence and messaging services
&quot;in the network&quot; and provide rich aggregation capabilities to users through
both on-premise and on-demand solutions, across multiple platforms including
Cisco WebEx(R) Connect and Cisco Unified Communications.

&quot;Enterprise organizations want an extensible presence and messaging platform
that can integrate with business process applications and easily adapt to
their changing needs,&quot; said Doug Dennerline, Cisco senior vice president,
Collaboration Software Group. &quot;With the acquisition of Jabber, we will be
able to extend the reach of our current instant messaging service and expand
the capabilities of our collaboration platform. Our intention is to be the
interoperability benchmark in the collaboration space.&quot;

Jabber provides a carrier-grade, best-in-class presence and messaging
platform. Jabber's technology leverages open standards to provide a highly
scalable architecture that supports the aggregation of presence information
across different devices, users and applications. The technology also
enables collaboration across many different presence systems such as
Microsoft Office Communications Server, IBM Sametime, AOL AIM, Google and
Yahoo!. Jabber's platform leads the market in system robustness,
scalability, extensibility and global distribution.

The Jabber acquisition exemplifies Cisco's &quot;build, buy and partner&quot;
innovation strategy to move quickly into new markets and capture key market
transitions. In addition to internal software innovations, Cisco actively
employs investments in, and acquisitions of, other companies to support its
software strategy; recent purchases include industry leaders WebEx,
IronPort, Securent and PostPath.

The transaction will be accounted for in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Financial terms of the transaction are undisclosed.
The acquisition is subject to various standard closing conditions and is
expected to be complete in Cisco's first half of fiscal year 2009. Upon
completion of the acquisition, Jabber employees will become part of the
Cisco Collaboration Software Group (CSG). CSG is part of the recently
established Software Group, consisting of Cisco's major software businesses;
including the IOS network operating system, network and service management,
Unified Communications solutions, policy management, and SaaS offerings.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perhaps &quot;Jabber&quot; will mean nothing at all. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong: &quot;Jabber&quot; is listed in the dictionary; &quot;XMPP&quot; is not listed (yet ;-)
