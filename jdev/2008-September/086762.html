OK. So most IM users don't care very much. We're talking about human 
communication, not app-to-app data transfer of the kind that this JLIST 
person seems to be envisioning.

&gt;<i> To put it another way, most IM users wouldn't realise messages can 
</I>&gt;<i> actually be lost, because it happens sufficiently rarely, especially 
</I>&gt;<i> compared with how many messages get ignored.
</I>
Fine. :)

&gt;&gt;<i> And how do you define &quot;guaranteed delivery&quot;? At least once? At most 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> once? Delivery with receipt? Delivery with receipt per-hop? Delivery 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with cryptographically signed receipts?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> See also XEP-0184 if you really care about this (message receipts).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tsk. That won't guarantee delivery. 
</I>
Tsk whatever. He didn't define what he meant by guaranteed delivery so I 
speculated. To my mind, saying you want &quot;guaranteed delivery&quot; is like 
saying you want &quot;security&quot;.

&gt;<i> You need that *and* XEP-0198 on 
</I>&gt;<i> every hop. 
</I>
Yes I need to update XEP-0198, I see.

&gt;<i> And, of course, you need to be able to reconnect if your 
</I>&gt;<i> network connection does go down.
</I>
Quickly, or just reconnect?

&gt;<i> Or, you could simply use a perfectly reliable network.
</I>
Oh yeah, I forgot about that option. :P
