<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Requests will be a few KBytes, replies a few KBytes to a few hundred
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; KBytes typically. For larger replies, I suppose I can chunk them up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm. XMPP is not optimized for sending around 100k+ messages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would 64KB chunks a reasonable thing to do?
</I>
That's probably still too high.  There is currently no specified maximum size 
for XMPP stanzas, but individual implementations may enforce different 
values.  The original jabberd 1.0 server had around a 10KB maximum.  The 
general consensus is that stanzas should be &quot;small&quot;, and this is largely in 
part because large stanzas block transmission of other stanzas (you cannot 
send many stanzas in parallel over one stream).

Any XMPP-based protocol which might need to transmit large datasets should 
have a mechanism for chunking or paging.  See XEP-47 or XEP-59 as building 
blocks.
