Well, I did not find that. Thanks.

I personally think that if a person wants
to connect to a chatroom, it's not very easy to understand that you have
to discover a server first. You just want to connect to the URI.

Otherwise I was impressed with the way Coccinella presented service
discovery in the server. In other clients, it's hidden and very  
advanced,
in Coccinella it's there all the time and available easily. That's  
good work
that I believe others could be inspired from.

I also discovered that Adium supports service discovery, but it's very
hidden. You place your mouse over &quot;disconnect service&quot; in the
menus and you'll get the service discovery menus. Adium actually
supports forms, even though the layout can be improved. But
the place in the menu system must be a mistake or an accident. ;-)
