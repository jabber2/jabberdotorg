Please see the subject of this thread: &quot;Communicate between two client 
instances of the same ID&quot;. I assume that &quot;JLIST&quot; wants to build some 
kind of data sharing application that enables you to exchange data with 
another device that you control. Since you control both ends, I further 
  assume that you know the other side also supports XEP-0184 and that 
you don't consider receipts optional at all. In that contexts, XEP-0184 
may yield the desired result. But only &quot;JLIST&quot; can decide for sure.
