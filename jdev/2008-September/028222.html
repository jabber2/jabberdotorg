&gt;<i> Guillaume, Alban,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The telepathy solution seems quite fine, at least with an &quot;invitation
</I>&gt;<i> use case&quot;. But for KsirK I think more to a solution where games
</I>&gt;<i> (wanting to run the game or connect to a waiting one) connect to a
</I>&gt;<i> room (viewed as a whiteboard) and discuss there to find their peers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think that telepathy can be used in such a way ?
</I>
Yes: you can offer a stream tube either to a specific contact, or to a
chatroom. When a tube is offered to the chatroom, every member of the
chatroom receives the offer (it uses the presence stanza). The tube can
be accepted and then used by several member of the chatroom.

player 1:
       unix socket
KsirK &lt;============     Telepathy       &lt;------\
                    Connection Manager         |
                            ^                  |
player 2:                   | (through the     | (through the
       unix socket          |   chatroom)      |  chatroom)
KsirK ------------&gt;     Telepathy              |
                    Connection Manager         |
player 3:                                      |
       unix socket                             |
KsirK -------------------------------&gt;     Telepathy
                                       Connection Manager

The player 1 offer a stream tube on the chatroom. All members receive
the offer. The player 2 and 3 accepts the tube. At this moment,
connections made by players 2 and 3's KsirK to the Connection Manager
will be relayed to player 1's KsirK.

A chatroom can host several tubes and of course text messages can
still be sent on the chatroom. There is only one tube per game on the
chatroom. A stream tube can have several streams. In the previous
example, there is 1 stream tube containing 1 stream between player 1 and
player 2, and another stream between player 1 and player 3.

If the protocol of KsirK was not based on TCP/IP but based on D-Bus,
you could use D-Bus tubes on a chatroom. In this case, Telepathy routes
the D-Bus messages between contacts' applications in a private session
as dbus-daemon does between applications on a single desktop:

      |                     |                     | XMPP     
      |                     |                     |

      | D-Bus conn.         | D-Bus conn.         | D-Bus conn.   
      |                     |                     |               
    KsirK                 KsirK                 KsirK             
    :1.0                  :1.1                  :1.2

   player 1              player 2              player 3

Telepathy tubes (stream or D-Bus) on a chatroom can be used on any
chatroom: it does not require the chatroom server to have any knowledge
of Telepathy or the game. Telepathy tubes on a chatroom just use normal
messages and presence stanza.

&gt;<i> In fact, I have finished implementing a first Jabber only version
</I>&gt;<i> doing the first step as described in my initial mail. I will now
</I>&gt;<i> start to work on the second step and if telepathy is really a
</I>&gt;<i> possibility I'll look to it in more details.
</I>
Maybe it is possible to have different backends: Telepathy and the
Multi-User Gaming XEP? Abiword has a plugin for collaborative editing
(Abicollab) and this plugin has a backend for XMPP and another backend
that uses Telepathy.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The advantages would be that your users do not need to setup the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; jabber (server name, password) in your game because it reuses the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; connection of the desktop. And that you keep your current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; protocol, the Telepathy framework will be responsible to reach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the contact, avoid NAT problems, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Furthermore, the Telepathy framework provides a much deeper desktop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; integration. For example, your contact can receive a notification
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Alice wants to play foo game with you. &lt;accept&gt; &lt;decline&gt;&quot; and if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; he accepts the game is automatically launched and connected to you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; See

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;ough-tubes for a similar demo using Gtetrinet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Last but not least, by using the Telepathy framework you are not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol specific. Tubes are currently implemented in our XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Gabble) and XMPP link-local (Salut) backends but we could imagine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an implementation using, say, MSN. You won't have to change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything and your application will gain new protocol support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automagically when a new backend gains tubes support.
