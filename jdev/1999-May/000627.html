<PRE>&gt;<i> 	Silly question, but why do we not support as &lt;logout&gt; tag to go
</I>&gt;<i> with the &lt;login&gt; tag?  PERSONALLY I can see no reason to do this, but if
</I>&gt;<i> a user has multiple ID's for some reason, it'd make sense..  Here's an
</I>&gt;<i> example of what I could think: 
</I>
Actually, it does support the &lt;logout/&gt; tag, looks like I just forgot to
put it in the multi-client protocol example.

&gt;<i> 	A client supports multiple ID's to connect.  Let's say you have an ISP that decides to try out Jabber for online Technical Support.
</I>&gt;<i> The techshave their own personal ID's, as well as an id such as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">DirtyOldMan at jabber.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">support at jabber.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Currenly, the client would need to end the transaction via &lt;/jabber&gt;, reconnect, and re-login.  Why not allow a &lt;/logout&gt; as well..
</I>&gt;<i> This could also be good if people want to be 'away' from their computer, but allowing the connection to remain up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	And, while we're at it, how's about being about to login as multiple users via multiple &lt;login&gt;'s?
</I>
Absolutely, and you'll be happy to know that it's already supported and in
the server!  :)  (although I haven't been able to fully test it, but it
is supposed to work)

There are lots of great reasons for &quot;multi&quot; clients, yours above, proxies,
special purpose client(pager one for instance), gateways, etc... one TCP
socket and any number of users' data flowing across it.

You don't have to do anything special to tell the server that you are a
multi-client either, it will automagically assume you are after you send a
second &lt;login&gt;&lt;/login&gt; over the same connection.
