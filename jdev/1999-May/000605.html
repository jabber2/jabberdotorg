Yeah, what's with all these classes, anyway? &lt;grin&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> If you consider the nature of Jabber, it can really be summed up as the

</I>&gt;<i> *as* a medium). It doesn't really matter if it originates from disk I/O,
</I>&gt;<i> network I/O, database...you get the picture. It can all be summarized as
</I>&gt;<i> a stream of XML data. So then, a XMLstream would be a data structure
</I>&gt;<i> that contains all the methods necessary for taking a stream of XML data
</I>&gt;<i> and reconsituting into a data structure, and then if necessary, back to
</I>&gt;<i> a XML stream. It would contain the expat parser, a packet stack for
</I>&gt;<i> keeping track of packet's being assembled, and a packet queue for
</I>&gt;<i> keeping complete packets in. Additionally, it could maintain a series of
</I>&gt;<i> function pointers to callback functions so that when packets are ready,
</I>&gt;<i> the user/lib is notified and can proceed accordingly. Overall, the
</I>&gt;<i> XMLstream would be independent of where the data is coming from, it
</I>&gt;<i> would only be interested in getting the data.
</I>
This is pretty similar to the approach I've taken with the Java client.  I
have a notion of a &quot;Pipeline&quot;.  You put Jabber packets into the head of the
pipeline, and XML comes out of the other end.  By hooking up segments of
pipe, each with their own responsibility, I get very simple and flexible
handling.

A couple of examples will illustrate.  I'll show the stage name, the
downstream responsibilities and the upstream responsibilities.  The typical
pipeline for talking sockets gets constructed like this (fair warning, I
don't have the code in front of me, so I might forget a stage).
* PacketPreparer (calls &quot;willSend&quot; on packet | calls &quot;didReceive&quot; on
packet)
* PacketParser (converts packet object into mini-DOM | converts mini-DOM
into packet) [1]
* DomHandler (converts mini-DOM into byte-stream | converts byte-stream
into
mini-DOM) [2]
* SocketSender (send byte-stream | receives byte-stream)

If I want to test the input/output stages, I can replace the SocketSender
with this structure:
* PipeSplitter (sends to the &quot;output&quot; pipe | receives from the &quot;input&quot;
pipe)
[3]
* output: OutputStreamSender (sends byte-stream to an OutputStream (like
System.out) | exception!)
* input: InputStreamReceiver (exception! | receives byte-stream from an
InputStream (like System.in))

[1] The mini-DOM is a simple implementation of the Element and Attribute
objects from the W3C's DOM.  As was recently noted in this list, the whole
thing is way overkill.
[2] This is where the XML parser comes into play.  You can see how easy it
would be to support other protocols.
[3] The &quot;output&quot; and &quot;input&quot; stages are both connected to the PipeSplitter.
Imagine a Y connection in a pipeline.)

Within the client itself, there is no awareness of XML.  It just uses
&quot;Packet&quot; objects that represent the possible communications.  I've taken
pains to make most of this framework generic.  Supporting other streaming,
packetized protocols should be relatively simple, just a matter of
providing
different packet classes and pipeline stages.

Cheers,
-Mike
