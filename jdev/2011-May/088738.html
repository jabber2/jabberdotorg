Subject: [icom] 30-day Public Review for Integrated Collaboration Object
Model for Interoperable Collaboration Services Version 1.0, Committee
Specification Draft 01

The OASIS Integrated Collaboration Object Model for Interoperable
Collaboration Services (ICOM) TC [1] members have recently approved a
Committee Specification Draft (CSD) and submitted this specification for
30-day public review:

     Integrated Collaboration Object Model (ICOM) for Interoperable
Collaboration Services Version 1.0
     Committee Specification Draft 01 / Public Review Draft 01
     16 March 2011

Specification Overview:
     The Integrated Collaboration Object Model (ICOM) for Interoperable
Collaboration Services standard defines a framework for integrating a broad
range of domain models for collaboration activities in an integrated and
interoperable collaboration environment. The framework is intended to enable
seamless transitions across collaboration activities. For example,
applications can aggregate conversation threads in email with other
conversations on the same topic in instant message, over the phone or via
real-time conferencing, by discussion threads in community forum, weblog or
micro blog, and activity stream of participants from all channels. ICOM
encompasses and improves on a range of models which are part of existing
standards and technologies. The framework lowers the barrier for independent
software vendors and open source communities to integrate collaboration
services and to create collaboration tools that offer seamless user
experience for diverse collaboration activities with minimal context
switching.

Public Review Period:
     The public review starts today, 19 May 2011 and ends 18 June 2011.

     This is an open invitation to comment. OASIS solicits feedback from
potential users, developers and others, whether OASIS members or not, for
the sake of improving the interoperability and quality of its technical
work.
