<PRE>&gt;<i> As far as deployment is concerned, you logon as 
</I>&gt;<i> administrator, install the service, then logoff. The service 
</I>&gt;<i> then no longer needs to be running in anyone's logon and it 
</I>&gt;<i> will magically fire back up whenever the system is rebooted. 
</I>&gt;<i> Ya, you have to force an account that it will logon to when 
</I>&gt;<i> it starts up. It's a service. This is how they work in 
</I>&gt;<i> windows land. If microsoft can get the bloated pig monster 
</I>&gt;<i> that is IIS running as a service then I think something like 
</I>&gt;<i> jabberd should be pretty straight forward. The jabber server 
</I>&gt;<i> should run as a service under windows. Period.
</I>
&gt;<i>From what I remember, Windows services require the app/service to
</I>implement a special API.  So unless JabberD's windows build does this,
it will either require the additional code, or a wrapper program.

&gt;<i> &gt;From the development standpoint: Since the server is is pretty much a
</I>&gt;<i> console application turning it into a bona fide service 
</I>&gt;<i> should be a cakewalk.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How all this fits into the cygwin library, however, is a 
</I>&gt;<i> mystery that I will probably be messing around with shorty.
</I>
Cygwin probably provides a nice path, but certainly not the only
approach.

Thanks,

Mike
