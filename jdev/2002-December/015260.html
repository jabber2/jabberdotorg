No it is perfectly valid to have body content when doing a 302 
redirect, usually the default apache 302 redirects contain a body which 
displays a message such as &quot;This page is now located at ...&quot; to support 
very old browsers that dont know about 302 redirects and gives the user 
the information they need to get to where they are wanting to go.

&gt;<i> Does jabberstudio contain any links to directories that are missing

I dont understand what you are trying to get at here? Default apache 
behaviors have nothing to do with PHP.
