<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; No it is perfectly valid to have body content when doing a 302 redirect,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usually the default apache 302 redirects contain a body which displays a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message such as &quot;This page is now located at ...&quot; to support very old
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsers that dont know about 302 redirects and gives the user the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information they need to get to where they are wanting to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would stand to reason that those same &quot;very old browsers&quot; would not
</I>&gt;<i> know what to do with gziped data - so if the idea is to be portable,
</I>&gt;<i> then the data following a 302 should not be gzipped.  Of course, IE6
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to figure this out...
</I>
Very old browsers would not get it gzip'd anyway since they are not sending
headers saying they support it.
Should doesnt mean it is (since when did you hear of bugfree microsoft
software), I would suggest turning off gzip and see if it fixes it.

&gt;<i> &gt; I dont understand what you are trying to get at here? Default apache
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behaviors have nothing to do with PHP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True, but the design of one influences the design of the other.  Missing
</I>&gt;<i> the trailing slashes with Apache is a know problem, which only becomes
</I>&gt;<i> evident if your apache hostname differs from your actual DNS hostname.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise the redirects happen &quot;silently&quot; and most people never know the
</I>&gt;<i> difference.  My point was that something similar could be happening in
</I>&gt;<i> PHP as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be tempted to look for 302's in the server logs, might give a clue.
</I>
I still dont understand what you are on about here, these silent apache
redirects have nothing to do with PHP since they happen at a higher level in
the server before PHP will even be executed.
