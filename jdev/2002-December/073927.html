I guess I'm nitpicking, but it would appear to be more accurate that you
would like _something visible_ to happen with the codebase.  Just
because an update hasn't been made in months doesn't mean the project is
dead.  Perhaps there's just been nothing to release?  Or, perhaps you're
not looking at the official site for the project (see below).

&gt;<i> When particulary looking at pJab (private Jabber, not perl Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> Client), i noticed that the Project was created one month ago and:

</I>&gt;<i>  - the Files Section is empty

</I>
Well, lets take a look at another project listed there:

centericq -
- project was created a bit over a month ago
- no files
- no cvs
- bugs section is empty
- tasks section is empty

By the above criteria centericq would be considered a dead project.
However, I'm sure the developer(s) and user(s) wouldn't agree.

The official web site would appear to be:
   <A HREF="http://konst.org.ua/centericq/">http://konst.org.ua/centericq/</A>


&gt;<i> I brought this up on this Mailinglist because i hoped that People
</I>&gt;<i> actually cared and discussed further what can be done better.
</I>
I do actually care, would not have responded if I didn't.  The problem
is this is an entirely subjective item.
