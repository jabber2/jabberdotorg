<PRE>Hi all,

Firstly thanks for killing that recursive email problem with AMAR..

Got a question here about Jabber/Java and JabberBeans..

I'm at the final stage of implementing my client, all the jabber 
elements are done (phew..!)

What the client is about; a shared text editor with chat facilities.

The editor along with the chat window all use the Jabber Protocol 
(naturally).

I'm having difficulties in finding a way to send DocumentEvents across 
to the other client (originally I started with KeyEvents but fell short 
on that idea),  mainly because DocumentEvents are an interface and 
can't be serialized!!

Anyway, since I'm not incredibly knowledgeable with Jabber - once I get 
the Event info I need how can I send them as an attachment/extension to 
a &lt;message&gt;  packet?

And if anyone has any ideas about the Events problem please let me know 
:<i>)  , I've got a feeling I might need some additional libraries for 
</I>this - I don't see how I can add stuff using the JabberBeans library?

Thanks


Adrian
