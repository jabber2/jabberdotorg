Excuse my wrong expression of what i was trying to say, iam neither
native nor fluent english speaker.

My Aim of the Expression &quot;will be done&quot; was not, that it will be
finished - Programs are never finished.

My aim was rather, that it should get into an usable state, or from my
point of view, that _something_ happens on the codebase within a certain
amount of time.

When particulary looking at pJab (private Jabber, not perl Jabber
Client), i noticed that the Project was created one month ago and:
 - the CVS is empty
 - the Files Section is empty
 - the TODO Section is empty
 - the the Bugs Section is empty
 ...
This leads me to the Conclusion that the Guy who added that Project is
not interested in it anymore - i might be wrong tho.


However, iam also happy with suggestions made by other Posters, i do not
expect my suggestions to be final or THAT Solution which solves
everything.

I brought this up on this Mailinglist because i hoped that People
actually cared and discussed further what can be done better.
