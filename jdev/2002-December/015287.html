There should be a tool included with cygwin which provides this. I believe
the reason this code is not a service already is that it is not in any way
recommended for deployment - it exists in its current form for easier
development on a Windows platform.
&lt;/quote&gt;

This statement confuses me to no end.

As far as deployment is concerned, you logon as administrator, install the
service, then logoff. The service then no longer needs to be running in
anyone's logon and it will magically fire back up whenever the system is
rebooted. Ya, you have to force an account that it will logon to when it
starts up. It's a service. This is how they work in windows land. If
microsoft can get the bloated pig monster that is IIS running as a service
then I think something like jabberd should be pretty straight forward. The
jabber server should run as a service under windows. Period.

&gt;<i>From the development standpoint: Since the server is is pretty much a
</I>console application turning it into a bona fide service should be a
cakewalk.

How all this fits into the cygwin library, however, is a mystery that I will
probably be messing around with shorty.
