<PRE>Some other things you might want to consider how to implement:

* Paging: MSN supports sending a special type of message to a users mobile 
device if they have one with the PAG command.

* Removing Users: If the jabber user removes and MSN user from their roster, 
should be be removed from the MSN list as well? Maybe only if there is a 
&lt;remove/&gt; and otherwise no.

* Screen Names: How are you going to implement screen names? Will it be their 
vCard nick? Will it be in their status? How will the jabber user change their 
screen name? I know this probably doesn't seem important to you, but a lot of 
people are not going to like not being able to change their screen name or 
see others.

* Message Style: The current msn-t does some interpretation of the MSN  
X-MMS-IM-Format and translates it into XHTML-basic, and I think tries to do 
it the other way around. Are you going to implement anything like this? 
Again, it may not seem important, but some people will definitely think so.

* Special Charsets: I don't know much about how this works, but MSN messages 
have a CS= key for defining a charset for a message (like Chinese or Greek) 
and I'm pretty sure Jabber just does it all UTF-8. Will there have to be some 
kind of conversion?

* Special Invitations: I know some Jabber clients now support inviting users 
to NetMeeting, and MSN does as well. Maybe you could look at the NetMeeting 
requests being sent from/to jabber clients and try to implement it.

Just some thoughts,
 - MikeM
