<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Urm from reading it it appears to have a lot to do with wireless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> village since it says &quot;Wireless Village-based Instant Messaging&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> quote:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Examples of coming features include Digital Rights Management,
</I>&gt;<i> Wireless Village-based Instant Messaging and Terminal Management.&quot;
</I>
And... It is stating the fact here again that their instant messaging 
will most likely be based on WV.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More intresting (cause it actually excists) is the Wireless Village
</I>&gt;<i> J2ME API, but so far none of the manufactorers have chosen to include
</I>&gt;<i> it in with their J2ME stacks, including Nokia.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note your &quot;apperently&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Series 60 is a *very* open platform, one could easily add a Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> messenger instead of a wireless village messenger.
</I>
It might be open and one might be able to add jabber easily but the 
fact remains that they are promoting the use of specifically wireless 
village not jabber, and there is no generic mention of instant 
messaging everywhere it seems to be coupled with wireless village.

&gt;<i> Let's look at the Nokia series 60 devices that are outthere (the 7650)
</I>&gt;<i> and the ones that have been officially announced. Can you see one with
</I>&gt;<i> wireless village? In fact can you find *any* phone that has it?
</I>
Yes UK mobiles that are setup with vodafone live, Vodafone Messenger 
appears to be a version of iFollow Messenger that its maker says 
supports Wireless Village also it says on the wireless village site 
that the iFollow server supports wireless village protocols. Now since 
vodafone appears to be deploying vodafone live to all of their 
subsidiaries I would classify that as a significant deployment. Also 
there is the fact that Vodafone is one of the worlds biggest mobile 
companies.

&gt;<i> There have been some technical implementations, but has anyone actually
</I>&gt;<i> commited to a roll-out? Don't hold your breath for too long..
</I>
Urm seemingly yes see above.

&gt;<i> I don't think WV will not be used at all. But it's definatly not the
</I>&gt;<i> standard. Just that Nokia has a few product out doesn't meant it will
</I>&gt;<i> become the standard either. It's a whole new telecom world outthere,
</I>&gt;<i> and all the platforms are *open*, and Symbian/Series 60 is the most
</I>&gt;<i> open of them all. This means *those who provide the content and promote
</I>&gt;<i> it to the user are completly free in their choice of technology*. This
</I>&gt;<i> can be an operator (most likely), or another content provider (less
</I>&gt;<i> likely), or even a manufactorer (rare, and surthenly not Nokia!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not saying WV won't be used, I'm not saying interoperatability is
</I>&gt;<i> bad (though I wonder who wants to implement this, since it has no
</I>&gt;<i> userbase at all!). I'm just saying that the conclusion that WV is going
</I>&gt;<i> to be the standard just cause there's some series 60 software is
</I>&gt;<i> *wrong*, and that overlooking the fact that WV did not reach it's
</I>&gt;<i> initial goal is a mistake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now Jabber is not just the better protocol, it's also more
</I>&gt;<i> prefered than WV by the operators so far.
</I>
Not all though Vodafone arnt (see above), so far ive only heard about 
France Telecom, Sprint and Orange going for Jabber, any other big 
mobile operators with deployments?
Im not arguing against the fact that jabber is better (i think it is), 
but the narrow view that everyone will agree and use it and that no-one 
is using wireless village and wont. We might not want to start an 
implementation of a gateway right now, but I do think we need to 
prepare for it (read up on WV, get in contact with some people there 
etc etc) as people do seem to want to use WV.
