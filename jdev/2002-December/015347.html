To this point, I propose an alternative. Jabberstudio.org seems to lead a 
similar role to sourceforge, but with a promoting focus on jabber projects. 
This means that, in the case of an GPL project or something similar, outside 
projects can look at the code and decide whether they want to help with the 
project. Next, you don't need a full fledged commercial project for it to be 
useful.

So what I propose is perhaps a new way of sorting. We currently have 
alphabetical sorting, but we should also allow users to rank projects and 
write up feedbacks and such. For example, I downloaded 5 different clients 
which didn't meet my needs until I chose one that worked. I could write a 
report describing the strong points, the weak points, features that need to 
be added if need be, a rating, and then future downloaders can look at my 
description or one of many others and, with the developers' feature list, 
they can get a picture in their heads of what each client can do. Screenshots 
for more projects would also be nice, if it doesn't effect the bandwidth 
issue. This may all sound a little over played. If that's the case, just a 
simple user rating number would be nice. Then we could hope that most people 
would speak up more and be honest about each project.

I'm not really saying anything revolutionary here, but it could help people 
choose their client of choice faster.
