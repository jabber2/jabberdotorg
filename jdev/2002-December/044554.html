It would stand to reason that those same &quot;very old browsers&quot; would not 
know what to do with gziped data - so if the idea is to be portable, 
then the data following a 302 should not be gzipped.  Of course, IE6 
should be able to figure this out...

True, but the design of one influences the design of the other.  Missing 
the trailing slashes with Apache is a know problem, which only becomes 
evident if your apache hostname differs from your actual DNS hostname.
Otherwise the redirects happen &quot;silently&quot; and most people never know the 
difference.  My point was that something similar could be happening in 
PHP as well.

I'd be tempted to look for 302's in the server logs, might give a clue.
