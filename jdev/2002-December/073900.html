<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;Series 60 Terminal Software Suite

</I>&gt;<i> This doesn't have to do much with Wireless Village, it's just a set of
</I>&gt;<i> API's that *could* be used for creating a Wireless Village messenger
</I>&gt;<i> (or a Jabber Messenger).
</I>
Urm from reading it it appears to have a lot to do with wireless village
since it says &quot;Wireless Village-based Instant Messaging&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt;So I think we need to start seriously looking at Wireless Village
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;interoperability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wireless Village is not dead. But it didn't become what many hoped it
</I>&gt;<i> would be. In fact, it's just another protocol out there. There's no
</I>&gt;<i> reason you can't use XMPP instead, or SIP/SIMPLE etc. Most of the
</I>&gt;<i> operators and manufactorers are partnering with a non-open network
</I>&gt;<i> (mostly AOL and MSN), or use Jabber or something like OpenWave.
</I>&gt;<i> Wireless Village is *not* THE &quot;default&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; way of
</I>&gt;<i> interacting with mobile devices, merely one way.
</I>
It might be just another protocol but it is what has been chosen as the
instant messaging protocol for series 60 apparently so it likely will become
the default and standard way of doing instant messaging on mobiles since it
is being supported by Nokia (the number one mobile maker), and several of
the other major mobile makers that have licenced series 60.

&gt;<i> IMHO XMPP is a much better standard then wireless village. However espc.
</I>&gt;<i>  for new JEPs people tend to be very &quot;Desktop&quot; oriented. It's important
</I>&gt;<i>  to keep bloat out or jabber and think beyond just the desktop clients.
</I>
Yes I certainly agree that XMPP/Jabber is better but Nokia seems to have
made their mind up so there is not that much that can probably be done about
that now no matter what we think, so instead of just saying effectively
&quot;ours is better and they should be using it so lets not think about it&quot; I
think we do need to think about it.

&gt;<i> As for interoperability.. that's nice to say but it's not like Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> that you can just connect to any server on the network. So even if
</I>&gt;<i> there's an operator that will use this, then there still has to be an
</I>&gt;<i> agreement to let a jabber server or all jabber servers connect. Espc.
</I>&gt;<i> if they already have a deal with eg. AOL this will not come easy.
</I>
I dont see what AOL has to do with Wireless Village? But I would expect the
Wireless Village community would welcome Jabber interoperability as it will
allow their users to communicate with a much greater audience.

&gt;<i> BTW: the Wireless Village discussion took place on SJIG, not JDEV.
</I>
Should we be moving this discussion over to standards-jig then?

Richard
