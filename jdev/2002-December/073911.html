<PRE>Thanks for all your replies - be warned that you're all now in my list
of potentially helpful people ;)

I like to ask for feature-requests as early as possible so that I can
sketch out what I've got to write.  I'm well versed in the pain caused
both by over-reaching (great results short-term, unmanageable code
long-term) and under-reaching (6 months into a project, a new feature
request might mean a complete rewrite - I'm doing this project in part
because I didn't see Unicode coming until it was too late).  My strategy
to deal with this kind of thing is to get all the suggestions in quickly
so that I can keep them in mind, but stick to a slow and steady
progression of code.

On some specific points -
<A HREF="http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/phorum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=1429&amp;t=1429">http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/phorum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=1429&amp;t=1429</A>
claims that MSN paging may only be supposed to work with the official
MSN client.  I'm not that fond of MS, but surely if that's the way they
want to fund their network, we shouldn't lightly step on that, just
because we can?

Also, on the subject of charsets - that whole area confuses me - UTF-8
can encode any character in any of the character sets mentioned on
hypothetic.org.  In particular, I know that Unicode was designed in part
to improve upon the mistakes of SHIFT-JIS.  I can only think that this
information is redundant (a hint to the GUI) or that the protocol
authors shoved &quot;charset=UTF-8&quot; into the header for decoration.  Either
of these would be a change from the surprisingly open, simple protocol
to the twisted, non-conformant MS I've heard so much about :)
Do you have any multilingual text which I could examine?

	- Andrew
