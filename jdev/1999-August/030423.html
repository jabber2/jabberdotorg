</I>&gt;<i> That being said, there is no reason that any particular client CAN'T do
</I>&gt;<i> client to client connections, it's just outside the scope of Jabber,
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber is all about the server. If a client author chooses to impliment
</I>&gt;<i> anything like client to client connections, it's something specific for
</I>&gt;<i> that client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that out of the way, the next big question/topic is File Transfers.
</I>&gt;<i> I have a proposal for File Transfers and Jabber partially written, and I
</I>&gt;<i> will finish it over the next 24-48 hours and post it.  It should answer
</I>&gt;<i> many questions and appease many developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Last thing: MIME.  It will not become part of the standard
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;message&gt;&lt;/message&gt; packet any time soon, if ever.  All of the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality that people want MIME for will be part of the File Transfer
</I>&gt;<i> feature(s) that I'll be proposing soon.
</I>
	I look forward to seeing the file transfer mechanism. That Jabber has to be
interoperable and be able to exchange files with other IM systems ( I am
glad this has been brought up again, honestly. It is all too easy to lose
focus. ) makes the topic extremely interesting.

	Jer, I suggest creating a client to client optional protocol team. If you
don't want to - it is, indeed, outside the scope of interoperable Jabber -
then those of us interested, myself included, will form an external working
group and move our discussions and ultimately implementations there.

	Also, I have some more general question regarding extensions: Message
extensions aren't required to be interoperable, right? So we can create
extensions which aren't supported by other transport systems?  Transports
may or may not deal with extensions which they feel they can handle, right?

	Any thoughts on the possibility of creating an extensions team?


Patrick
