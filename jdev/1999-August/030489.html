<PRE>I apologize, I'll leave our messages private. It's more a setting with the
weirdnesses of my mail client (this seems to be happening often) than be
trying to be impolite.

Scott.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Scott, I tried to help you reshape this idea in private, but if you want to
</I>&gt;<i> take it to the whole jdev list, that's your business. Still, it is generally
</I>&gt;<i> polite to ask permission. What I write to you in email privately I may not
</I>&gt;<i> want shared with the list or whoever. I'm likely to be more candide and less
</I>&gt;<i> formal than I would be if writing for distribution. Now, that said, I do
</I>&gt;<i> understand that whatever I write may get shown to anyone - can't help that.
</I>&gt;<i> But the burden of politeness is on you.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: RE: [JDEV] A piece of MIME?
</I>&gt;<i> Importance: High
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 	I don't want to reply to this in detail before I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; respond to Jer's documents, but you do realize you're not using MIME,
</I>&gt;<i> don't you? Have you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; read the MIME rfcs? Mangling out the type specification into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the XML makes it not only NOT MIME, but REALLY FRAGILE as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I stated, it was _very_ rough but gave an idea for what I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aiming for. It needs a _lot_ of work to become a MIME-workalike... however
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've weighed the various options on how to use MIME within Jabber and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mangling&quot; our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specification was the only way I could be slightly happy with. (I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anywhere near happy.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	The very words 'MIME-workalike' should make you stop and think about what
</I>&gt;<i> you're proposing. Remember the three Rs?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	MIMEXML might be a worthy thing. But if you're interested in that, go start
</I>&gt;<i> an IETF BOF. Why hack it up here when there's no need to? Clients will have
</I>&gt;<i> to make some kind of weird kludgey XML-MIME bridge thing, which smacks of
</I>&gt;<i> ugly. It makes it difficult to implement ANY reasonably simple client. That
</I>&gt;<i> alone should stop you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 	Please consider just putting the MIME block in the message,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not screwing with the message packet protocol itself unless where
</I>&gt;<i> neccessary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Placing a MIME block in the message is a working solution. Let me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paste in a paragraph from my essay:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Creating an extension &quot;&lt;MIME&gt;&quot; tag, while appealing, has a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem. Placing the MIME'ed text straight into the tag could potentially
</I>&gt;<i> cause conflicts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the XML. While I am probably (hopefully) wrong on this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem, I have yet to see any solutions to the problem if someone places
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;&lt;/message&gt;&quot; within their &quot;jab&quot;. This also applies to standard messages.
</I>&gt;<i> One could place a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;hack&quot; where all data is BASE64'ed or UUENCODED, but this is ugly in it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own right. Also, this would require including a entire MIME decoding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; engine when we already have an XML engine. Wouldn't it be nice to use what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we already have? Finally, the advantages of &quot;multipart&quot; and forwarding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber messages verbatim would be killed. (or at least crippled)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	And if you'd actually read in my note where I mention that Jabber is
</I>&gt;<i> already addressing this problem by using CDATA Sections, you'd know better
</I>&gt;<i> than to try this &quot;&lt;/message&gt;&quot; argument with me. What it does is indicate to
</I>&gt;<i> me that you don't bother to read an entire message before replying, which is
</I>&gt;<i> disheartening, to say the least.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Also see above where I argue that reinventing MIME would be a lousy idea.
</I>&gt;<i> SURE, you've got an XML engine right there. Great. You've also got a socket
</I>&gt;<i> library. Whee.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Kindly tell me exactly how multipart/ messages would be a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
