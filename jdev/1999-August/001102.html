<PRE>Ahh...a practical use for CTSP/CTCP transparency I was talking about :)

If entities are all treated the same (same basic Jabber protocol), it 
would be very simple for people to set up their own meta-lists with 
routing and forwarding, etc.

Hmm...abstracting this, then each client could have a set of &quot;lists&quot;, 
which would each have a list of users.  Some lists would be &quot;private&quot; 
(personal buddy list?, family list?), some could be &quot;public&quot;, like a user 
group, which was viewable and messagable by everybody.
