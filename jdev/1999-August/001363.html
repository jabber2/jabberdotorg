<PRE>Just so I don't come across sounding ignorant.. I wasn't agreeing to the
fact that the logo should go into the GUI or even that there should be a
_THE_ GUI.  But if these folks were planning on what their GUI's should look
like and where the AOL logos should be plastered, I was commenting that it
should be placed in an appropriate place.. I personally don't think that the
clients should have to have any logos.

On a seperate note, I'm not sure I like the idea of having the AOL transport
automagically create an AOL screen name for me.. Instead, I would prefer
something like the following:
1)  I have no AOL screen name
2)  I send a message to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">joeschmo at AIM</A>
3)  The Jabber server looks up my personal settings and sees I have no AOL
screen name.
4)  The Jabber server sends me a message saying that it needs to create me a
screen name and somehow or another asks me if I want to specify a
name/password or if I want to let it do it for me..
5)  I respond to the Jabber server with whichever choice I made
6)  The jabber server creates the account on AOL and adds it to my personal
settings
7)  The jabber server transmits my message..

Of course, if I already have a AOL screen name, there's got to be some way
for me to tell the Jabber server that I have one and what it is.. Something
like a setting in the client that once set transmits the info to the Jabber
server to be added to my personal settings..

I think there's just certain things that the client must be able to do..
Making it so that the server automatically does everything is just bound to
cause problems..

Once again: There is no such thing as *the* Jabber GUI.
Once again: We are unable to impose *any* demands on how clients are
	created.

It is the *server* that will interact with AOL servers. You may not even
know your own AOL UID because the account was automatically createdby the
transport. Admittedly, there might be a function in some GUIs to tell the
AOL transport your UID, but that UID would then be stored at you Home
Server and you may communicate with AOL users using an client.

I don't mean to jump at you. It's just that we are unable to enforce any
agreements with AOL. They must accept the work we do, or choose not to
work with us. To clarify: if anyone created a Jabber client containing
such stuff as is proposed above and released under GPL or similar license,
I would remove that code and logo and distribute a modified copy from my
web page to save space in the distribution package and installed binaries.

And we who listen to the sky, or walk the dusty grade,
Or break the very atoms down, to see how they are made,
Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand;
The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand.
