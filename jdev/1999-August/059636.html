<PRE>Interleaved response.

Are you meaning to send only to me?

Scott.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From: Scott Robinson [mailto:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">scott at tranzoa.com</A>]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 	As for Client to Client protocols: Jabber was originally designed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; as it is, client to server, on purpose. It may be that a client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; protocol would be a separate protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand that CTCP goes against the Jabber &quot;mission
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; statement&quot; as it is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, as has been shown in the past, people will find a use/something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that can only use CTCP... I'm suggesting we write, at least, an official
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recommendation as to how CTCP could be implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Alright, I see what you're saying. Clients *will* talk to each other
</I>&gt;<i> directly, so let's start something to support that. Fine. But let me make a
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Reduce, reuse, recycle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	That is, if you're going to transfer files, look for something that already
</I>&gt;<i> does that pretty well, and use it. If you're going to implement 1:1 chat,
</I>&gt;<i> look for something that does that well and use it. And so on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
ZModem? :) Actually, as you may have noticed from my _need_ to use
pre-existing code, I love triple-R'ing code. However, I believe in the case
of CTCP, we may need to create a new spec. I only say this because Jabber is
a XML paradigm. I know of no CTCP protocols that are based on XML. In that,
I would have a severe problem with talking to the server in XML, but
developing some CTCP protocol that isn't.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 	You've probably looked at the protocol closely enough to know that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; MIME messages go in the &lt;ext&gt; message extensions. This is itself an XML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; document fragment. Jeremie has been slow to produce a draft standard on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this, though he claims he has one on the back burner. Honestly, Jer's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; absenteeism is what's slowing down jabber.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If Jer's slowing us down (I wouldn't know one way or the other)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then we can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take it into our own hands. User-controlled and splintered FTPs and web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pages, while not the most efficient way to burn time, at least get us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working. -- I'm not experienced with XML to a level I'm happy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with, yet, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will be trying to work in many of my suggestions to a new DTD. I figure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that at least having a portable document available for developers places
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber one step closer to completion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	I did NOT say or imply that Jer slows 'us' down. Jer is what keeps jabber
</I>&gt;<i> going at all. What I did mean to say is that Jeremie could do better by
</I>&gt;<i> paying more attention to JDEV and the jabber developers. He does a lot - an
</I>&gt;<i> aweful lot - but in this explosive last few weeks, he has been playing with
</I>&gt;<i> web servers behind the scenes. That's not a bad thing! It does have to get
</I>&gt;<i> done! And he's no doubt busy besides. I'm not blaming or judging him in any
</I>&gt;<i> way; merely asserting that the jabber community needs some better
</I>&gt;<i> organization ASAP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Oh, ok. =D -- Hey Jer, how about adding some of us to your crew? We'd _love_
to help you in your administration blues!

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 	I suggest that plain vanilla messages be sent as text in the body
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of the message statement only. This will reduce traffic. The MIME
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; extension should probably remain silent on these. For other types of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; media, how about something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;ext&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  &lt;MIME&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  &lt;/MIME&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;ext&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 	Seems simple enough, what do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Seems just fine. In the case of a MIME bearing message, I would suggest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; placing in the message text body either the description of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MIME message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or a notice saying &quot;this is a MIME message and you'll need &lt;advertised
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client&gt; to read it.&quot; Probably both would be best!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	I thought I made this point pretty clear: clients should NOT encapsulate
</I>&gt;<i> messages in MIME unless ABSOLUTELY neccessary. Why is that? Because
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise, Super-Complex Client A will be unable to communicate with
</I>&gt;<i> super-simple client b. Jabber clients must be allowed to be simple. Putting
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;You can't read this! Nyah!&quot; in the message body for a text/plain MIME
</I>&gt;<i> message is sheer folly. It increases network traffic needlessly, and
</I>&gt;<i> alienates simple clients.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Remember, k.i.s.s.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Good point. Message text contains a ASCII'fied version of the MIME encoded
message. There may be duplication, but it keeps true to both standards.
Either way, I hope that in a further version of the Jabber spec we support
compression. (I would suggest adding it in about the time we get encryption
working) Compression of course killing the worry about duplication.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Krufty. ;) BTW, I don't have the address for JabberBeans. Is there anyway
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you could send it to me? I've decided I'll be implementing my own C Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; library, and modeling it after JabberBeans would make moving between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platforms for developers much easier. -- Speaking in the blind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here, I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggest adding MIME straight into the main library, only because it should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; become the &quot;standard&quot; transport and normal text messages just come to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client as a MIME message with only one text part.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Again, about MIMEing straight text: Do not do this. Put a MIME declaration
</I>&gt;<i> in the MIME extension if that tickles your fancy, but don't require clients
</I>&gt;<i> to support MIME. I like MIME as much as the next guy, and maybe every client
</I>&gt;<i> on earth will support it, but jabber's basic design principle of k.i.s.s.
</I>&gt;<i> for the client pretty much precludes requiring MIME.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	There is no address for JabberBeans. Those interested can join the
</I>&gt;<i> JabberBeans development list at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.egroups.com/groups/jabberbeans-dev/.">http://www.egroups.com/groups/jabberbeans-dev/.</A> I'll put the alpha in the
</I>&gt;<i> vault there. I'm going to create a JabberBeans announcement list and a
</I>&gt;<i> discussion list as well, because I perceive the three as separable topics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thanks!

&gt;<i> 	JabberBeans itself seems to work fine, though it is by no means finished.
</I>&gt;<i> There's no high level documentation, there is no complete working example
</I>&gt;<i> client, and the integrated test suite is not complete. There is a fair
</I>&gt;<i> amount of JavaDoc, which I've been working at pretty steadily, and that
</I>&gt;<i> should help. Its API probably won't change wildly after this, excepting
</I>&gt;<i> changes to protocol objects just as Messages or what have you that jabber
</I>&gt;<i> may amend from time to time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	As for using it as an example for building a C or C++ (you seem to prefer
</I>&gt;<i> straight C, right?) library, I don't know how much it will help you. You're
</I>&gt;<i> welcome to try. But JabberBeans is in Java, and makes full use of the object
</I>&gt;<i> oriented paradigm. Er, to overuse a phrase.
</I>
Well, with Kruft coming I'll end up coding C++, but I do prefer C. If in the
very least, I can see an example API and maybe improve/create a derivative
work.
