</I>&gt;<i> even have the distinction between different addresses?
</I>
I don't understand. If the machine isn't called icq, the current scheme
has the same problem?

&gt;<i> Also, we wouldn't have any way of knowing all the possible transports out
</I>&gt;<i> there and specifying them, there will likely be third party services that
</I>&gt;<i> put up a special closed service on their server, and this should be
</I>&gt;<i> transparent to the end user, just <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">blah at service.com.</A>
</I>
But how do the server on the receiving end differentiate addresses? It
would have to know which transport each user is using. And that would also
mean that usernames must be coordinated between transports so no ambiguity
arises. I find that a bit constricting.
 
&gt;<i> Pure and absolute transparency is one of the essential goals of Jabber,
</I>&gt;<i> there shouldn't be any way of distingushing the type of user from the
</I>&gt;<i> address.
</I>
But what if we want to handle addresses for some other messaging system
that also use mail addresses (eg email)? Heck, any system with a
distributed model will give the current scheme problem, won't it?

I'm not sure I understand your intentions. These comments are more to try
to understand than to argue my own idea.

And we who listen to the sky, or walk the dusty grade,
Or break the very atoms down, to see how they are made,
Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand;
The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand.
