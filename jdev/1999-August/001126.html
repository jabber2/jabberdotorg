  CTCP would not affect transports in the slightest..

  I look at this as an additional feature, but everyone has their favorite..

  They may not..  Personally, I would like to be able to use ICQ and AOL ID's while using Jabber, but if you notice, I'm not on those teams..  ;-P

  I think we should take the shotgun approach.. ;-P  I can't say how well the transports will be able to do file transfers, as I have simply no clue how THEY do it..  I know that I can make the Jabber&lt;=&gt;IRC transport work with any of the above, so I'm guessing that they can as well..

  Oh, and BTW, this is also client negotiation, but the TRANSPORT catches it instead of the client..
