<PRE>  Sorry, but from an architecture standpoint, this would be a very POOR example.  You are now relying on an independent client's lists, which mean you are now relying on that particular user.  This type of listing should be done by a client, with no interaction with other clients.  A transport would be better for the equivilent of this.  You're more talking about a client that acts as a transport, which is possible using the CURRENT protocol..  This is NOT a good example of peer to peer.

  I also mentioned the metaserver idea becouse it one would need to be able to find these lists easily, without needing to cross your fingers and go for a web search..

  You would also not be able to address easily in this case..  How would you address to a mailing list I own?  <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">SomeList at TwOlf.jabber.org</A> will NOT work, as I would need a DNS entry for TwOlf.jabber.org..  ;-P
