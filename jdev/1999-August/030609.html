<PRE>&gt;<i> 	The IMPP group is shunning this 'closed-door, invitation-only' antithesis
</I>&gt;<i> to the standardization process. I suggest the Jabber project do exactly the
</I>&gt;<i> same.
</I>
Actually, that was just the reaction of some on the IMPP list... the
issues were straightened out and some representatives of the IETF will be
attending as will most companies involved in the IM space.  The reason for
the initial &quot;closed-door&quot; approach by pulver.com was, as I understand it,
only to keep the press out.

&gt;<i> 	The 'summit' is merely an attention-grabbing stunt from pulver.com; they
</I>&gt;<i> have no idea how the standardization process works.
</I>
On the contrary, pulver.com is primarily interested in voice+ip, and
they've discovered that for net telephony to really be a success, it needs
an open instant messaging and status notification network in place.  So
they are hosting the summit simply to help accelerate the standardization
progress and bring everyone together to talk about the issues.

I wasn't going to say anything until I had everything 100% confirmed, but
it looks as if I will be attending the IM summit as well, and possibly
presenting Jabber to the group.  Since I live in Iowa and would not be
able to make the trip on my own, pulver.com has graciously sponsored my
travel and attendance.

I'll let everyone know any more details as I find them out, and write up a
report after the summit.  In the meantime, I'm going to try to put
together a working system for demonstration using the ICQ and AIM
prototype transports before the summit.  Fun fun FUN!
