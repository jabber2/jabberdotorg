  Becouse transports are independent.  the name foobar.server.com doesn't mean a thing, but an ICQ address COULD look like <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">UIN at foobar.server.com</A>, with fubar serving as an ICQ transport.  When I send a message to foobar.server.com, I don;t really KNOW what the transport there IS in all actuallity.  I don;t think I responded clearly, but I've got alot going on today..  :-(

  We're using a global namespace here.  That means an infinite non centralized system.  Same as email..  When you send an email to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">someone at somewhere.com</A>, you have NO IDEA what's going to happen to that mail message behind the scenes..  <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">someone at someaddress.com</A> is a standard way of saying '<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A>'.  Finger uses the exact same method.  Just becouse you can finger someone, doesn;t mean you can mail them..  (MOST of the time the email address is the same as the username, but it doesn't HAVE to be).  Perfect example..  Go ahead and try to finger <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">tcharron at my-deja.com.</A>  Betcha don't get what you'd think.. ;-P  Handling email or finger requests would happenm THRU a transport..  Aka, tcharron%<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">my-deja.com at mail.jabber.org.</A>  This is simply an example, and would probrably NOT be the best way to do it..
