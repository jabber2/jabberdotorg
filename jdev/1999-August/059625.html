<PRE>Are you guys sure you're straight on SWIG and what it's used for?  I have
actually used SWIG for a project; from what I can tell (and what I used it
for) was for developing extensions in C/C++ for mating with a scripting
language (and not the other way around, which is what you guys seem to
think it does).  For example, my application was this heinous Python
program (I love Python; I mean what it did was heinous, not Python itself
:<i>) for which I coded some C modules to interface with an existing C++
</I>toolkit.  Perhaps SWIG does the reverse (allows you to extend C with a
scripting language), but if it does, I wasn't aware of it.  (it wouldn't
make much sense, since the whole reason why SWIG was developed in the
first place was to code some compute-intensive routines in C to mate with
a big Python app on a supercomputer...)
