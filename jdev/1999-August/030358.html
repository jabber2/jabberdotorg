<PRE>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, with the way MIME plain is, you'd be forced to download the
</I>&gt;<i> whole message. However, you wouldn't be forced to look at it. Undocumented
</I>&gt;<i> MIME extensions do exist whereby they send a URL for the part, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think we should go there.
</I>
I disagree.  I think there needs to be some way to help folks who don't want
to or currently have time to download a large multimedia attachment.  Think
of a home user, running a Jabber client over a 28.8 modem connection.

I don't know whether a URL, or some other client-to-client negotiation is in
order, but I think it's something we need to address.
