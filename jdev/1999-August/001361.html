Once again: There is no such thing as *the* Jabber GUI.
Once again: We are unable to impose *any* demands on how clients are
	created.

It is the *server* that will interact with AOL servers. You may not even
know your own AOL UID because the account was automatically createdby the
transport. Admittedly, there might be a function in some GUIs to tell the
AOL transport your UID, but that UID would then be stored at you Home
Server and you may communicate with AOL users using an client.

I don't mean to jump at you. It's just that we are unable to enforce any
agreements with AOL. They must accept the work we do, or choose not to
work with us. To clarify: if anyone created a Jabber client containing
such stuff as is proposed above and released under GPL or similar license,
I would remove that code and logo and distribute a modified copy from my
web page to save space in the distribution package and installed binaries.

And we who listen to the sky, or walk the dusty grade,
Or break the very atoms down, to see how they are made,
Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand;
The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand.
