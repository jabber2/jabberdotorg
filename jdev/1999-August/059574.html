<PRE>  Please, do..  Expandibility and choice is a feature, not a bug.. ;-P

  My only concern is file attachments..

  In order to do this correctly, we need to have the negotiation system intact and working..  My main concern here is offline file storage..  The servers need to be able to refuse packets based on size.  There's a whole ball of wax here that I really haven't though about, and I'm not sure about Jer..  Here's a few things the transports AND etherx routers need to be able to do:

1) Somehow state the maximum packet size allowed..  This is a convience for clients, see below for what happens if they don't listen..

2) If a packet reaches a predefined size, disconnect, delete all data that that message EVER existed, and send a nastygram to the from addy, along with an info message to the dest user.

3) Keep track of and monitor maximum server side storage..  Aka, if an offline file get's X big, refuse all future messages for that user, with an error stating that they have exceeded their server side storage limitation.

  Without these, script kidies start sending their /boot/vmlinuz files several hundred times to a user..  'KaBloom!'.  The jabber spool directory get's to gigs, and possibly downs the server..

  For that matter, perhaps a client feature would be 'maximum possible packet size'.  If it reaches a certain peak, it prompts the user if they want to abort..  (Aka, send nasty message to server, ban user, and disconnect/reconnect)..
