Yep. I thought of the issue, but didn't find a good solution inside the
context of filters. A message obviously have to be marked somehow to
notify it's already been through a filter. For example, a redirected
message obviously need to be reinserted in the message queue somehow, but
we don't want it to be subjected to new filters. Similarly we don't want
reject replies to be targeted by normal filters (though you could perhaps
have a way to filter those as well, given special filters).

The problem is, we don't want people to be able to send messages that
trick their way past filters by saying: 'I'm a rejection reply' or 'I'm an
error message.' Thus, we need Jabbertransport to protect us from this
somehow. Any thoughts? (I feel I will be writing a new mail on the subject
of verification and auditability shortly so you may want to save your
replies for that ;)
