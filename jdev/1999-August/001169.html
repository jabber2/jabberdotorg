<PRE>&gt;<i>    Under &lt;type&gt;***&lt;/type&gt;: &#149;private &gt;&gt;Priavte&lt;&lt; only data
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Immediately before discussion: &quot;By simply changing the &lt;query&gt; to 
</I>&gt;<i> a &lt;set&gt;, the data can be updated/stored. (This would of course only 
</I>&gt;<i> be allowed by an authenticated session from the correct user 
</I>&gt;<i> account)&quot; -- It's my understanding that the grammatically correct way 
</I>&gt;<i> would be to remove the period from its current location and place it 
</I>&gt;<i> after the final parenthesis.
</I>
Corrected...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Now, to the potentially more interesting parts...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [snipped excellent discussion of discoverable queries]
</I>
This ran through my head some time ago but I forgot to include it in the
proposal... What I was thinking is that when an empty query was sent, a
reply of all of the possible fields would be returned:

&lt;info&gt;
	&lt;to&gt;jer&lt;/to&gt;
	&lt;target&gt;user&lt;/target&gt;
	&lt;type&gt;public&lt;/type&gt;
	&lt;query/&gt;
&lt;/info&gt;

Would be the &quot;discovering&quot; query, with a possible reply of:

&lt;info&gt;
	&lt;to&gt;jer&lt;/to&gt;
	&lt;target&gt;client&lt;/target&gt;
	&lt;type&gt;public&lt;/type&gt;
	&lt;result&gt;&lt;name/&gt;&lt;email/&gt;&lt;zip/&gt;&lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/info&gt;

Unless there is an issue with this, I'll add it to the proposal :)

For automated purposes though, I would still like to come to a consensus
on a standard set of queries for different purposes.  So that for instance
clients could have a special &quot;about&quot; box for the server that would show
the common variables(url, admin name/email, etc), and those simple queries
would need to be hard-written into the client.

&gt;<i> &gt; File Transfer Proposal: <A HREF="http://core.jabber.org/file.html">http://core.jabber.org/file.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Under HTTP: &quot;Why not utilize all that has been invested in 
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge and development in HTTP for file transfers with Jabber?&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> That should be &quot;of&quot; HTTP, not &quot;in&quot; HTTP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Under How?: It's not as simple as just saying &quot;Ok, we'll use 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP&quot;. -- I believe the final &quot; goes after the period. As for &quot;the 
</I>&gt;<i> URL could be placed somewhere else in the message(possibly in the ext 
</I>&gt;<i> tags?).&quot;, I think you've been programming too much -- There's 
</I>&gt;<i> normally a space before a parenthesis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Under Sending Files: The same parenthsis-w/o-space problem occurrs 
</I>&gt;<i> several times in the last paragraph.
</I>
Fixed, gracias!

&gt;<i>    Hrm I think allowing a description and address is definately a 
</I>&gt;<i> good idea. Requiring client parsing of say seems like a bad idea, as 
</I>&gt;<i> does including the URL in &lt;ext&gt; because, if I understand right, 
</I>&gt;<i> unrecognized content in &lt;ext&gt; wouldn't normally be shown to the user. 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure what's a good idea, though...
</I>
Why not use the subject field then, the &lt;sub&gt;<A HREF="http://whatever&lt;/sub">http://whatever&lt;/sub</A>&gt; would
be the &quot;subject&quot; of the message and the &lt;say&gt;&lt;/say&gt; would contain the
description.  This way with clients that don't recognize the special
message, their users can still access and cut/paste the URL.  This also
works well with transports to other IM services, who would all preserve
the subject even if they don't support the message type directly.

&gt;<i>    Though this is designed for file transfer, I think it would work 
</I>&gt;<i> fine for negotiating *any* client-client connection. You might want 
</I>&gt;<i> to call it type=ctc (client to client) or something similar though, 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than &quot;file&quot; which could be confusing to developers and cause 
</I>&gt;<i> client-writers to create their own CTCP when they don't realize that 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;file&quot; covers almost every other possible type of client-client 
</I>&gt;<i> connection, too.
</I>
Agreed.  What about type='url'?  This way any resources that can be
described via a URL (which is just about everything anymore and custom
uses can be of the format <A HREF="custom://server:port/resource">custom://server:port/resource</A>) can be sent.

&gt;<i>    I corrected the errors I saw, but didn't do a careful proof-
</I>&gt;<i> reading. As far as the ideas behind the proposals, though, they both 
</I>&gt;<i> seem quite sound and no real problems come to my mind, just the 
</I>&gt;<i> couple minor suggestions mentioned above.
</I>
Thanks!  Comments and corrections appreciated!
