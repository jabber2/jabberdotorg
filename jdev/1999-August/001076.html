<PRE>&gt;<i> Exactly.  The Jabber protocol should be the Jabber protocol.  PLEASE
</I>&gt;<i> let's NOT create a separate protocol for each client!  That's what Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> was supposed to solve, right?  I see no reason why CTCP can't be
</I>&gt;<i> identical to CTSP.  The addition is that CTSP handles event notification
</I>&gt;<i> (buddy online, etc.) while client won't.  But there is no reason to
</I>&gt;<i> create two parallel protocols.  For instance, keeping one protocol would
</I>&gt;<i> allow a client to &quot;proxy&quot; for another (for whatever reason you'd want to
</I>&gt;<i> do that).
</I>
I agree, jabber should no tbe concerned with MIME types or any of the client
oriented CTCP protocols. Isn't he porject designed as a server based XML
stream? Since this is the case, the client will all have XML parsers built
in, so why not just define a CTCP standard for attempting to initiate an XML
stream to another client - this way at least all the clients can talk to one
another and they'll be guided by a common CTCP protocol.

I really see no advantage to trying to make MIME stuff happen between
clients, that gets a little bit nuts. If we end up with email transports
that read MIME sources it should simply convert them to an XML stream as
well.

&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber client to server is an XML streaming protocol, but that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constrain the client to client. Sure, it might be nice to reuse the 'xml
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware' that the client's already got, but then again, there are other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approaches.  For instance, Jer has an example in one of his feature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; negotiation proto-proposals that indicates that *each kind* of client to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client interaction may have or use its own protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think people should be careful about getting too deep into this file
transfer and MP3 stuff. That gets a little bit crazy I think. Jabber itself
it seems should mainly be concerned with lightwieght XML streams to unify
communications. The clients should just make an MP3 plugin if they want to
that stuff, but it seems that gets outside the actual scope of Jabber
itself.

How complex of file transfers are we talking about? We don't want to get off
track and start to build a client that basically does
email/ftp/http/icq/aol/etc :)
Since this stuff will happen as various clients get created, we should
consider some XML based standard I think though.

Any news on the main site yet? :)
