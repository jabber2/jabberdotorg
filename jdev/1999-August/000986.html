<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.  Kill the standard Window menu; use something that takes up less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; space, like the ICQ button.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Not sure what you mean.
</I>
OK.  I'm looking at my Outlook Express window.  My menu bar contains seven
menu items:  File, Edit, et al.  These seven items take up only half the
width of the window, yet the Windows menu extends the entire width of the
window.  Now, for a &quot;normal&quot; app like Outlook Express, this isn't a bad
thing.  However, for an always-up messenger tool, window space is far more
precious.

As an alternative, look at the ICQ menu button or the Windows 95 &quot;Start&quot;
button.  They hide a menu and allow access via a button, saving a lot of
real estate.  I like that for small tools.

&gt;<i>    Also, it'd be nice if you could get a list of on-line users from
</I>&gt;<i> the systray in a menu-style. Like just right click on the icon in the
</I>&gt;<i> systray, go to the &quot;roster&quot; submenu or whatever and see what's there.
</I>
Hmm.... I like this.  What about, in the ubiquitous context menu you get by
right-clicking on the tray icon, one of the menu picks is a &quot;Send Message To
&gt;<i>&quot;, which expands into your buddy list?  I know I would use that a lot--my
</I>usual algorithm is &quot;Oh, I need to tell Joe about xyzzy.  Restore AIM, find
Joe, double-click on Joe, send message, close message window, minimize AIM.&quot;
This could be reduced to &quot;pick send, pick Joe, send message&quot; if the message
window can be configured to close or minimize after this &quot;quick send&quot;.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If there are extra gizmos like the AIM &quot;Search the Web&quot; bar, allow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the user to hide them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Another must.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5.  This is a little more out there, but skinnability a la WinAmp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would certainly attract a certain segment of the online crowd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Igh. But yes, it would attract certain ppl, so as long as you can
</I>&gt;<i> turn off skins and have it use your Windows/Mac/whatever colors
</I>&gt;<i> instead, this would be ok.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Also, it'd be nice if you could get a list of on-line users from
</I>&gt;<i> the systray in a menu-style. Like just right click on the icon in the
</I>&gt;<i> systray, go to the &quot;roster&quot; submenu or whatever and see what's there.
</I>&gt;<i> Clicking on someone's name in the menu could either do whatever the
</I>&gt;<i> default double-click action in your roster window is (presumeably
</I>&gt;<i> sending a message), or bring up a dialog with buttons to choose what
</I>&gt;<i> to do, from send message, file send, or whatever options. You might
</I>&gt;<i> make the tooltip for the icon include info like how many messages
</I>&gt;<i> pending, how many users in your roster are on-line, how many have
</I>&gt;<i> showed up/left since the prog was last unminimized, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On 5 Aug 99,, Jerrad Pierce sounded off on [JDEV] UI:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have 3 better words: modular modular modular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why should I even have to have the forsaken search bar, etc. In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory if I'm not displaying it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I agree completely -- However, making it modular as you've
</I>&gt;<i> suggested is just one way of making it configurable -- A very good
</I>&gt;<i> way, too. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On 5 Aug 99,, Scott Robinson sounded off on Re: [JDEV] UI opinions..:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Microsoft had the right idea when it allowed users to just drag
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and drop the buttons they liked onto the tool bar.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Configurability with simplicity is the way everyone _wants_ to go,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but getting there seems to be the problem. Bars or menus? Both?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I agree; nothing I said goes against allowing you to simply drag
</I>&gt;<i> and drop buttons (not that you said it did, but just to clarefy), in
</I>&gt;<i> fact where I referred to a &quot;graphical toolbar creation tool,&quot; I was
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of things like allowing simple drag &amp; drop rearrangement and
</I>&gt;<i> such. But, it might be convenient to also have a central toolbar
</I>&gt;<i> manager you can go to, and I want it to be extremely extensible, so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want it limited to a set of standard buttons, which is why I
</I>&gt;<i> think it'd be good to specify buttons similarly to how I said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While the ICQesque interface is generally agreed to be evil, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is what the user expects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Really? I find the interface of ICQ 98 quite nice. Then again, I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't touch ICQ 99 with a 10 foot pole... Bloatware....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Skins? Customizable UI? If we wrote a standard (read portable)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber client that supported radical modification of the UI with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; few nice defaults that we created, I would think this would solve
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all our problems. You may say &quot;but that would be to hard! Think of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all the code we'd have write to specialize the interface...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    This sounds like SUCH a good idea. I would love to see this
</I>&gt;<i> happen...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When that Jabber install program boots up, its only question should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be &quot;How do you want Jabber to look? ICQ/AIMesque? mIRCesqe? ...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Agreed. Optimally, it should also bring up screen shots when you
</I>&gt;<i> click each one :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As always, I'm officially &quot;on crack&quot; so anything I say can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disregarded.
