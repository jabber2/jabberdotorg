<PRE>&gt;<i> Slashdot effect? ;)
</I>
*heh*, yeah... But I'm still alive and kicking!  I only had to reboot
myself twice ;-)

&gt;<i> Whoa! I may be missing something here. While Jabber, in it's current state,
</I>&gt;<i> is a server-to-server paradigm, if we want Jabber to be any type of success
</I>&gt;<i> in the real world it's clients will support CTCP. 
</I>
Hmm... ok, maybe *I* am missing something, explain why we need CTCP to be
a success? (Disregarding file transfer and streaming, which does need to
be CTCP and will be addressed)

&gt;<i> I guess I'll be holding off on my MIME, CTCP, and Security posts.
</I>
Sounds good, I'll get it out ASAP here(when I return home in a few hours).

&gt;<i> On a side note, most of your post implies you have ultimate control over the
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber protocol?
</I>
Nope, I'm just the most familiar with it and the reasons for it's design.
In fact, there have already been numerous outside suggestions that are
part of the protocol.  I guess I'm just the over-seer for the time being,
so convince me that it can't already be done in the existing protocol or
existing structures could be expressed in a better way and it'll get
changed.  

&gt;<i> Are we in any way open source? If so, how will submissions
</I>&gt;<i> work? For ideas to be added to the protocol, do we work on convincing you?
</I>
Yes, all source code is GPL.  I'm working on shifting the focus away from
me and towards the &quot;Core Team&quot;.  There's not much there yet, but we should
have a nice little team page up at core.jabber.org in time.  At the
moment, the members that I consider &quot;Core&quot; are nkirsch, tcharron,
and dsmith.  If anyone else is interested in becoming part of the main
team, just stay involved keep contributing suggestions/code for various
aspects of Jabber :)
