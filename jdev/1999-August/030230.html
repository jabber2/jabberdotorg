Sorry if I'm thick, but what would be the reason for switching 
charsets in mid-stream of document parsing?  Wouldn't the entire XML doc be 
normalized to one standard, and, given a message encoding parameter, the 
client would decide what it wants to do with the normalized characters?  My 
understanding is that the XML markup itself should never deviate from a 
pre-stated charset, but the CDATA might (which, really, the parser doesn't 
care about, right?).  If a standard is set, it will ultimately be the 
client's responsibility to make sure all outgoing messages are 
normalized, and all incoming messages are reconstituted in their favorite 
Star Trek dialect.

Should you really rely on the facility of XML to use different charsets?  
Really the only thing that needs to change charsets is the CDATA of 
users' messages.  The markup itself never needs to deviate from a set 
standard encoding.  This standard encoding should be broad enough to be 
able to store every other encoding clients might want to use.  You don't 
want to change the nature of the messenger based on the characteristics 
of the message (if that makes any sense).
