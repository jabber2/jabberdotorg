<PRE>I was thinking about this today as I watched Poke'mon. There has been a
large push for e-mail'esque extensions to the current Jabber standard. I
also think that you are correct in wanting to hold off canonizing many of
these ideas.

However. However, I believe that you (from what I've seen) tend to clamp
down on the blosoming of new ideas a bit hard, if only because you realize
we need to get Jabber 0.7 out. I'm with you on this, and with one example of
the MIME thread I believe it did get a bit out of hand. I would ask that
you, at the very least, let *small* discussions of new features continue. At
the most, create a intentionally high-traffic (maybe with no archive to save
space?) list for ideas?

Scott.

&gt;<i> It's a very natural path to try and turn Jabber into a &quot;better email&quot;, but
</I>&gt;<i> that wasn't and isn't the intention.  I'm not saying that any of those
</I>&gt;<i> features are unnecessary, some are and will be needed by Jabber, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> a dangerous road to follow when you start mimmicking the email system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I'd like to suggest is that we wait until after 0.7, after we are all
</I>&gt;<i> *USING* Jabber regularly we'll have a much better feel for what kind of
</I>&gt;<i> additional features we'll need like unique id's, server tracking,
</I>&gt;<i> filtering, spam prevention, etc.  But until then, we're all just talking
</I>&gt;<i> smoke and mirrors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So let's just concentrate on getting 0.7 out the door with what we already
</I>&gt;<i> have going in the protocol and the new MIME, info/query, and file transfer 
</I>&gt;<i> additions.  There's more than enough work to be done, after we get there
</I>&gt;<i> we can pick up these issues again.  Sort of a mini-feature-freeze :)
