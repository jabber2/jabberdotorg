I am strongly inclined to agree with Eliot and Kemal. I don't want Jabber to be
linked to corporate &quot;interests&quot;. Why? Because what if I have a problem with AOL?
I can choose not to ever use AIM or talk to people on AOL through that
transport, but if Jabber is tied to AOL like this (at the transport/server
level) then all the clients would have to have the banner.

Consider that Jabber would also then be paying for the ability to talk to AIM
users. Granted its more like bartering than paying cash, but do we want to be
paying for the ability to talk to other transports? What if some other IM
&quot;provider&quot; decides that it would like to go that route?

Banner's suck and being tied to a company sucks just as much if not more,
especially when the end user ends up with no choice but to accept it.

Chris
