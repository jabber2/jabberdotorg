Conversely, what HTTP/1.1 headers (that actually make sense in the 
context of Jabber) cannot be represented in MIME?  As far as I know, MIME 
functionality migrated to HTTP and not the other way around.  It just so 
happens that HTTP decided to include the specification of the data it was 
transporting into the actual protocol.  This doesn't, for instance, happen 
in FTP...it's either Ascii or Binary, and you have to layer any extra 
specification on top of that.  In the case of FTP there *doesn't* 
happen to be a coincidental overlap in functionality, which is where the 
common ground of MIME (over any protocol) seems to make sense to me.

I should probably go read the file transfer docs...
