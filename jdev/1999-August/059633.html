<PRE>On 6 Aug 99,, Vivre Draco sounded off on Re: [JDEV] UI opinions..:

&gt;<i> Also, you might set it to show any new user who comes on-line in
</I>&gt;<i> this miniwindow for a few seconds or something. 
</I>
   I'd like to expand on this idea and suggest that it might be a 
useful feature even when you have your client totally minimized. 
Maybe you could set something up so that whenever a new user comes on-
line, a tooltip appears nears the systray icon displaying the new 
user's name for a few seconds. While not very eye-catching, this 
would be useful if accompanied by a sound.

   Speaking of sounds, along a similar but probably more complex 
vain, I would love text-&gt;speech support. This has two main uses: 
First, rather than playing some little wav that tells you &quot;someone&quot; 
came on-line then having to open your client to see who (or flick 
your eyes down to the tooltip...), it could say &quot;joe is on-line.&quot; 
Second, when you walk away from the computer to fix yourself a snack, 
you could turn on &quot;vocalize incoming messages&quot; and hear whatever 
comes in, and decide whether it's something worth going over to your 
computer to reply to before you finish your snack or not.

   I'd also like to take this opportunity to repeat my suggestion 
that you make any toolbars completely customizeable. That way, if you 
often use the feature mentioned above, you can have a button right on 
your toolbar to toggle it... And if you never use it, it doesn't have 
to waste your screen space.
