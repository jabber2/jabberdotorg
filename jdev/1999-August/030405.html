Really tho, storing privkeys on a server is a big no-no. It defeats the
purpose of using it for authentication and encryption.

For example, (and afaik) in the regular Jabber scheme, a person is
authenticated by a username and password. Then messages coming from
this person are 'known' to be real, because the person has to auth
with the server.

If the server is compromised, then there is no reassurence a person
is who they say they are.

Therefore, people use digital signatures. You can trust a digsig
from me if it's a) signed by someone you trust, and b) you believe
I am the only person with access to it.

If my privkey is stored on the server, locked by my Jabber password,
then anyone who can get my password OR compromise the server, can 'be'
me. This provides no more security than the password-only system,
and requires considerably more work.

I envisage a system, where only one of the Jabber users 'nicks' are
crypto-enabled, it being the one that currently has the key. When
a crypted message is sent (in the &lt;ext&gt; tags?) a plaintext message
is sent to the non-crypto clients informing them that someone has
sent a message they can't read. It would be nice, if perhaps
user-unfriendly, to enforce the policy that only one crypto-enabled
nick is active per user, as this is the only policy that truly
guarantees security.

While we have to aim for 'Grandma's IM', we shouldn't do so by sacrificing
security, or features. Does _your_ grandma use crypto?
