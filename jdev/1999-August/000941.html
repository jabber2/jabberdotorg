Hmm. Let me think a sec.

Ok, I'm about to make an idioitic comment, but it's only because I'm the
kinda guy that thinks this way. I see no reason not to allow for alternate
characters in XML. I'll allow the point that it would only cause confusion
later on and gives no functionality; however, in some future bizarre
universe everyone _could_ be sending data across whatever we use instead of
sockets in some strange charset. I would build in the functionality for the
_XML_ (not CDATA) being in alternate charsets.

Moving to the current CDATA topic... I believe many messages ago the
suggestion for adding a package for specifying what charset the CDATA is in
was made. There were arguments again, but they were
anti-internationalization ones. The only alternative given was a tag. A
&lt;message charset=&quot;charset/unicode&gt;...&lt;/message&gt; solution is the nicest one
in my mind.

&gt;<i> &gt; charset different from UTF-8, that the C/S should be able to use that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular feature. I would note, that if the C/S cannot understand UNICODE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (just an example) there should be a way of saying it. ala HTTP's &quot;Accept:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; charset/ascii, charset/utf-8&quot; and &quot;Deny: charset/unicode&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should you really rely on the facility of XML to use different charsets?  
</I>&gt;<i> Really the only thing that needs to change charsets is the CDATA of 
</I>&gt;<i> users' messages.  The markup itself never needs to deviate from a set 
</I>&gt;<i> standard encoding.  This standard encoding should be broad enough to be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to store every other encoding clients might want to use.  You don't 
</I>&gt;<i> want to change the nature of the messenger based on the characteristics 
</I>&gt;<i> of the message (if that makes any sense).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I believe my drivel was becoming overlapping. Let me seperate. The
&quot;messenger&quot; should be able to support different charsets and the &quot;message&quot;
inside should be able to be completely different.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Standardizing on UNICODE, though, might be a way to go. I'm not sure, but if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the C/S plain receives/sends ASCII, it could just convert inside and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone could be happy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
