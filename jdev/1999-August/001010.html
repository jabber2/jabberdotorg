<PRE>  Hey, I have a question..  Have you done any development with Perl on Win32?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GUILE! Guile is the up-and-coming extension language; it has the advantage of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being designed for the purpose unlike, f'rex, Perl. Plus, it's more civilized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than JavaScript. ;^) I do not know how easy it would be to embed Guile into a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Java program, but I hope to see *some* client use it; AFAIK it's a C library.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>First, to qualify my statements:  I've been developing in Perl for
</I>&gt;<i>years.  I've been developing in Java for over a year.  I've been
</I>&gt;<i>developing in Python for about 6 months.  I've also spent a few months on
</I>&gt;<i>a C project.  I've used both client and server side JavaScript on a large
</I>&gt;<i>project.  Rexx was my first programming language (assuming you don't count
</I>&gt;<i>Basic).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have read books on Eiffel and Tcl, and didn't really like either of
</I>&gt;<i>them.  I haven't spent any time reading about Lisp/Scheme, but I would
</I>&gt;<i>like to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In theory, I would also recommend Guile, because part of it's mission is
</I>&gt;<i>to allow script authors to use any language via scheme plugins that
</I>&gt;<i>translate that other language to scheme.   So far, I haven't actually seen
</I>&gt;<i>that been done for any of the popular scripting languages, ie: perl,
</I>&gt;<i>python, tcl.  I haven't been following Guile very hard, but I do feel that
</I>&gt;<i>expecting a slightly above average user to learn Scheme/Lisp just to
</I>&gt;<i>customize his client is unreasonable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Assuming that we also want a scripting language that can be used on Unix,
</I>&gt;<i>Mac and Windows.  Also assuming that we also want a scripting language
</I>&gt;<i>that can be embedded in both a C program and a Java program (pure Java,
</I>&gt;<i>not a C plugin)...  That narrows it down to Tcl and Python.  I think
</I>&gt;<i>JavaScript might be included here, but I don't know if there are
</I>&gt;<i>compatible C/Java versions, let alone free (speech) ones. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Assuming that we want a fairly easy to learn scripting language, one that
</I>&gt;<i>both experienced developers can code zillions of lines of code in, as well
</I>&gt;<i>as someone that's never scripted before being able to change a color here
</I>&gt;<i>or a font there.  I'd have to recommend Python.  It is the easiest
</I>&gt;<i>language I've ever learned, yet it's more powerful than many other
</I>&gt;<i>languages, and quite easy to read.  It also was designed to be object
</I>&gt;<i>oriented from the start, so it makes it easier to expose a clean
</I>&gt;<i>interface to the guts of the client.  Tcl was designed for people that
</I>&gt;<i>have done a lot of unix shell scripting, which seems a little biased to
</I>&gt;<i>me, windows and mac users aren't going to have any experience with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The only weird thing about Python is that it forces you to use indentation
</I>&gt;<i>to denote blocks of code, but now that I've used it for a while, I think
</I>&gt;<i>it's a very elegant solution, you never get indentation and
</I>&gt;<i>brackets/begin&amp;end statements confused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, that's my $0.02
