<PRE>What you said is along the lines in my head. I'll spew my thoughts some
more, since they have been a bit more refined.

First off, since we love being able to debug manually with telnet, the C/S
MUST support ASCII. Moreover, since UTF-8 has ASCII and it is the XML
standard, therefore the C/S should support UTF-8. There is really nothing
suprising here, but I'll just put that down.

Second, I was waiting for the proper time to discuss UNICODE... which was to
be my suggestion. Personally, and I'll admit I have not yet screwed around
with expat, although I've received the vibes it is quite difficult to change
charsets in mid-stream, I believe that since the XML standard allows for a
charset different from UTF-8, that the C/S should be able to use that
particular feature. I would note, that if the C/S cannot understand UNICODE
(just an example) there should be a way of saying it. ala HTTP's &quot;Accept:
charset/ascii, charset/utf-8&quot; and &quot;Deny: charset/unicode&quot;.

Standardizing on UNICODE, though, might be a way to go. I'm not sure, but if
the C/S plain receives/sends ASCII, it could just convert inside and
everyone could be happy.

The following comments are certified werid.

Scott.

&gt;<i> (Note: my terms might not be the most technically accurate, but this is to convey
</I>&gt;<i> a good overview)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, you can think of Unicode as having a character set that contains just
</I>&gt;<i> about all the characters you'd want to ever use, and maybe then some (there are
</I>&gt;<i> contingents working hard on getting Tolkien's Tengwar and Cirth, and StarTrek
</I>&gt;<i> Klingon in).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can then think of actually storing this large character set using different
</I>&gt;<i> encodings. UTF-8 and UTF-16 would be the two most common of these. UTF-16 has the
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of all characters being 16-bit. UTF-8 is variable length, and has the
</I>&gt;<i> advantage that the 7-bit US-ASCII range is preserved as-is in 8-bit characters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given that commands and such would be handy to be tested via telnet, that
</I>&gt;<i> standard English stays one-byte, etc., it probably best to standardize on UTF-8
</I>&gt;<i> being the one encoding to be used over the wire. Internally, the clients can be
</I>&gt;<i> recommended to use UTF-16, or whatever is most efficient to them, but only UTF-8
</I>&gt;<i> should be allowed to be exchanged. For UI input and output, the client might
</I>&gt;<i> convert to and from a platform-specific charset and encoding, but then go
</I>&gt;<i> straight to Unicode for all manipulation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One side-effect of standardizing the charset to Unicode would be that security
</I>&gt;<i> things such as passwords would be easy to handle on different systems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On MS Windows, COM works by stating that all strings are Unicode. Period. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> MS Offices does all it's work internally as Unicode, and converts whenever it
</I>&gt;<i> needs to get data in or out of a Windows system call. (this is because Windows 9x
</I>&gt;<i> has all the Unicode versions of API calls present but stubbed to return errors.)
</I>&gt;<i> I mention this as an example of &quot;gee, a company that mangles and avoids standards
</I>&gt;<i> as much as they do still complies in this area, so maybe we should too&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I would focus on the &quot;must accept.&quot; I'm fine with accepting UTF-8 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;UTF-16, however (and this is the reason they included a standard for pas=
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;encoding) we should also be able to handle internationalization. As the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Weren't the UTF encodings designed for internationalization?  Can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber be standardized to UTF-16 or something?  The size of messages is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; typically negligable (and on-the-fly compression would send that down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even more).  Clients would be responsible for displaying the UTF-16 chars
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever way they want (or perhaps include a flag in the message), via
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plugins or something (like Winamp's language packages).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;example was given, what would the Korean Jabber user think? Answer: they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wouldn't use Jabber...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;   The problem I can as far as I can see it is, unless we convert from cha=
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; rset to charset, we can't really provide for inter-charset communications..=
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the Jabber core (on the client) was standardized to some charset, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; couldn't it translate the charset to the standard if the user insisted on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using some input method with a non-standard charset?  If both outgoing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages (client-controlled), and all incoming messages to the client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (server-controlled) are in the same charset there is no problem.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   Switching charsets midstream =3D bad.  Throwing off a new expat object fo=
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; r each packet, IMHO, also =3D bad..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;   But I'm also not experienced at ALL in internationalization..  Heck, wh=
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; en I need to ./configure I always ./configure --disable-nls..  ;-P
