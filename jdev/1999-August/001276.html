I can create my own server and have it send a rejection reply to a
client on another server. This means either jabbertransport or client
(preferably the earlier if you ask me) needs to know what messages it has
sent in order to tell that a rejection reply (or indeed any reply) is
authentic. A rather tedious job.

Things could be simplified a little by fitting all messages with a one-way
encryption of some secret that is rotated once every week or so. This
would mean we only need to keep track of a small pile of secrets, rather
than the MD5 checksum or ID of all messages ever sent.

... or am I missing some obvious solution/information?
