<PRE>Sorry if I appear to be carping on about MIME, but this would be the 
case in which it would help.  The client would know what type of file it 
was, and then act accordingly, perhaps passing it on to a plugin.  For 
instance, text/plain could by default be handled internally by popping up 
a dialog with the message in it.  Somehow the info about what type of 
file it is, or how it is encoded needs to be stored somewhere.  Instead 
of relegating this to individual transports (which themselves are not 
necessarily tied to an encoding), or some new method of specification in 
the Jabber protocol, I am simply offering the suggestion that MIME be used.

I realize that this may be totally orthogonal to the other discussions at 
hand.
