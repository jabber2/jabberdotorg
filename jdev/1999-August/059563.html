<PRE>  Actually, I was thinking about that, and it's ENTIRELY possible to make the client have several different 'UI modes' of operation.  Basically, in Windows development, dialogs are resources..  I can include several dialogs that all function 'differently', and allow a configuration option to choose which sets to use..

  If the Win32 client ever does support skins on a larger scale (Aka, round windows, etc..), I will probrably end up buying a theme library and building a seperate client off of that, so as not to add to the bulk of the basic client..
