<PRE>Hi Mats,

  The reason for this is two-fold - one was to find who wants browse to
  still be active, the other was because I want to get browse right
  before re-activating it. You may notice that the configuration you
  have to put in the browse section of the jabber.xml file differs from
  the other examples in there (ie I use an item tag, others use a
  service or conference tag). This is because I am aiming to comply
  with the browse jep as it stands, following the spirit where a case is
  not clear. If i'm not doing it right inside the service, then i'd
  rather rip out the bad code and work in the new code in a better
  fashion. I'm already worried about supporting unicode node names, as
  i'm trying to find a C library I can use to give me the functions I
  need. We need a stable definition of a node name, along with a
  reference of how this can be achieved, I still recall JEP-0029, where
  it was stated that the node should have its case preserved, but be
  case-normalized for comparison. No-one was supporting that, even the
  jabberd server itself.

  I may have to break down and learn C++, so I can recode MU-Conference
  and make use of any better unicode support and/or libraries,
  especially in light of the recent speed increases in C++ code. I've
  avoided doing so up till now as I felt it would be best to finish what
  I have before moving onwards. 

Regards,

  David
