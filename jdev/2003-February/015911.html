Until the problem is solved on the protocol level and enough clients 
support it this patch could still be usefull for some. Besides that it 
should be possible to prefer this method is some specific cases, so if 
we fix this we should also include the *possibility* for the server to 
deny a client during login because another session with the same 
resource excists. (This should be no more than adding an error code I 
think).
