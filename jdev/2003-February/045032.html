AFAIK, SASL does not have user registration, just authentication. You 
may have seen the mechanism registration, which is the procedure for 
having the IANA recognize new authentication mechanisms.

</I>
Ordering of child elements within a stanza does not matter in the 
existing namespaces. Please let us know if you see documentation which 
contradicts this :-)

Since you cannot specify a required delivery path or required security 
parameters (read: only on encrypted connections, to servers with a 
certificate signed by a client-trusted CA),  SSL cannot and should not 
be used for end-to-end encryption. There is an informational draft which 
describes how many existing clients use OpenPGP for end-to-end 
encryption, and there are proposals on how to do this with the W3C XML 
Encryption recommendation.
