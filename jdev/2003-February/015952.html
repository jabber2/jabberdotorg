<PRE>I agree with Ulrich, 

There are allot of open source companies like: mySQL, Zend, etc... Those
provide open source licenses and also commercial services and products,
maybe you guys at Rhymbox should do it that way too. 

By the way I am a big fan of your client Rhymbox, it is beautiful and
very easy to use, I wish you guys allot of success in your endeavors,
and hope you make a client that will top the only rival for me outside
jabber client's the Trilian client, I really think that inside the
jabber client's you have no rival.

My wish list: A bit more extensibility thru the use of plug-ins.
		  The ability to see the stream in plain text like other
client's do is something that I wish for.
		  OOB made easy, drag and drop exchange of files, in out
of band connections.

PS: I know this is not Rhymbox list, but I think this licensing issue is
something that all developers will have to face sooner or later. And
having a reference on the list might help, maybe a licensing FAQ, on
jabber.org..

Just my 2cents...
		 
Best Regards, 
Daniel MD

Assunto: Re: [JDEV] Re: Open Source?

Hi, 

I guess it depends on the interpretation of open source. As long as
rhymbox
is not GPL'd, the term open source is more or less meaningless, for me
as a
developer all my source code is open source :)

I do not to stab sebastiaan, but i'd choose a proper license model... it
helps a lot. several companys wanted to obtain and buy/whatever
sourcecode from
me, too, and with a proper licence model everything gets sorted quite
fast. 

hope this helps...
