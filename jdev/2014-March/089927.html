</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have a use case where I would like to send a presence to a MUC that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I may have already joined and, even if I have, I want it to send me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the message history no matter what. Is there a way to do that or would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it require a protocol extension of some sort?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes and no.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Technically speaking, simply sending presence to a MUC and joining (thus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting the history and participants) are not the same thing. Sending a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proper MUC join (with the &lt;x/&gt; and the history control optionally
</I>inside it)
&gt;<i> &gt; to M-Link[*] will, therefore, give you the history you asked for, and
</I>all
&gt;<i> &gt; the occupant presence, even if you're already in the room.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I find this *extremely* useful - which is why I did things that way. A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use-case for this is where an S2S link is down when you reconnect your
</I>C2S,
&gt;<i> &gt; or the server crashes, or ... - all arguably edge cases, but they're
</I>solved
&gt;<i> &gt; very nicely this way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Other servers don't do this, though - I think they should.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you wanted to avoid the occupant presence, you'd want an extension
</I>which
&gt;<i> &gt; signalled this in much the same way that the history controls work.

</I>date.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Prosody was (AFAIK) the first server to do this. We specifically
</I>&gt;<i> checked for &lt;x xmlns=muc&gt;, and assumed it was a MUC join, even if the
</I>&gt;<i> user was already in the room. It worked wonderfully, but we had to
</I>&gt;<i> comment that out because of Gtalk resending directed presence every
</I>&gt;<i> few minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, I decided at the time correct  behaviour over flakey links was more
important than supporting buggy servers.

I suppose it could have been made an option, in retrospect, but I did
really appreciate the support on internet servers too.

&gt;<i> Did Google ever fix that? Or do Gtalk users joining M-Link chatrooms
</I>&gt;<i> get history sent over and over? We never removed the code from Prosody
</I>&gt;<i> in the hope that Google would fix their behavior and we would reenable
</I>&gt;<i> the feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I've no idea. I know it was quite irritating for a while use a Google
account with an M-Link chatroom.
