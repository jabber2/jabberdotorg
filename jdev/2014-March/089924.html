Yes and no.

Technically speaking, simply sending presence to a MUC and joining (thus
getting the history and participants) are not the same thing. Sending a
proper MUC join (with the &lt;x/&gt; and the history control optionally inside
it) to M-Link[*] will, therefore, give you the history you asked for, and
all the occupant presence, even if you're already in the room.

I find this *extremely* useful - which is why I did things that way. A
use-case for this is where an S2S link is down when you reconnect your C2S,
or the server crashes, or ... - all arguably edge cases, but they're solved
very nicely this way.

Other servers don't do this, though - I think they should.

If you wanted to avoid the occupant presence, you'd want an extension which
signalled this in much the same way that the history controls work.

Dave.
