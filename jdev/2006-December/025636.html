IMHO there are plenty of great places to host code -- SF, Google Code,
Savannah, etc. I don't particularly see a strong need for us to have one
that is Jabber-specific, but if people really really want that, then we
could do that at code.jabber.org or somesuch with SVN and Trac. But if
you want it then don't just say you want it, volunteer to help. :-)
