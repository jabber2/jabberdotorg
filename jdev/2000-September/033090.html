Im not sure how familiar you are with differences between TCP/UDP but I
would suggest doing some background reading on the subject. You made some
gross over simplifications and had some *interesting* interpretations on
the state of things. I would suggest a little reading before so you can
understand the real differences before you say things such as &quot;moving to
UDP is almost a fundamental flaw for an IM system&quot;. 

&gt;<i>The other

yep and TCP contributes to this - in general there is a fair bit of
overhead in maintanence. From memory the buffers are about 1k and can be
larger depending on OS/kernel mods. Think about - this buffer is much less
efficient representation than the Jabber router can represent data in - is
mostly empty when not completely empty.

I am not sure why CPU is a limiting factor thou - could you elaborate ?

&gt;<i>I'd be happy to discuss scaling further, as I'm working on scaling the server
</I>&gt;<i>to 10million users.
</I>
Good luck but I seriously doubt you will able to do this without massive
distribution or a large machine using TCP. Is there any equivelent systems
that even come close to that number using TCP ? I don't know any but .....

Cheers,

Pete
