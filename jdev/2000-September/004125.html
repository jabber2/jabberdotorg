<PRE>Dear people,

I would like to bring your attention to a scenario in Jabber.

1. USER A newly registers himself and logs in.
2. USER B newly registers himself and logs in.
3. USER A adds USER B into his roster. (No reply from the server??)
4  USER B didn't receive anything from the server regarding USER A, and when
USER B adds USER A, USER B didn't receive anything from the server too...and
USER A didn't receieve anything too.
5. After which, both of them logs off, and when they log in again, both
users starts receiving the overdue requests for addition into roster.
6. Subsequently, when both USER A and USER B delete each other and add each
other again, everything functions as it should.

I'm running the server right from the cvs.

My question is this:
Is this a bug or a feature?

Paul
