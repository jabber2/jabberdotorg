&gt;<i>I noticed IMUnified finished their spec on 8/31 as promised!

</I>&gt;<i>But where is it?!  Their press release says &quot;IMUnified is allowing companies
</I>&gt;<i>that have expressed interest in joining the coalition to have the
</I>&gt;<i>opportunity to review these specifications.&quot;, but it doesn't say how to
</I>&gt;<i>access the specs.  My emails to them go unanswered, and listed phone numbers
</I>&gt;<i>are for press inquiries only.

A few days ago my friend (who has a talent for guessing people's email 
addresses) took it upson herself to get in contact with Ross Bagully, who 
seems to be the main spokesperson for IMUnified.  He's CEO of TribalVoice 
and is the one quoted in most articles.  He said:

&gt;<i>I'm at least moderately familiar with Jabber, and don't disagree at all 
</I>&gt;<i>that communications between ya'all and IM Unified would be a good thing. 
</I>&gt;<i>As you probably know, this work has been proceeding pretty fast and 
</I>&gt;<i>furiously. What say we talk in RL to catch up and discuss this. At least, 
</I>&gt;<i>I return emails! My office is (XXX) XXX-XXXX, and I should be around most 
</I>&gt;<i>of today and tomorrow, then off for a long holiday weekend. Please call at 
</I>&gt;<i>your convenience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ross
</I>
Can we hand this off to someone who would be a good spokesperson for 
Jabber?  We missed him before the weekend, but I think that someone who is 
actually a key member of the Jabber team would be more effective than 
either of us.  Any volunteers?
