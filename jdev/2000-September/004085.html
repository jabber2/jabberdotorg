&gt;<i> I believe the &quot;out of band&quot; context is appropriate to distinguish between

</I>
The basic idea to remember when dealing with OOB stuff, is you can use jabber to create the sessions between two users, but binary data should not be passed through the server.. 

&gt;<i> obviously puts the responsibility of various types of file transfers and 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple connections on the client side. I'm curious if anyone sees a 
</I>
Yup.. most client authors are cool with this... the file transfers aren't that difficult to work with, and usually any other purpose is for a special &quot;dedicated&quot; client.

&lt;snip/&gt;
&gt;<i> How resource-intensive and &quot;bloated&quot; would an all-purpose client like 
</I>&gt;<i> WinJab become if it had to negotiate separate TCP, HTTP, SMTP, etc... etc.. 
</I>&gt;<i> connections?
</I>
Winjab already does.. for file transfers anyway.. it offers connections through direct HTTP, or WebDAV... smtp would use a transport.. file attachements would work like an OOB connection to the transport, so winjab would handle that the same way as any other oob file transfer.. etc.. 

The problem arises when you want to do other things, like VoIP, but, in reality, the client has to know what to do with the VoIP packets anyway, establishing them OOB isn't the hard part.. =] 

&gt;<i> Is this even an issue?? I guess browsers do this all the time... But who 
</I>&gt;<i> wants their client to become the next Mozilla?
</I>
Most Client authors don't seem to think this is an issue, as far as I'm aware... (you could always use the Mozilla Jabber client coming out.. *g*) 


&gt;<i> Sorry for waxing philosophic this early in the morning... :P
</I>&gt;<i>

Not a problem.. =}
