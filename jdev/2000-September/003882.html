<PRE>Kudos, Flint!  Bravo!  This articulates a LOT of what I've been trying to
tell people here while we have these incessant meetings on &quot;defining a
process&quot; for development.

I would say more, but I tend to start ranting when I think too much about
this subject.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [JDEV] Process
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Process
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why do we want a process?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	This is where one must realize that process is multi 
</I>&gt;<i> dimensional. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Programmers are usually heranged to describe their process.  
</I>&gt;<i> Which is an
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to imitate the mental process with something that is 
</I>&gt;<i> described in
</I>&gt;<i> words and generates documents.  While laudible, no process 
</I>&gt;<i> can imitate the
</I>&gt;<i> human mind.
</I>&gt;<i> Individuals outside of the programming loop want a process, 
</I>&gt;<i> so they have
</I>&gt;<i> points of interaction.  Places where there feedback can be 
</I>&gt;<i> introduced and
</I>&gt;<i> there timing considerations can be voiced and imposed on the 
</I>&gt;<i> process.  After
</I>&gt;<i> all, if you left everything up to programmers, they might 
</I>&gt;<i> just create killer
</I>&gt;<i> games all the time.
</I>&gt;<i> Interested individuals want a process so they can spy on 
</I>&gt;<i> productivity.  When
</I>&gt;<i> is the rewrite going to be done? When is this cool feature 
</I>&gt;<i> going to be out?
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone working on this feature? Can I get into this process? Can I
</I>&gt;<i> document the process and demonstrate culpability to clients?  
</I>&gt;<i> Can I change
</I>&gt;<i> the programs behaviour to do what I want it to do? ...
</I>&gt;<i> Why do we resist process?
</I>&gt;<i> 	
</I>&gt;<i> 	Process introduces overhead, creates interruptions, and exposes
</I>&gt;<i> individuals to needs beyond their own current concerns.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many projects have been ruined by process, and no project is 
</I>&gt;<i> ever created by
</I>&gt;<i> process alone.
</I>&gt;<i> Archiving is one of the first goals.  
</I>&gt;<i> 	Everyone has their own idea about what is useful documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Programmers want enough documentation, mostly in the code and 
</I>&gt;<i> possibly a few
</I>&gt;<i> README files, to provide hints in case they want to revisit 
</I>&gt;<i> some code they
</I>&gt;<i> have already written.  If you have the dubious privilege of inheriting
</I>&gt;<i> someone elses project ... suddenly you wish there was much more
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.  In most cases you don't want to learn the whole coding
</I>&gt;<i> paradigm that was used to create this 'wonderful' project, 
</I>&gt;<i> you probably just
</I>&gt;<i> want to get in and get out.  After all, no one programs as 
</I>&gt;<i> well as you do,
</I>&gt;<i> so you're anticipating the set of 'why did they do it that way?'.
</I>&gt;<i> Users want feature documentation ... what does the product 
</I>&gt;<i> do? How do I
</I>&gt;<i> interact with it?
</I>&gt;<i> Prototyping is one of the misunderstood creatures.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Someone heavily tied to a software lifecycle, is likely 
</I>&gt;<i> to be quite
</I>&gt;<i> miffed by the ad-hoc creativity of prototypes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	What does it do?  I'm not sure yet, but it's cool.
</I>&gt;<i> Timing is well misplaced.
</I>&gt;<i> 	A project can only be accurately documented after the fact.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Initial design is just a phase to kickstart the project 
</I>&gt;<i> and provide
</I>&gt;<i> steering, design should always be conducive to revisitation.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Deadends are just that and should be pulled out  or 
</I>&gt;<i> identified as
</I>&gt;<i> such.
</I>&gt;<i> Can we do without process?
</I>&gt;<i> 	Where there is activity, there is process.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is just a matter of identifying cost vs benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> But, a process will give us ...
</I>&gt;<i> 	Identifying the fruits desired must be the goal of process
</I>&gt;<i> definition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Programmers want a productive environment.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Projects want a productive project.
</I>&gt;<i> Freedom should be you're torch.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Open source is flourishing because it embraces freedom.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Freedom to create what you want.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Freedom to create what you need.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Freedom to share it with others.
</I>
