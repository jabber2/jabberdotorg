<PRE>I'm happy to see that I've gotten lots of enthusiastic emails regarding 
integrating a people-matcher into Jabber.  So it looks like I'll start a 
project.

A few things that have come out of the private emails:

1) For the most part, this will be a relatively straightforward transport.

2) The communication with hypermatch will in itself be an XML based, open 
protocol.  Other matching systems can support it too, and users should be 
able to subscribe to multiple matching systems at once.

3) We should look into ways of making this available to users of other IM 
systems (icq, aim etc), who have yet to be enlightened and joined the 
Jabber world.  Maybe it will be a good way to bring them in! :)

4) To work best, people-matching should be (minimally) accounted for in 
clients' user interfaces, however this is not strictly necessary.  In other 
words, you could still use the service if your client doesn't explicitly 
support it, but it won't be quite as elegant and / or 
convenient.  Editing/reviewing of profiles is *not* going to be part of the 
client, it makes more sense to be web based (at this point, anyway).

Now----how to start a project?  I figured I'd create a page for this, as 
well as a start a mailing list.  Is egroups acceptable for a mailing 
list?  How do I get a project put on jabber.org?
