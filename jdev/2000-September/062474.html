<PRE>Quoting Sellaro &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">sellaro at lia.ufc.br</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Suppose I am using jabber.org server while I set up my own jabber
</I>&gt;<i> server. I build up my roster, get subscription permit from lots of
</I>&gt;<i> people. OK, my roster is OK at jabber.org. But when my jabber server is up
</I>&gt;<i> and running, will I have to rebuild my roster? 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be a very nice research and implementation matter ;)
</I>
  Due to the nature, yes, you would, for this reason primarily.  Subscriptions 
are two way streets.  Sure, you have a list of people in your roster, that you 
are subscribed to, and are subscribed to you.  But would you really like it if 
you could just 'MOVE' your presence like that?  How would you go about 
authorizing the move of that data?  If you have 20 users accross 5 servers, all 
6 would need to be involved in the move.  Not to mention, instead of simply 
stealing your roster, and pretending I'm you, I can quite literally hijack your 
identity, move the virtual 'you' to another location, with you being none the 
wiser untill something bad happens..  Ick..  ;-P

  Think of it this way.  You give your phone number and address to many people 
over time.  Then you move to another state.  You can setup your old address and 
phone number to 'forward' to your new one, but never can you 'make' your old 
address your new one magically.  You need to inform the indivuals mailing you 
of your new address.  mod_filter provides the forwarding..  ;-P  Better safe 
then sorry..  ;-P
