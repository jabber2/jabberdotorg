<PRE>Priority number (which defaults to 0 on most clients) is only one
criteria - if the dedicated client is the only client on-line it get's
all messages for that JID, including other &quot;parallel&quot; resources. It will
also take over as primary if priorities are equal and it's the last
client to connect. According to jer and temas this is correct (default)
behavior. I'm not sure I agree, but mod_filter makes it a moot point
because I can customize the delivery behavior by resource. I need to
look into this some more because I need to see if I have set these
options resource by resource instead of being able to somehow say &quot;only
deliver to this resource if it's meant for this resource&quot;. Messing with
priorities makes sense when you have a couple (or know quantity) of
clients, but gets to be a pain when every appliance in the house has a
built in client and they are going on and off line all the time.
temas suggested an x10 transport instead of a client and the more I
think of it the more I like the idea - but it's an option for me because
I control the server and know the secret key. Those without that kind of
access would be stuck having to install their own server and forwarding
message from their primary server (mod_filter comes in handy again).
One of my goals here is to eliminate all of the specialized pop-up and
messaging tools I use now (callerid, winpopup, biff, qpager) and point
it all to my jabber account - so that as SMS, WAP, and pager-t
transports and clients come online, jabber can handle getting this
diverse stream of info to me in a consistent manner.
