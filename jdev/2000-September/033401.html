<PRE>I am trying to grasp how transports work, but I have found no documentation
except source code (thanks to Net::Jabber!). But it would be nice to be able to
see something in print:

What is the jabber:server namespace? Does it define a required id atribute?
Does it change the semantics of such things as message, precense and iq in any
way?

And is there any docu on the etherx namespace. If I understand it correctly you
need an etherx:secret in the stream header, and then you need ethetx:to and
etherx:from in packets, but what packets, and what should go into these
atributes, the server name? And are there more etherx attributes that should be
used?

And then a question about performance. In the examples I have seen, a transport
opens an XML-Stream (via a socket) and sends and recives packets through this
channel. The transport is identifyed via the stream and the jabber server (or
etherx) knows to route packages destined to the transports. Is this not a
potential performance bottleneck? A transport will typically support many
clients
and will send and recive a lot of packets - and it would be good if it could do
it concurrently. Have I missed something completely? Is it possible to open
several streams to etherx from one transport? How does the server find wich
stream to use to talk to the transport, by id perhaps?

Or is transports discussed in another forum?
