  PLEASE consider creating a mod_udp to do this.  It would extend the current 
system, and add UDP support to it.  To look at how messages can be buffered 
before sending/recieving via UDP, an interesting way would be to look at 
mod_http, which does exactly that, but instead translates it for HTTP requests.

</I>&gt;<i> world where scalability is an issue.

  No questions there.  The libpth issue is also big..

&gt;<i> Anyway I haven't started the server yet and wont for some time so I should

  Please don;t feel you have to 'put out or shut up'.  All feedback is welcome 
by everyone.  Having been popping in and out for nearly a year and a half, I've 
found that no one here ever takes that approach.  They probrably should have 
BELTED me a few times (looks around, preparing to duck in case of acceptance of 
the proposal), never once has it been a 'sit down and shut up' discusion..  ;-P
