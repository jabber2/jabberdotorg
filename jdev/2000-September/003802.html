<PRE>That felt very stabbish to me, but I'll survive.  I've done my homework, and 
have discussed this with jer many times throughout the development of the
server.  We made design decisions based on the needs that we had at the time,
and the best solutions.  At that time, and in many ways still so, it was TCP.

Not to rehash those arguments, I'll state one thing.  We pride ourselves more
on our protocol, and idealogy, part of that is the ability for jabber to run
over different mechanisms.  So UDP could be implemented into the server, and
everything could be made to run over that.  This would then give clients the
choice to use it.  Patches are always accepted =)

In short to quote pieces of a conversation with jer (about getting togther a 
technical FAQ so we don't answer these same questions over and over):

&lt;jer&gt; why xml?  why c?  why anything?  because those were the initial goals... why debate HISTORY, instead creating options for the FUTURE is far more productive
&lt;jer&gt; a goals-&gt;implementation-&gt;feedback-&gt;goals CYCLE is FAR more productive than just getting it right in one pass
