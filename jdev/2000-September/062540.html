<PRE>The Jabber Server 1.1.1 (Developer Release) is now available at:
	
<A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.1/">http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.1/</A>

Included are the two dependencies: libxode and libjabber.  These are
backwards compatible with 1.0 and can be installed to the same location.

This is a *developer* release: it doesn't upgrade from a 1.0 setup, it
hasn't been tested on all platforms, it doesn't install, it doesn't
support the 1.0 style transports, and it may simply not function correctly
or require some tweaking.

That said, a good deal of time and effort has gone into this release.
It's the first release of the new server architecture and is already
almost up to the functionality of 1.0.  The new architecture (similar to
a component architecture) brings a huge amount of flexibility and provides
new ways to extend and customize the server.  We're working on a document
to describe this in more detail and plan on making a draft of that
available next week.  Future developer releases will contain more examples
to demonstrate the potential of the new architecture as well.

The plan is to have a few fast 1.1 developer releases, and quickly (couple
weeks to a month at most) release a stable 1.2, then begin on another
developer series 1.3 (the switch to pthreads and many new features).

Keep Jabbering!

Jer
