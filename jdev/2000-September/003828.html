<PRE>Note also that the IETF people seem to have made some progress.
On their website <A HREF="http://www.imppwg.org,">http://www.imppwg.org,</A> there are now two new
drafts, both related to interoperability.

They are taking the tack that we should shoot for interoperability and define
those
entities that occur in between systems rather than inside specific
implementations
of IM.

Thus they will specify what a message is and kinds of messages but not what an
inbox
should be beyond the fact that there will be one etc.
The major point of difference I see is that the IETF &quot;interoperability profile&quot;
defines the
body of an IM message as a MIME body.

Interesting reading even if for no other reason than the authors include Dave
Crocker
(author of RFC822) and Marshall Rose (author of SNMP and POP3).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TribalVoice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and is the one quoted in most articles.  He said:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;As you probably know, this work has been proceeding pretty fast and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;furiously. What say we talk in RL to catch up and discuss
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this. At least,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;I return emails! My office is (XXX) XXX-XXXX, and I should

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please call at

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;Ross
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can we hand this off to someone who would be a good spokesperson for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber?  We missed him before the weekend, but I think that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone who is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually a key member of the Jabber team would be more effective than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either of us.  Any volunteers?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might want to pass this information to someone here at Jabber.com, which
</I>&gt;<i> might be able to deal with this more effectively.  If you email me the
</I>&gt;<i> contact info, I'll be happy to pass it onto someone within our organization
</I>&gt;<i> who might be able to deal with this.  (Actually, given that we now know it's
</I>&gt;<i> the CEO of TribalVoice, we may have this information already...and I believe
</I>&gt;<i> that TribalVoice is headquartered in Denver, as are we...)
