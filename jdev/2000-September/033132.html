<PRE>I was asking specifically about the &quot;instant drawing pad&quot; idea. Has this
been proposed or developed here? If not, have you ever seen it?

As for the code, I guess I'm probably taking a boring formal approach
compared to the way these projects normally run - write a spec, then do
OOAD, then code, etc. I'm still conceptualizing this product, though I am
collecting snippets and ideas along the way. Now I see the importance of
communicating with developers like yourselves, since there's so much
technology coming out (xsl, svg, etc.) that it becomes very easy to
duplicate a technology or an api within your product, or simply to overlap
some other development project (like UPL overlapping jabber functionality).
I'm interested in avoiding this as much as possible, or to state the
positive, to leverage and incorporate as much existing technology as
possible, and so I hope to take some time to read through more jabber
documentation so I can understand the similarities and differences between
what I'm doing and the jabber project.

It sounds interesting and nearly all of the IM parts have been thought about
for Jabber and they can be done (Math stuff with MathML, drawing stuff with
SVG or something similar). But the question in my mind is: show me the code.
