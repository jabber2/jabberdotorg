okay didn't know this - do you have a link to Oscar ?

&gt;<i>Also realize that there are lots and lots of clients out there - my

</I>&gt;<i>World Domination (tm). One of the major goals (perhaps *the* major goal) of
</I>&gt;<i>Jabber was to make client authoring simple.
</I>
easy enough if we write a lib backend that is portable and anyone can use =)

&gt;<i>Finally, the last four companies I've worked at (read: EVERY company I've
</I>&gt;<i>worked at which had a computer) has had my computer situated behind a proxy.
</I>&gt;<i>Most Universities now use proxies for all their computers (I know University
</I>&gt;<i>of Florida even proxies the residence halls.) And I have a NAT proxy at
</I>&gt;<i>home, so that my notebook can access the internet through my linux 'server'.
</I>&gt;<i>How do these computers connect, if at all, on a UDP system?
</I>
UDP sits behind a NAT proxy in same method TCP does :P. Actually thats how
a lot of UDP applications work (mostly games) behind Proxies :P

Cheers,

Pete
