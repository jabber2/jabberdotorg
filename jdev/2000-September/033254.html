<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. It seems like Jabber, by design, expects each new user to register 
</I>&gt;<i> himself on the server, and then has to subscribe to all the hosts he wants 
</I>&gt;<i> to talk to, provided the other host allows this by advertising his presence.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there really no way for all registered users to show up in the list? Are 
</I>&gt;<i> admins expected to send a new user a copy of his rogue list so that newbies 
</I>&gt;<i> get this list instead of building their own?
</I>
The general path is to create an account, and then have that user subscribe to
services they would like (rss-transport for news, aim-transport for AOL's
Instant Messenger, etc), as well as to users they would like to have in their
list running Jabber or any transport-based (proxied) third party system.

There is of course nothing that says this has to be done from a user client - it
could be done server-side via creation of a new XML file for the user, new
database entries, etc. If you were running a site that lets you invite friends
(maybe something like a chat feature for sixdegrees.com), you could scan people
who are available, and automatically add those people who your data shows are
'friends'.

If you mean importing a roster from these other services - both ICQ and AIM are
client-side roster based, so there really isn't a way for the user to pull in a
roster from these services - so making them available (to anything except a
'smart wizard' which imports their rosters into your jabber account) is next to
impossible.

I am not familiar with systems which store their rosters server-side (AOL's TOC
protocol does, but it really isn't deployed - probably &lt;5k users at one time) -
I do not know if the transports really have a method of doing a massive import
of the server-side roster once you sign up for one of these services.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Is group chat the solution? I couldn't get this working. After adding a 
</I>&gt;<i> groupchat, no user shows up in the member list on the right hand-side. I 
</I>&gt;<i> followed instructions at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2000-July/002455.html,">http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2000-July/002455.html,</A> but NOK:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I can't really debug your configuration, but I can point you to irc.jabber.org
or conference.jabber.org - both which support groupchat. I do not believe you
need a jabber.org account to use these either - if you have a client you can
just do a 'join group' or something similar putting either of those services as
a name.

Group #jabber on server irc.jabber.org (actually irc.openprojects.net) is
usually pretty busy.
