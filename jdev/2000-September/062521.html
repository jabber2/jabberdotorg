<PRE>Quoting Peter Antman &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">Peter.Antman at abc.se</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I recently discovered Jabber (through Linux Journal) and finds it very
</I>&gt;<i> interesting. I am currently trying to understand its architecture. My first
</I>&gt;<i> reaction was, aha - an open source XML based Message-oriented middleware 
</I>&gt;<i> (MOM) product. Then I started reading the documentation and realized it was
</I>&gt;<i> Instant Messaging product with the ability to send messages from one node 
</I>&gt;<i> (entity) to another - Point-to-Point in MOM lingo (PtP)-, and to subscribe 
</I>&gt;<i> to another user/entity's presence - Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) in MOM
</I>&gt;<i> lingo.
</I>&gt;<i> And this is fine, and Jabber is really making its way in this category of 
</I>&gt;<i> software. 
</I>
  This is where things get interesting.  You see, at a point, the definition of 
a 'endpoint' begins to blur.  If your producer is connected as a client, 
sending to a client, you are point to point.  The primary issue here is, in all 
reality, there is no primary 'server' here.  Sure, there's the jabber server, 
but it's called a 'transport'.  If you where going to use jabber for 
disemination of this type of data, you'r producer would most likely be, another 
transport, which is part of the server side of things, not really a client.  
But it is..  ;-P  Confused yet?

&gt;<i> Then I started reading the Jabber Internet-Draft. And in the connectionmap
</I>&gt;<i> in 
</I>&gt;<i> section 2 one finds something different, namely a transport meant to
</I>&gt;<i> provide
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;real time data to Jabber, such as log notification&quot;. It's a part of 9.1
</I>&gt;<i> too:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Any server-side entity can easily participate in the real-time generation 
</I>&gt;<i> and delivery of XML&quot;.
</I>
  Note the wording here.  'server-side entity'.  This probrably best describes 
a transport.  They are all servers.  But they're clients to eachother.  They 
may indeed have clients themselves, making them servers.  But they make use of 
other resources, making them clients..  ;-P

&gt;<i> This is interesting, and sort of makes Jabber look a little more like a MOM
</I>&gt;<i> again.
</I>
  It is, but doesn't follow the traditional model that a message oriented 
middleware would.  It builds much of the front *AND* back tier into the system 
itself.


&gt;<i> The problem is this: I can not find any documentation in the protocols for 
</I>&gt;<i> such a feature, if you do not interpretate the quotes above in a naive way.
</I>
  Unfortionatly, code was being bashed out for a while here, and much of the 
conceptual documentation has gone to the side.  This does need to be revamped.  
Most of the documentation has been on the jabber client end, which talks to 
the 'jabber transport'.  That's a narrow view of the jabber world..  That's 
prob what you're missing.  What's going on on the server side of the fence..

&gt;<i> My interpretation is this (it might be naive too ;-)): There is some though
</I>&gt;<i> that it should be possible to have a real time feed of data of some sort and 
</I>&gt;<i> that users/clients should be able to get this data send to them as
</I>&gt;<i> messages.
</I>&gt;<i> If this is true, it would mean that Jabber would have to have support for 
</I>&gt;<i> Publish and Subscribe for a specific types of messages (topic in MOM
</I>&gt;<i> lingo), and it would start to look like a MOM again.
</I>
  Exactly.  This would be done by subscription.  Subsription is used to tell 
something/someone you want some data.  It's also used as a way to have the idea 
that someone can 'subscribe' to your presence, which is, in a way, a way for a 
server to be a client to you.  They work hand in hand.  You login, and send 
presence to the server.  The server you are connected to looks at who you've 
approved subscriptions to, and let's them all know you're online.  They, in 
turn, do what they wish with this.  One of the many things would be, start 
streaming data.  When you then log off, subscription is once again checked, and 
authorized parties are informed you are no longer online.  In a way, both sides 
of the coin are clients.  But they're both servers.  ;-P  Middleware, yes, but 
here, everythings in the middle, except specifically for the jabber client.  
It's definatly a client.  But then again, it can serve as a server by 
specificaly informing a destination of presence, without telling the server at 
all..  ;-P

&gt;<i> Why do the quotes imply that? Because the only other way I can see it is that 
</I>&gt;<i> the publishing source (the live data feed) would have to know the identity of 
</I>&gt;<i> every one interested in getting the message - and if I understand the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> correct, such a real time event notifier would have to send each individual a 
</I>&gt;<i> separate message.
</I>&gt;<i> Much like you do in a mailing program by defining a private 
</I>&gt;<i> group to send to (which mean that if more than one publishing party should be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to participate in the feed, rosters must be distributed between all 
</I>&gt;<i> sending parties).
</I>
  Yes, but you subscribe to the 'service' provided by the service.  ;-P  Note, 
you may also allow the service to subscribe to you, but not subscribe to it.  ;-
P  There are really 4 levels of subscription.  To, From, Both, and None.


&gt;<i> The logic of the presence mechanism - but applied to messages, would be a 
</I>&gt;<i> more well designed solution to this feature; sort of like a mailing list 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality in Jabber (with both half and full duplex). 
</I>
  Yes and no.  I've actually written a mailing list transport that does exactly 
this.  It recieves a message destined for a list.  It looks at everyone who 
is 'subscribed' to that list, and mirrors it out to all parties wishing this 
data.  In this case, the data being transmitted was generated from internal to 
the jabber system.  It could have just as easily been generated by the 
transport form, oh, say a news or stock feed.

&gt;<i> Is this being thought about, is there any plans to implement such 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality, or is it there already, without me being able to find it? Is
</I>&gt;<i> it possible to interpret and use the groupchat functionality for this?
</I>
  Can be, and is very easily done.  The possibilities for the system are 
staggering, and the documentation as of recent, *BESIDES* the JPG (Jabber 
Programmers Guide, has been lacking.  The JPG, <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/jpg/,">http://docs.jabber.org/jpg/,</A> is 
a good overview from the world according to the client.  Check it out, it may 
help a bit..

  Sorry if this reply basically sucks.  Just been a busy day, and didn;t have 
to time to reply correctly, but it needed to be replied to..
