I've written a very basic transport that does bi-directional (from
jabber first though) communication with GSM (SMS) cellphones.  It
isn't very nice, and just does messages.  The GSM cellphone company
here (Vodafone New Zealand) has a bidirectional SMS &lt;-&gt; email
gateway, so I just used that to get messages to and from a cellphone.

I'm no programmer and have only a very basic idea of how jabber works
so somebody else should be able to write a much better one.  I
basically just wrote it to see if I could.  Also only works with
people using Vodafone New Zealand and have signed up to use the email
gateway.

A really good one should be able to be written by cellphone companies
since they have full access to the cellphone network = access to text
messages AND presence information. (perhapes I should forward this
message to my cellphone company :-) ).

I guess this would work better as a client or by using that mod_filter
thing that I keep hearing about (message is forwareded to the
transport if no other client is online) so that the cellphone was the
last option used to get a message to somebody.
