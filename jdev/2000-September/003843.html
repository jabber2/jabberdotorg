That's what I'm here for. :)

Just a quick note here.. clients that don't support XHTML Basic are not &quot;legacy&quot; systems. No client should be forced to support anything more than they don't want to. Think of a CLI client that really has no use for XHTML (perhaps some, but not much). 

&gt;<i> I think it would be better to

</I>&gt;<i> text, and then send only the rich text one.
</I>
This presents problems. What if I'm offline and you can't &quot;grep&quot; my client to see if I support XHTML Basic? Or probably more likely, what if I'm online with two clients, one that does support XHTML Basic and one that doesn't. Now if I have the XHTML Basic client's resource as a top priority, your client would just send messages to me in XHTML Basic and not have plain text messages. The problem comes in when my XHTML Basic client suddenly goes offline. Now my plain text client is stuck with a blank message that it can't read. The point is that we're trying for maximum flexibility.
