<PRE>   I'm working on some dedicated clients and I'm not sure I understand
the rules for deliver when multible JID's are logged in. I login with
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at jabber.srvr</A>/Work and get any messages to my complete JID
(<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at jabber.srvr</A>/Work  - makes sense :), my incomplete JID
(<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at jabber.srvr</A> - Still makes sense ;), but I also seem get messages
meant for other resources (as long as they aren't logged in) This
doesn't make sense to me - I makes it difficult for me to have dedicated
clients logged in that don't &quot;steal&quot; messages meant for me. I'm working
on an x10 client for my firecracker that I would like to connect with
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at jabber.srvr</A>/x10 and have it only receive messages to that complete
JID.
    Is there are good reason for the &quot;cross resource&quot; deliver to happen?
If so, would it make sense to have a special priority (-1?) that would
say to the server, &quot;I only want what's really meant for me!&quot; 
Is this delivery algorithm documented anyplace other than the server
code? 
If I had to guess it goes something like:

1. If JID/1 had a higher priority than JID/2, deliver message for JID to
JID/1
2. even if JID/1 had a higher priority than JID/2, deliver message for
JID/2 to JID/2
3. If JID/1 and JID/2 have the same priority, deliver to the last one to
connect.
4. If JID/1 is the only one connected deliver JID and JID/1 messages
there.
5, if JID/1 is the only one connected deliver JID/2 messages there.

It's the 5th rule that I think should be changed to store the message
instead of delivering it.

case 4 should also be extended to say that JID/1/A... messages will also
be delivered to JID/1

Please feel free to reorder my neurons if they seem out of whack here...
