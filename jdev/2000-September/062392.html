<PRE>Thanks Thomas, this is a great summary and well spoken version of what I was 
trying to get at in my last post to this thread.

I would like to point out that multicast is being looked at for some of the
massive scaling solutions.  Even though it is a highly specific case, it is
a great thing.

Conversation is good all, keep it going.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I disagree. TCP makes poor use of today's networks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How many times do you think a message should get onto the wire?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; n times through n TCP connections, or once via a broadcast/multicast?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   In our case, not many times.  We cannot broadcast via Multicast over what 
</I>&gt;<i> basically ammounts to a massive WAN.  While I agree with many points you make 
</I>&gt;<i> regarding UDP, Multicast isn't one of them..  ;-P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree on that, but TCP doesn't make things easier.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Shouldn't we find a way to abstract the transport layer? Using a plug-in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; architecture?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   There already is.  Just as mod_http servers as a 'front end' and serves as 
</I>&gt;<i> an 'in memory connection', a mod_udp module could replace the TCP 
</I>&gt;<i> connections..  The core server still *supports* TCP, which it should, but 
</I>&gt;<i> adding UDP support is very possible using the modular architecture.  Refer to 
</I>&gt;<i> the source, luke.. ;-P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Then we can move on to optimization. As temas pointed out,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Jabber is just a protocol. If you want to run it over UDP, give it a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; shot. Hell, if you want to run it over Appletalk, give it a shot :).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey, look at this! The same thought...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   No one said jabber shouldn't have UDP support.  The argument has been over 
</I>&gt;<i> *WHY* use UDP.  I'm CERTAIN that UDP support wouldn't be procluded from the 
</I>&gt;<i> distrobution if someone wrote it.  The developers speaking against UDP don't 
</I>&gt;<i> happen to *AGREE*, but that ceratinly doesn't mean it can't/won't be done.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> simply means thehy do not see the value, and aren;t interested in it.  Many 
</I>&gt;<i> people working on Apache certainly aren;t interested in mod_perl, yet there it 
</I>&gt;<i> is..  ;-P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This is an open-source software project. Instead of blabbing on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; listserv, that we're stupid and wouldn't know how to make a &quot;hello
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; world&quot; program without your hand-holding, give us some code!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ooooooooooo! That was a little mean! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Problems have solutions...if you can remain open to them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   We're all on the same page here.  If not, hopefully we are now..  Every 
</I>&gt;<i> technology will have pro's and con's, and developers for and against.  This 
</I>&gt;<i> DOESN'T MEAN it won't/can't happen.  It simply means that perhaps that 
</I>&gt;<i> developer isn;t interested in working on it at the moment.
