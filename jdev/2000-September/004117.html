<PRE>Boy, this is good work Eliot and very useful. 

Once this article is done, I'd suggest that we powwow to talk about how we
might go about tackling this items. Perhaps this warrants our next
JabberFest? Not sure, but, seems to me to be a good set of agenda items to
rally around.

Subject: Jabber User Issues / State of the Bulb

Hey Guys..

After reading through numerous comments on JabberCentral's poll
regarding what should be improved in Jabber
(<A HREF="http://jabbercentral.com/polls/results.php?poll_id=962259052">http://jabbercentral.com/polls/results.php?poll_id=962259052</A>), I
decided to pull together the threads and make a &quot;State of the Bulb&quot;
article to post on Jabber.org. There's a lot of issues that we're
repeating ourselves over or answering in obscure places. I want to pull
together our answers (or point to answers) for these issues and let
people know what's going on. If you have some major questions you want
answered, or better, if you have answers to some of these issues, let me
know. I'm going to try and get this done by Friday.. but it may be early
next week. Here's my current list (be ware that I just scribbled these
down pretty quick.. I hope they make sense!):

- HTTP client status
- WinJab documentation (lack of), useability (it's meant to be
different)
- Why so many Gabber dependencies -&gt; point to Linux/UN*X alternatives
(Jarl, etc.)
- Why is there no powwow transport?
- SSL/pgp support in clients (and why SSL doesn't work end-to-end)
- aim transport: foreign characters, general stability
- how to use mod_filter to make icq messages come in as chat
- importing ICQ contact list (make tcharron's perl script available)
- wireless app (do php hooks exist to make this easier?)
- icq transport: groupchat, file transfer, stability
- console client (people wonder if any exist)
- JabberIM open source (will it ever be?)
- rss, jud (where are they?)
- transport unreliability (and why ICQ is not running on jabber.org
right now)
- *transport is server side* (remind people that clients don't have
transports, the server does)
- mozilla client (where is it?)
- server documentation / troubleshooting (will there ever be any more?)
