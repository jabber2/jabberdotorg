<PRE>Daniel,

I'm basing my knowlege on the W3C XML 1.0 Spec as published on the 10th
of Feb 1998.

The spec talks about an XML processor and only mentions parsers in
passing towards the end of the document. The last paragraph of the
introduction reads

&quot;A software module called an XML processor is used to read XML documents
and provide access to their content and structure. It is assumed that an
XML processor is doing its work on behalf of another module, called the
application. This specification describes the required behavior of an
XML processor in terms of how it must read XML data and the information
it must provide to the application.&quot;.

I can understand how you see the behaviour of my application as broken
if you are testing it against the specs requirements for an XML
processor, but I'm not claiming it's an XML processor, what I am
claiming is that it's a simplistic system which parses XML documents and
provides a mechanism to access purely the data content (i.e. tags and
character data).

The issue of case sensitivity on tags comes from the parsers original
use in system where the original data had be constructed in a case
insensitive way (I know this is against the spec, but it did happen in a
real world situation). I have uploaded the version of the parser which
can be forced to obey case sensitivity, but I have a couple of users who
prefer having the tags converted to lower case before they are passed to
the application (Again, I know this is against the spec, but as my
development work is paid for by donations I am not in a strong position
to say no).

I have had a couple of queries about support encodings other than ASCII
and UTF-8, but I have referred them to projects such as Xerces in order
to allow my parser to remain compact and simplistic. I rely on the user
correctly setting up the data encoding on their InputStream or Reader 
objects before passing it to my library to deal with other encodings.

I hope this helps you understand where I'm comming from.

Al.
