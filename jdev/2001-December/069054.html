  Right but the spec includes a lot of points that an XML parser MUST
respect to be considered to be conformant to XML. Your code clearly is not
and you should not advocate using it as an XML parser. Call it &quot;markup
parser&quot; if you want but not XML parser because this is not.

  Which is an absolute requirement for an XML parser. How many time did
you see messages on this list &quot;the server disconnect because I use
non ASCII characters&quot; like messages ? A server based on your parser would
not have the same behaviour as the common jabberd using expat.

</I>
It's just plain broken, sorry. The Jabber protocol is expected to be extensible
and the extensions are driven by XML (c.f. the XML-RPC, XHTML, ones etc...),
and all those are case sensitive because they are XML.

&gt;<i> Myself and others have used my parser in a number of products which

</I>
It happen to work, to some extent. Your parser though will not generate
the same output as something based on expat or another XML parser (seem you
miss the CR/LF normalization which mean you will not pass the same data
as a conformant parser for some multiline messages for example).

It's nothing personal, just one should respects the specifications when
they happen to exist and use conformant code/products when they
are available.

Daniel
