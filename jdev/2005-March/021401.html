I don't follow.  Existing client code is going to expect 'from' attributes on 
incoming stanzas.  This means that either 1) the clients have to be hacked to 
not care about 'from' attributes on incoming stanzas or 2) clients need to 
put 'from' attributes on the stanzas they send out.  #2 is not a thousand 
times harder than #1.

Supporting multiple users on a single machine might be a thousand times 
harder, but you're not forced to do that.  A single-user ad-hoc client should 
have no trouble interoperating.

</I>
Unless I've misunderstood how zeroconf works, I thought that you'd announce a 
single service regardless of whether or not the service was single-user or 
multiple-user.  Yes, this probably means that for multiple-users you'd need 
an ad-hoc Jabber client daemon.  No, I'm not saying anyone has to implement 
it that way.
