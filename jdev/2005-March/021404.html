What &quot;Jabber connection&quot; are you talking about?

I don't mean to be presumptuous or rude, but I really don't think  
you've thought through DNS-SD and how peer-to-peer Jabber would work  
with it nearly enough...

There's a local subnet. It has 50 users on it. How are you expecting  
that those 50 users will get one another's presence? DNS-SD means  
that we can treat the &quot;service&quot; as a presence packet (because really,  
it is advertising the availability of a service) and advertise our  
presence as a DNS-SD service. There's no need to open up 50 TCP  
connections and send &lt;presence/&gt; packets to all 50. It's all handled  
by Multicast DNS for us. There's no &quot;Jabber connection&quot; taking place  
until one user wants to send a message to another--then we're opening  
a TCP socket and sending a &lt;message&gt;.

I don't see why you need the 'from' attribute because you already  
know who the TCP socket connection is from and you already have their  
information from the DNS-SD service packet.
