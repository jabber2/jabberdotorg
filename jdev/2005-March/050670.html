Well, even without that, the service name is supposed to be the  
service you're advertising. The XMPP server is advertising an XMPP  
connection to which a client can connect, which from a server's point  
of view might be &quot;xmpp-client&quot;, yes, but from a client's point of  
view, it seems an odd thing to be looking for a &quot;client&quot; service when  
you want to connect to an XMPP Server.

Pedantry, I admit, but it had me confused for a few minutes.


For an official form of something like iChat Rendezvous, we'd need to  
define what exactly an XMPP client&lt;-&gt;client protocol should look  
like, which pieces of XMPP are disallowed, and when TCP connections  
should actually take place. All things which I was interested in  
doing back when it looked like something I'd be adding to Gabber one  
day, but which unfortunately I don't think I'll be implementing in  
anything anytime soon...
