That's a feature of the actual implementation, not the protocol used  
once the TCP connection is established. This is easy to add to  
existing client libraries.

Simple enough to add in place of the regular auth support.

Ok, this is pretty silly and makes the problem thousands of times  
harder. DNS-SD lends itself to be used as presence broadcasting, but  
then you /can't/ use it as presence broadcasting if there are  
multiple users connected without making /those/ packets insanely  
complicated too. I don't think that's a problem we should be focusing  
on at all, because I don't see how it's going to make anything  
simpler /or/ better.

I think that for now we should focus on things which DNS-SD has  
proven useful for. Multiple users advertising the same service on one  
computer is not one of them, and until the DNS-SD people have a good  
solution for that (if they care about it at all), I don't think we  
should.


I really think it shouldn't be that hard to take a random client  
library, hook it up to a DNS-SD and Multicast DNS library, change a  
couple of things, and have a working client. The hardest part should  
be gutting the presence implementation for use with DNS-SD.
