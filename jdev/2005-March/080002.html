JK&gt; There was a JEP to do &quot;Tree Transfer&quot;, but it was not well received,
JK&gt; mainly because it doesn't solve the bytestream reestablishment problem.

Hmm.. in fact there're a lot of transfer schemas where there's no need in a 
bytestream reestablishment. For example, the one used in the MSN P2P 
transfers, when each transfer has its own id, and every packet has a header 
with transfer ID, so any number of transfers can act in parallel on the same 
channel, either direct or via proxy.

So at least in theory there're no difficulties ;)

JK&gt; I created it as an extension and optimized it beyond what we had
JK&gt; originally discussed.  It is documented below as Fast Mode:
JK&gt; <A HREF="http://delta.affinix.com/specs/stream.html">http://delta.affinix.com/specs/stream.html</A>
JK&gt; Psi has been using this for over a year now without problems.

Thanks for the link, I'll read it.

JK&gt; The same URL above also describes a Multiplex mode, however it is just
JK&gt; an idea, I've never implemented it nor tried pushing it as a standard

Ok, I can easily implement the multi-send support as a sequence of single 
transfers, no problems. It would be ugly &amp; slow, but much better than 
nothing :)
