<PRE>Hmmm... I just looked through jep-0105 and it looks perfect to me. I
can see why they think it's overkill, but they're thinking along the
wrong lines. JEP 0105 gives you everything you need to transfer 1 or
more files in batch. Not only that but it also gives you the ability
to specify a hierarchy of files (ie. DOS directory structure.) Those
complaining about overkill shouldn't be complaining at all... rather,
they should use what they need and ignore the rest. After all, from
what I see, all you need to do to send a simple batch of multiple
files would be the following :

&lt;tree 
      xmlns='<A HREF="http://jabber.org/profile/si/profile/tree-transfer'">http://jabber.org/profile/si/profile/tree-transfer'</A>
      numfiles='9'
      size='80500'&gt;
      &lt;directory name='cd_collection'&gt;
          &lt;file sid='ft2' name='song1.mp3'/&gt;
          &lt;file sid='ft3' name='song2.mp3'/&gt;
          &lt;file sid='ft4' name='song3.mp3'/&gt;
          &lt;file sid='ft5' name='song4.mp3'/&gt;
      &lt;/directory&gt;
    &lt;/tree&gt;

Upon receiving this, the jabber client would then suggest (to the
recipient) saving it in a directory called &quot;cd_collection&quot;, and the
recipient can choose to do so or save it to another location of their
own choosing, similair to the way winzip works. I don't see any
overkill in this at all... the tree tag is there in order to hold the
number of files and total size, file tag is there to hold the sid and
file name. The only thing that could be considered &quot;overkill&quot; (to
those who don't care to implement it) would be the directory tag, but
the recipient can choose to ignore this easily, so I really don't see
the issue. I see that the status of this JEP is now deferred... does
this mean multiple file xfer support is now dead?? I for one would
like to see this JEP resurrected.... calling it overkill would be like
calling DOS overkill; sure, DOS has directory support *if* you wish to
use it. If not, don't use it!!

Or maybe I'm just failing to see the overkill, so if one of the
naysayers could explain to me why it's overkill I would appreciate it.
