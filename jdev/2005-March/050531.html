You can do two things.. modify an existing server to use  
store-and-forward, perhaps only under certain conditions (take a look at  
AMP, <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0079.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0079.html</A> ). Or you could write a  
component that delivers a message (if it's located on your own server, it  
could even spoof the from JID in most cases, take a look at the recent  
thread about that).

The latter idea would be more for when the user expclitly wants to use it  
to leave a message (I can imagine a client could try to deliver it the  
normal way, and when it gets an error offer to deliver it using that  
service). The advantage is it would (potentially) work on all jabber  
servers that support components, and people from other server could use it  
too (if you allow that, and without the spoofing ofcourse).
