<PRE>Okay, I figured out the problem.... it seems that in Java you can't
use an underlying stream when you're already using one of its
subclasses. In this instance, I created a buffered stream writer on my
outgoing socket stream and used it to do the socks handshake. After
the handshaking was done I needed to send the last reply packet
signifying everything was okay, but I did this using the regular
socket stream. It was choking on this part for some reason. When I
switched it to continue using the buffered output stream all worked
fine. I guess the morale of the story is that you can't use a stream
if it's already in use in on of your sublcassed stream writers. It
still doesn't answer why this worked with Psi and not with Exodus
though... strange.

Thanks for all your help.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 3) I send the iq containing the streamhost stanza with the host:port
</I>&gt;<i> 4) I accept the connection on the serversocket
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point the Exodus client is sending me a SOCKS5 version

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) I send 2 bytes in response, the first byte being the version (5) and the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point the Exodus client is sending me a socks5 request message

</I>&gt;<i> reserved : 0
</I>&gt;<i> type = 3
</I>&gt;<i> addr = host
