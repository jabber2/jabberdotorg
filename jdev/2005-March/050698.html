iChat basically already does Jabber without a Jabber server. It is  
not /technically/ Jabber because we define Jabber as having servers,  
but it is possible. We're not talking about involving a Jabber Server  
at all.

1) Client broadcasts presence using Multicast DNS and DNS-Service  
Discovery
2) All clients on local network receive these presence packets as  
defined by those protocols
3) when user wants to send a message to another user, open a TCP  
connection
4) send messages over that direct TCP client-to-client connection
5) TCP client-to-client connection terminated

Multicast DNS and DNS-SD are typically UDP, not TCP.

This is *NOT* currently a defined protocol in any way, shape, or  
form. iChat does something along these lines. We're currently talking  
about IF we were to define such a thing how it would be done.

Justin and I were arguing about what would happen at my step 4,  
except Justin's idea for how these steps happened seems to have been  
quite different from mine, which is why we both wasted so much time  
on it. :)
