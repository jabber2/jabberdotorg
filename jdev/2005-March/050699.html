<PRE>&quot;I SEE!!!&quot; said the blind man to the deaf man...

That seems like an interesting idea, though I think the current jabber
protocol doesn't allow for this (am I right?) UDP/Multicast chatting
is old-school, but I had never thought of using xmpp over it. I'm
curious though... under this system, Jabber ID's will no longer be
unique since 2 or more people can connect using the same JID. How
would this system prevent this from happening? Since there's no
authentication mechanism, how would it prevent someone from logging in
as someone else and pretending to be that person? Is this defined
somewhere? I would love to check it out in more detail...

cheers!

Anthony
