<PRE>Just to throw out a random guess here, but perhaps sending across the 
unbuffered stream caused the data to be split up, and Exodus was assuming 
that the response would be all in one piece?

Not that it's your software to fix, but it might be worth pursuing this with 
the Exodus guys just to be sure a bug isn't being glossed over.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; === repost from exodus newsgroup ===
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've written a simple java applet that implements the Jabber protocol in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very much the same way yahoo chat works. Right now things are going
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; smoothly, I can log in, do rostering, chatting, and bytestream file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfers. I have been testing so far against the PSI client, and I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to transfer files back and forth no problem. However, I seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having a problem with the Exodus client. I am able to receive a file from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an Exodous client just fine (though I had to use the latest development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; build 0.9.0.39; 0.9.0.0 resulted in a corrupted file), but for some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason I can't seem to send a file to Exodus, it gives me the error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Exodus was unable to connect to any file transfer proxies or the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sender.&quot; This is what happens :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) I do the usual stream initiation stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) I create a server socket on host:port
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) I send the iq containing the streamhost stanza with the host:port
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) I accept the connection on the serversocket
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At this point the Exodus client is sending me a SOCKS5 version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; identifier/method selection message, stating that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supports &quot;no authentication&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) I send 2 bytes in response, the first byte being the version (5) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the second being &quot;no authentication&quot; (0).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At this point the Exodus client is sending me a socks5 request message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; containing :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version 5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cmd 1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type 3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; host = SHA1 hash
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; port 0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So far so good!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6) hash matches great, so I send the Exodus client a reply message with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; status = 0 meaning we're good to go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is at this point that I believe I have nothing left to do but wait for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an iq response from the exodus client, but instead it immediately pops up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an error message stating that it was unable to connect. How can that be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when everything seemed to be going so well?? Is Exodus expecting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something else? Or maybe I should be setting the other fields in my reply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; besides setting the status field to 0?? I tried filling in the reply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message fields with :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version : 5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reply (status) : 0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reserved : 0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type = 3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addr = host
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; port = port
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and this doesn't work either. What am I doing wrong?? What's weird is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I can transfer files both ways against a PSI client, and PSI and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Exodus work fine against each other as well, but it's only when I try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; send a file to Exodus that I have this problem. Heeeeeeeeelp!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you for your time!! :)
