<PRE>Damn Justin, don't you ever sleep??? :P

I don't think it was split up because I was flushing the output at the
correct stages. Just to give you an idea :

*** DID NOT WORK WITH EXODUS ***
// note : ft.out is regular output socket stream, ft.in is input
BufferedOutputStream bout = new BufferedOutputStream(ft.out);

// send version (5) and no-authentication (0) to client
bout.write(5);
bout.write(0);
bout.flush();
					
// read socks5 message from client (contains SHA1 host address and port 0)
JSocks5Message m = new JSocks5Message(ft.in);

// check SHA1 hash, make sure all is in order.
// ... &lt;snip&gt;
// looks good, so we proceed

// send response message (status = 0)  to client indicating that all
is good to go
m = new JSocks5Message(5, 0, 0, 3, ft.host, ft.port);

m.write(ft.out); &lt;--- writing to regular socket stream rather than through bout
*************************************************

When I changed the last line to :

m.write(bout)

all worked well. Weeeeeeeeeeeird... but I'm not one to look a gift
horse in the mouth.

To track this sucker down I had to download exodus and all of the
necessary components (including Indy, Jedit Code Library, etc...) and
trace through, though I was unable to trace through the socket code
for some reason. After some experimenting with the type of data I was
sending and seeing the error message that popped back, I was finally
able to determine that the problem was with my code, and it turned out
to be what I just finished posting. During the process I discovered a
bug in the Indy socks library version 10 where it's shaving off a byte
in the host address of the request packet... I'll have to report it to
them. As for why it worked with Psi and not Exodus is still a mystery,
but I'm sure glad that my client's file xfer problems are over.

cul8r allig8rs!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outgoing socket stream and used it to do the socks handshake. After
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the handshaking was done I needed to send the last reply packet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signifying everything was okay, but I did this using the regular

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; === repost from exodus newsgroup ===
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I've written a simple java applet that implements the Jabber protocol in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; very much the same way yahoo chat works. Right now things are going
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; smoothly, I can log in, do rostering, chatting, and bytestream file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; transfers. I have been testing so far against the PSI client, and I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; able to transfer files back and forth no problem. However, I seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; having a problem with the Exodus client. I am able to receive a file from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; an Exodous client just fine (though I had to use the latest development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; build 0.9.0.39; 0.9.0.0 resulted in a corrupted file), but for some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reason I can't seem to send a file to Exodus, it gives me the error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;Exodus was unable to connect to any file transfer proxies or the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sender.&quot; This is what happens :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1) I do the usual stream initiation stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2) I create a server socket on host:port
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3) I send the iq containing the streamhost stanza with the host:port
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 4) I accept the connection on the serversocket
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; At this point the Exodus client is sending me a SOCKS5 version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; identifier/method selection message, stating that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; supports &quot;no authentication&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 5) I send 2 bytes in response, the first byte being the version (5) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the second being &quot;no authentication&quot; (0).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; At this point the Exodus client is sending me a socks5 request message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; containing :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; version 5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; cmd 1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; type 3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; host = SHA1 hash
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; port 0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So far so good!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 6) hash matches great, so I send the Exodus client a reply message with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; status = 0 meaning we're good to go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It is at this point that I believe I have nothing left to do but wait for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; an iq response from the exodus client, but instead it immediately pops up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; an error message stating that it was unable to connect. How can that be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; when everything seemed to be going so well?? Is Exodus expecting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something else? Or maybe I should be setting the other fields in my reply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; besides setting the status field to 0?? I tried filling in the reply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; message fields with :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; version : 5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reply (status) : 0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reserved : 0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; type = 3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; addr = host
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; port = port
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and this doesn't work either. What am I doing wrong?? What's weird is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that I can transfer files both ways against a PSI client, and PSI and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Exodus work fine against each other as well, but it's only when I try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; send a file to Exodus that I have this problem. Heeeeeeeeelp!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thank you for your time!! :)
