<PRE>Hi,

We have been working on a new XEP proposal which aims to solve the
following fundermental problem: How to find a JID given some personal
information about the person who owns that JID. Jabber users who've just
created their accounts, need to populate their roster with the people they
are usually in contact with, with as little manual process as possible.

The proposal is similar to what the BlackBerry does with their PIN or
WhatsApp with phone numbers. However, our proposal's approach is different
because it is more decentralized and general. By making it so, realiability
is increased by not having a single-point-of-failure and it also allows for
a greater pool of directories.

On the other hand, in spite of its benefits, a decentralized approach
proves to be most challenging in terms of sercurity, privacy, trust,
database maintance and scability.

We have written a rough draft[1] and we seek suggestions of how to tackle
those problems.

This is highly experimental work, so nothing is set on stone yet. We would
like to encourage everyone to send us their suggestions about how things
should or shouldn't be done.

Cheers,
Jef &amp; Tobi
