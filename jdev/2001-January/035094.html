<PRE>Please include me in these discussions.  I have been thinking about this
also.

The key consideration is that peer-to-peer is great when you can get it.
Many users are behind firewalls, NAT devices, and other obstructions that
prevent them from supporting incoming peering.  Whatever p2p features we
create should be usable through the server also (if the particular servers
involved support it) and supportable when only one party can support
incoming connections.

Another key part of this is supporting intelligent communication between
multiple applications on the same or different devices that 'represent' and
are being controlled by the same person.  I'm working on a plan for that
also.  This is, to some degree I haven't determined yet, like being a
message broker.  We might even want to integrate other message brokers in a
clean way.

We need to keep in mind the wide variety of applications that could use this
kind of ability and determine a neutral but flexible set of features that
things can be built on.

One to many and many to many are usually best handled by a server or proxy
of some kind, but there are exceptions to this.

Ideally the protocol used for this would be identical to the main Jabber
protocol.
