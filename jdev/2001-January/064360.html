<PRE>This is a post that was just in the discussion room. 

[18:18] &lt;mass&gt; quiet? quite
[18:19] &lt;twofriedeggs&gt; you mean no-one's complaining
about a transport being down? yikes!
[18:19] &lt;twofriedeggs&gt; :-)
[18:19] &lt;mass&gt; twofriedeggs: we figured out how to
solve that problem. Groupchat now filters out those
messages ;-)
[18:20] &lt;mickey2&gt; I take it you all do not want to
hear that then? better to just pat yourselves on the
back and think all is well
[18:20] &lt;twofriedeggs&gt; then that'd explain the
quietness ;)
[18:21] &lt;mickey2&gt; evidently your interest is not in
things working, just the illusion, so enjoy your
illusion then
[18:21] %% mickey2 has left


Now I put this here so all would know, why I am
stating what I am stating.
I have watched and mostly listening in the room for
awhile now. Waiting for things to line out and 1.4 to
get online and transports working. Many have also and
as it seemed that the time was approaching that this
might happen, I am I am sure others, have been excited
about it. I am NOT a developer, what I am is ONE of
the end users that I THOUGHT, was the purpose of
Jabber, or at least one of the purposes. For the
masses to use your IM clients. I now find that perhaps
is NOT the case.
I did not realize that my letting the people in the
know, know that transports were not working correctly,
was a problem and they did not wish to know these
things. I do now understand and stand corrected.
Jabber is not meant,perhaps for those like me, just
for those who develop it. I was misinformed. So for
those of you out there who thought you were in some
small way helping, DON'T it is neither appreciated nor
wanted as you can see by the post.
No worries, I will NOT bother you again. 
Understand, I do not think all the developers are this
way, but then I didn't think they thought that way at
all, so who knows. I do know that for me, I will go
back to another program, and not bother those who are
working so hard at making sure that all looks good,
Perhaps one day, it might, but then perhaps it is the
last thing I seen stated
. [18:26] * mass prefers to use his illusion
Kinda speaks for itself doesn't it.
For you end users, perhaps OMNI would be a good
choice, it will do the yahoo icq msn and aol, not like
jabber will, but then perhaps jabber wasn't meant to
work, just look good and impress some.
