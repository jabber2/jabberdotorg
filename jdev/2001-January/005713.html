<PRE>Hi Micheal;

    I haven't worked on the Jabber server , and can't adequately address
most of your points. I'm sure a member of the server team can give you a
more thurough run-down.

It sounds like you guys have done some interesting work in developing
the proxy you mention. Is there any chance of you releasing the code
surrounding these solutions ?

* access control
* session stats
* faux http encapsulation
* clustering !!

</I>&gt;<i> * No concept of access control or virtual severs. Fixed these by

</I>&gt;<i>   domains in the proxy (including presence information and
</I>&gt;<i>   per-domain connection quotas).
</I>&gt;<i> * Lack of broadcast/multicast message support (other than
</I>&gt;<i>   groupchat, which is overkill). Fixed by implementing in proxy
</I>&gt;<i>   (also put in a management console that allows most of the same
</I>&gt;<i>   operations as IRC network operator privilidges).
</I>&gt;<i> * Lack of session statistics reporting and conversation content
</I>&gt;<i>   capture. Implemented in proxy (user-specific logging levels)
</I>&gt;<i>   with optional per-domain connection quotas; the data goes into
</I>&gt;<i>   MySQL (which also holds applet config details for each domain)
</I>&gt;<i>   and is viewed by a HTML/PHP reporting and management interface.
</I>&gt;<i> * Lack of any kind of clustering/high availability. Solution; run
</I>&gt;<i>   two Jabber servers and mirror the spool directories with a
</I>&gt;<i>   replication script. Run three proxy servers with cluster
</I>&gt;<i>   synchronisation and use high-availability code to load-balance
</I>&gt;<i>   connections across the two Jabber servers (and stop using one
</I>&gt;<i>   that goes down).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the client side we're using a skinnable applet with a
</I>&gt;<i> definable level of functionality which defaults to sending
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber XML over port 80 (port-translated by the switches to the
</I>&gt;<i> proxies, filtered then forwarded to Jabber). Since some of our
</I>&gt;<i> users are sitting behind firewalls that don't allow anything
</I>&gt;<i> through except email and valid HTTP, there's also a secondary
</I>&gt;<i> mode that encapsulates all upbound messages in a fake HTTP post
</I>&gt;<i> request; this allows the applet to work from anywhere that can
</I>&gt;<i> can see the world wide web. This was somewhat complicated by the
</I>&gt;<i> fact that the proxies are behind load balancing switches; since
</I>&gt;<i> the main HTTP download connection and the HTTP message posts may
</I>&gt;<i> be routed to different servers they have to be identified and
</I>&gt;<i> sent over the peer connections (if neccessary) before being
</I>&gt;<i> amalgamated and sent to Jabber.
