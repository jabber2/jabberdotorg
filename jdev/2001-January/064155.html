Log into transport sends a presence directly to aim-t, as it should be
doing. aim-t, however, does not remember your buddy list and gets it
when you first log in and send a presence. Supposedly, sending a
&lt;presence/&gt; will make the server re-send presence to everyone so aim-t
can rebuild the buddy list. In practice, however, the server does not do
this. The only time the server sends presence to everyone, including
offline users, is when you first log in. Even if you send just
&lt;presence/&gt; - you can try it with Help -&gt; Debug -&gt; Raw XML Input - it
won't work as temas says.

The result: brandon is hacking gabber to solve this with a cheap hack.
Gabber will look through the roster and find all users on that transport
and send specific presence to each of them. This increases the amount of
refreshes in the roster and stuff like that... but talking to jer, it
doesn't seem there's another way other than fixing aim-t.

</I>
Gabber CVS has been hacked in a similar fashion as was described above
to make all users of the transport appear offline when a transport goes
offline. Yeah, it's a hack.

Yes, I am :)
