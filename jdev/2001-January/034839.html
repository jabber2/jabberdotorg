There's a couple of things I am going to try to see which part of Jabber is 
the culprit, but come on Jabber, I know you are all busy developing, don't 
really like to get distracted by questions on the list, but it is not like we 
are asking how to compile some vague transport or how to set up Jabber to 
walk our dog. 

This appears to be a real big dirty bug in jabber, and (unless both David and 
me are doing something fundamentally wrong and suffer from foot-in-mouth 
syndrome) I'd think this would be a definate showstopper bug.

The base_accept logic works wonderfully for service's, but not for xdb's.

Althought a patch would be nice, some thoughts about what is going wrong or 
some ideas to work around it would be very very helpful.

All the best,
Dennis

PS - Please don't take this the wrong way. We really appreciate all your 
efforts, and I'm happy to take things as-is, read the code for documentation 
and use the list for questions, doing lots of log analysis to find out what 
is really going on w.r.g the protocol, but this bug is *bad* and needs to be 
fixed.

Whatever I came up with with the different tests I'll post to the list.
