<PRE>You would advise me? No I think you have advised
enough, You pompous jerk, what happened, you mouth off
and finally someone says something to you and so now
it is a joke. Hey I am laughing at your last stupid
remark about advising me.
I am sure that was a joke too, and it was even funny.
Now we could go on for a long time going back and
forth over this, and I was actually regretting what I
had posted, because I felt I had stated harshly on the
others about your attitude.
For that I am sorry, for many in there do work hard I
am sure.
But then this post comes along and renews my sesne of
disgust in peoples ability to think insulting others
is funny.
Now I can rest easy knowing that I have been advised
