<PRE>Hi Folks,

   I'm a newbie to the Jabber world. While going through the 
Jabber architecture I realised that, for obvious advantages,
XML is being used for exchanging messages. I was curious to 
find out what mechanism is being used to translate the 
messages from one IM client format to another. I found mention 
of expat at quite a few places, hence the following queries :
- Is jabber just using simple SAX/DOM parsing for achieving the 
  translation requirements? 
- Even if the requirement was for a simple SAX parser, was  
  there any special reason to use expat over the other parsers 
  like Xerces?
- Did you consider using XSL for message translation? I may be 
  wrong here(I am not very much into XML) XSL seems like an 
  obvious choice, though the XSL transformation is a costly
  approach, but all the same it can give more felxibility as
  the parsing/translation is out of the code into the XSLs.
  
    I'll really appreciate if some of the gurus on the project can 
throw light on these queries.

thanks and regards
Deven
