<PRE>Howdy - I assume this is a jabberbeans question because of ConnectionBean :)

You cannot have two client sessions over a single socket with the Jabber protocol,
and that is also the reason why I made it possible to have multiple ConnectionBeans.

As far as the transports are concerned - I've always been a bit iffy on how the
server handles presence. As far as I can suspect, the server maintains a list of who
knows your online status within its in-memory copy of your roster (or some other data
structure). In the current system, you would probably need to send presence to each
entry in your roster in order to selectively pick who doesn't get to know you are
'available'. The transports use presence as the mechanism for logging you in
automatically.

This is a problem that definately needs to be solved for portable/bandwidth-limited
clients (so that people can be selectively authorized to see the existance of your
cellphone paging resource, for example) , so if anyone has proposals I'd love to
start hashing through ideas for a potential server extension :)
