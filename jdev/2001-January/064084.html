<PRE> Hi all,
 
 I've only just come across Jabber and am pleasently surprised !
 I generaly work on enterprise middleware systems where 
 flexibility can be very useful.

 From reading the docs I've found pieces like mod_filter, alternative
 transports, connection/disconnection etc., indeed many of the 
 components of a publish and subscribe system like JMS etc.
 ( please no JMS vrs X replies .. I know it's not exactly the same ).
 Has anyone used Jabber or considered it for publish and subscribe
 applications with each client potentially recieving up to 100 
 messages per second ?
 
 I suppose what I'm really interested in is 
 - Can mod_filter allow a client to block/allow messages based
   on arbitrary xml tags within the message body
 - Can clients talk to each other ? How ? I'd like, for example, 10 
   clients to take part in a &quot;local&quot; conversation rather than send 
   messages to the remote server. Essentially I'd like to avoid the 
   multiple WAN hops of one client broadcasting to a subset 
   of the others.
 - Can I store undelivered messages in a database ? I saw some details 
   but mostly related to an unsupported patch.
 - What happens if the jabberd dies ? Can I have a hot swappable 
   alternative or do I need to code that logic myself.
 
 The main reason I'd consider jabber would be that 
 - it's open
 - potentially, if client side conversations/chats, are possible without
   having to host a seperate server then I could potentially reduce the 
   traffic to client site dramatically. i.e. One delivery to the
conversation,
   not to each client.
 
 I know the above is a bit disjointed but I'm quite interested in hearing 
 what people have done so far, especially if many people have used 
 Jabber for in large middleware systems .... and all my christmasses 
 would come at once if you told me it just happened to be backend
 CORBA servers talking to remote clients on the customers site.

 thanks in advance and keep up the great work !
 
 Paul
