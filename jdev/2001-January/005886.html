<PRE>    I apologize that this is not a development posting.  I've been trying to
avoid sending this message, but I'm behind a firewall that won't let me talk
on jabber or IRC.  If anyone has any suggestions, please email me off of the
mailing list.

    I got some help from Peter Saint-Andre, but I still can't seem to get
the 1.2 server working right.  I have an dual processor Alpha running Redhat
Linux 7.0.  I downloaded the 1.2 source and compiled and installed it.  I
verified that I could connect to the server and talk between two clients.
But, then, as I was about to test, I noticed that I couldn't connect with my
clients.  It turned out, that I could connect, but only if I created a new
user each time.  I had closed the clients before my tesing.  The newly
created users have the same problem once they log off, they can no longer
reconnect.  I was also told that the agent for the user list was (JUD) was
unavailable.  None of this seemed related to the my trying to get groupchat
to work as I could remove my changes from jabber.xml to no effect.

    When I run in debug mode, jabberd just tells me that my usercount is 0.
Sometimes I see nothing in the error.log file and other times, I get some
error messages.  Here are (I hope) just the unique messages:

The .xml files in spool that it complains about, are there and are owned by
the user running the jabber daemon.  Thanks for any help or suggestions.

Cheers--
