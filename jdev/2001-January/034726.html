Also, in jabber.xml I have two agents with the same 'jid'. User directory
and Groupchat are both jid='penguin.neomeo.com' which is a locally
resolvable host name.
Is this allowed? Do all jids have to be different even if they are on the
same Jabber server and do they have to correspond to resolvable host names?
&lt;/snip&gt;

Otis,

Nope, that isn't allowed--you DO need each agent to have a different, fully
resolvable DNS name.  So you might want to change the &lt;agent id=&quot;&quot;&gt; for your
groupchat instance to something like groups.penguin.neomeo.com or anything
to make it different from your main jabberd host name.  You're getting &quot;not
found&quot; errors in your groupchat because the groupchat packets are being sent
to your main jabberd which doesn't know how to work them.  When you have a
separate id for your groupchat instance, those packets will be routed to the
jabberd that's forked specifically for group communication and things should
be working a lot better.  

Also, about your &lt;service id=&quot;&quot;&gt; question: 
&lt;snip&gt;
when you have &lt;service id='XYZ'.... Does the XYZ have to correspond to
anything? (e.g. a host name, or a defined jid or...?)
&lt;/snip&gt;

I'm not sure--on our jabber server, we've got &lt;service
id=&quot;groupchat_transport&quot;&gt; but I don't know if that has to refer to anything
specific, and there's nothing else in our jabber.xml that refers to
groupchat_transport.  Anyone else able to clarify this?
