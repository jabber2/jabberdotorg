<PRE>The closest thing to open source that I've been involved with
is the old Netrek game, so I don't have knowledge of what open
source processes work or not.

It would probably would be very useful to have an active dialog
take place on the protocol draft pages.  Perhaps taking place right 
on bottom of each the HTML page for each draft.  Something similar
to the comments section that appear on the bottom of articles on 
slashdot.  Further, it would be infinitely more useful if we 
could get an occasional response from the authors of those protocol 
drafts.

Hi, Robert. Yes, feedback is very much welcome. We are working on
developing a better process for gathering community feedback with regard
to the protocol. Right now the forum for discussion is this list, so
you're doing the right thing. :) Before too much longer we hope to
something a bit more formal, but right now this list (as well as the
jdev discussion room, <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jdev at conference.jabber.org</A>) are the places to hash
out the protocol.

Feedback on the process itself is also welcome. What kind of protocol
process would work well? What open-source projects do you think have
good feedback processes? We'd like to learn from other projects that are
doing things well, so your suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks!

Peter
