<PRE>Well I looked through the archives, during the night
and seen several more insults and remarks. I chose not
to respond to them until I considered everything.
Now I have, and will not respond to them. 
What I will do, is appolize, to the group for
unwarrented words from me.
Jabber is indeed a good project, and I am sure it will
go far, and many in the projects do indeed work hard
to make it all work. So in light of the fact that I
was willing to post in here what I did before, so must
I be willing to correct myself and my words.
I will not rehash what was said, both by me and
others, except to say on my part, it was a childish
act unworthy of an adult. So for that I am sorry.
No more post from me and Good luck on your project, I
do hope, when all is done that jabber ends up the way
you invision it to be.
