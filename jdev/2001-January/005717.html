</I>&gt;<i> * Server instability; the Jabber (1.2) server is fairly good as

</I>&gt;<i>   trivial to crash by sending arbitary XML. Solution; filter all

</I>
What is the XML you are sending it?  Have you tried CVS which will be 1.4 soon?

&gt;<i> * Broken character entities and non-ASCII character handling.
</I>&gt;<i>   Fixed by escaping everything in the proxy then fixing the broken
</I>&gt;<i>   characters that come back from Jabber.
</I>
Could you be more specific?  I believe all our handling is per XML standards
regarding CDATA and PCDATA sections.

&gt;<i> * No concept of access control or virtual severs. Fixed these by
</I>&gt;<i>   implementing fine-gained (ACL) access control and messaging
</I>&gt;<i>   domains in the proxy (including presence information and
</I>&gt;<i>   per-domain connection quotas).
</I>
ACL is scheduled to be in 1.4, I'm not sure how far along it is.  Virtual
Servers are already in and work fine.

&gt;<i> * Lack of broadcast/multicast message support (other than
</I>&gt;<i>   groupchat, which is overkill). Fixed by implementing in proxy
</I>&gt;<i>   (also put in a management console that allows most of the same
</I>&gt;<i>   operations as IRC network operator privilidges).
</I>
Could you be more specific for what you are looking for?

&gt;<i> * Lack of session statistics reporting and conversation content
</I>&gt;<i>   capture. Implemented in proxy (user-specific logging levels)
</I>&gt;<i>   with optional per-domain connection quotas; the data goes into
</I>&gt;<i>   MySQL (which also holds applet config details for each domain)
</I>&gt;<i>   and is viewed by a HTML/PHP reporting and management interface. 
</I>
There are some better statistics given by the 1.4 server, but more is always
better in some environments =)

&gt;<i> * Lack of any kind of clustering/high availability. Solution; run
</I>&gt;<i>   two Jabber servers and mirror the spool directories with a
</I>&gt;<i>   replication script. Run three proxy servers with cluster
</I>&gt;<i>   synchronisation and use high-availability code to load-balance
</I>&gt;<i>   connections across the two Jabber servers (and stop using one
</I>&gt;<i>   that goes down).
</I>
Have you played with jpolld at all?  This is a front end that handles TCP/IP
multiplexing into jabber.  I wrote it and can answer questions you have
surrounding it.  We used a jpolld setup to push a server to 100k users all 
active.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the client side we're using a skinnable applet with a
</I>&gt;<i> definable level of functionality which defaults to sending
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber XML over port 80 (port-translated by the switches to the
</I>&gt;<i> proxies, filtered then forwarded to Jabber). Since some of our
</I>&gt;<i> users are sitting behind firewalls that don't allow anything
</I>&gt;<i> through except email and valid HTTP, there's also a secondary
</I>&gt;<i> mode that encapsulates all upbound messages in a fake HTTP post
</I>&gt;<i> request; this allows the applet to work from anywhere that can
</I>&gt;<i> can see the world wide web. This was somewhat complicated by the
</I>&gt;<i> fact that the proxies are behind load balancing switches; since
</I>&gt;<i> the main HTTP download connection and the HTTP message posts may
</I>&gt;<i> be routed to different servers they have to be identified and
</I>&gt;<i> sent over the peer connections (if neccessary) before being
</I>&gt;<i> amalgamated and sent to Jabber.
