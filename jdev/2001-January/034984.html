<PRE>Posted on January 23, 2001 by <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jer at jabber.org</A>
The 1.4pre2 version of the server is now available. Read on for known issues
and a quick guide in helping test this version.

<A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.4/pre2/jabber-1.4pre2.tar.gz">http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.4/pre2/jabber-1.4pre2.tar.gz</A>

This pre-release is quite an improvement over the first one, so if you've
experienced any build or other issues with the first one, please try again.
We've tried to fix everything we know about, and running it @jabber.org for
the past week has helped shake out many of the major issues.

The platforms it's been tested on are Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris,
all with the normal dynamic build. We would love to know any other platforms
it runs on, or issues encountered with those platforms. If your platform
doesn't dupport dynamic loadable modules, this release now has a &quot;make
static&quot;, which will build a single static executable.

Please let us know if there are any problems running the server, or any
reproduceable crashes. We want to make sure the upcoming 1.4 release is as
stable as possible. Problems can be reported to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bugs at jabber.org</A>, and most of
the development team visit the jdev room on conference.jabber.org.

We're working on a nice 1.4 changelog for release, detailing all the
additions and any changes. We're also going to make available beta versions
of all the transports and have complete bundled packages and binaries of
everything available for the release. Unless there are any major issues, it
might even happen as soon as this weekend :)
Thanks for your help!
