<PRE>I wondered why you left the way you did.

I was joking. If you have *really* been paying attention to jdev, you
would see people like Eric Bowersox, Schuyler Heath, Keith Minkler and
Thomas Muldowney working *extremely* hard on these transports to get
them stable for 1.4. Schuyler in particular has taken over ICQ and
nearly overnight revamped it for the new architecture, and improved
stability tenfold.

We *know* the transports are not rock solid, and the above people in
particular are working very hard towards that goal.

If you are still on this list, I would advise you to direct accusations
about what I say to me, and not bash a bunch of very hard-working people
over what was a joke.

</I>&gt;<i> I have watched and mostly listening in the room for

</I>&gt;<i> is NOT the case.
</I>&gt;<i> I did not realize that my letting the people in the
</I>&gt;<i> know, know that transports were not working correctly,
</I>&gt;<i> was a problem and they did not wish to know these
</I>&gt;<i> things. I do now understand and stand corrected.
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber is not meant,perhaps for those like me, just
</I>&gt;<i> for those who develop it. I was misinformed. So for
</I>&gt;<i> those of you out there who thought you were in some

</I>&gt;<i> No worries, I will NOT bother you again.
</I>&gt;<i> Understand, I do not think all the developers are this

</I>&gt;<i> For you end users, perhaps OMNI would be a good
