Not exactly a first step since psyced has been doing it for a couple of years now, with increasing reliability. I wanted to let you know that the next step is also done and about to go on air:

There's an experimental gateway which connects to an IRC network as a server and gateways PRIVMSG between IRC and Jabber/PSYC. IRC users are given full addresses in the federation network and federation users are shown on IRC with a URL syntax. It currently only provides for 1-1 messaging, support for presence and entering channels is in progress. You need to apply some patches to the involved irc daemons, but the patches are pretty harmless.

In essence this software solution allows you to type '/msg xmpp:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at server.tld</A> hello' on all IRC networks willing to open up for this. ircnet users become available as xmpp:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">nick at ircnet.tld</A> to the XMPP network.
