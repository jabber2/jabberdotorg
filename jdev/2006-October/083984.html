I was talking about the connection between the XMPP gateway and the  
IRC server, there you have to use one connection per user (since you  
can't gateway multiple users over a single IRC client connection).

</I>
Oh, didn't know about that. Well, you could still implement this  
protocol for each IRC-server (at least for the open source ones or  
and ones with documentation), there aren't that many that are  
important (for the open source community, where XMPP is most common,  
the one freenode uses might be most important).

</I>
The solution I proposed would allow a smooth and clean transition  
from IRC to XMPP, which in my book would be preferable to the  
existing components. You have to get the IRC network admins to  
cooperate with you, though.
