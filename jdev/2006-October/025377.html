In general, mobile devices are well capable of handling a direct 
connection to XMPP. There are, however, gotchas.

Mobile networks almost exclusively have NAT boxes which have short 
timeouts on established, but inactive, connections. This is a pain, 
because it's often on the order of 5 minutes or so, and not only 
that, but it's worse for non-HTTP connections according to at least 
one study. The latter I recall coming up at the Lemonade London 
Interim about a year ago - one of the networks doubted the study, but 
it turned out that his was actually one of the included examples of 
this... So basically, even supposedly highly placed technical folk 
within the networks actually don't know how bad it really is.

This is a double-pain because in fact, TCP was designed to keep the 
connection alive without any traffic, and even throughout a 
lower-layer failure. Hence you get to unplug your ethernet cable and 
shift your laptop, maintaining your connection all the while. Badly 
designed NAT boxes break this feature, supposedly in the name of 
scalability - actually a live TCP connection that's not sending 
anything takes up very little resources on a NAT box. You can look at 
the Linux implementation for details of roughly what demands NAT can 
have.

So basically, a mobile device has to generate some activity over the 
connection for it to remain live. It doesn't have to be two-way, 
however - sending a space character is fine for keeping alive the 
NAT, it doesn't matter whether the server sends data or the client, 
either, so you have to have some timer somewhere that says &quot;Hey, 
nothing's happened for three minutes or so, I'd best send something&quot;. 
Which the networks then charge you for. Yes, they're charging you for 
their own flawed deployment. Nice, eh?

However, given that you'll be wanting to probe for new messages more 
often than every five minutes, and given that sending a small TCP 
packet is a lot less expensive (in terms on monetary cost *and* 
battery) than sending a full HTTP request, you still ought to be 
using XMPP over TCP wherever possible.

Circumstances where this might not be possible include some phone's 
APIs, which don't include a full TCP/IP API, instead restricting you 
to just HTTP, or if the device itself is restricted to WAP. (Also, if 
you're writing for set-top boxes which tunnel HTTP over MPEG, as 
bizarre as that sounds.)

In general, though, if you can write a usable XMPP-IM client, you can 
probably write it to use XMPP/TCP - the devices which are physically 
capable of presenting a usable interface also tend to have good 
enough APIs. 
Hope this helps,

Dave.
