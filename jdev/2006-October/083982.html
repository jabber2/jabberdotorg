Hi,

This is something I've always thought about. Using an IRC gateway for  
interconnecting between IRC and XMPP (which is the common way to do  
it right now) is pretty lame, since you need one connection per user  
on the XMPP side, which doesn't scale at all.

IRC supports server clusters, for example, freenode consists of 18  
servers (plus/minus a few), which are all interconnected, and you  
don't notice what server you're using (unless it crashes of course).
What if you would just write an IRC server that connects to this  
cluster, and instead of offering IRC to the user, offers an MUC  
service? You would only need a single connection to the IRC servers,  
and the XMPP protocol users wouldn't be second class.
Your server is the first step into this direction, which is great!
