&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have an XMPP-enabled web application. In that I have several screens
</I>&gt;<i> where a user may see a list of names of several other users. I would
</I>&gt;<i> like that user to be able to see, in near-real time, basic presence
</I>&gt;<i> information for all of those names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now I've implemented that by sending presence subscriptions to
</I>&gt;<i> all the names on the list minus those that are already on the current
</I>&gt;<i> user's roster. Then I've configured my client on the other end to
</I>&gt;<i> automatically and silently accept all presence subscriptions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This works, but it seems a bit heavy-handed. In particular, it means
</I>&gt;<i> that the user will continue to get presence updates for everyone whose
</I>&gt;<i> name has ever popped up on one of these screens, whereas I only really
</I>&gt;<i> care about the screen they're on right now, which will typically have
</I>&gt;<i> no more than, say, 30 or so names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One idea I had was to keep the approach I have but periodically drop
</I>&gt;<i> contacts from the roster who haven't been accessed in a while. But
</I>&gt;<i> that data isn't there anywhere in the roster-related information that
</I>&gt;<i> I can see (I use ejabberd). So I'd have to modify the server to
</I>&gt;<i> incorporate that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this seem like a crazy idea? How else might I approach this problem?
</I>
Create a MUC room for every screen and join / leave it as appropriate. 
Then display the room roster in place of the users roster you currently 
have. Much easier :-)
