<PRE>Hi,

We have released a new version of the Loudmouth XMPP library: 1.5.1

The upstream Loudmouth repository has not been updated for a while, and since
our repository is the only one getting some updates, we have been requested
several times to make real releases.

Mikael Hallendal (from the Loudmouth team) agreed [*], so here is the first
release by the mcabber community.
  *: <A HREF="https://github.com/mcabber/loudmouth/issues/13">https://github.com/mcabber/loudmouth/issues/13</A>

Loudmouth is a small C library for writing Jabber clients written using
GLib. It's designed to be extensible while maintaining ease of use.

There have been many changes since the previous official release (1.4.3
was published 7 years ago and 1.5.0 was released by Engine Yard in early 2009
but wasn't uploaded to GNOME's FTP servers and never made it into the main
distributions).

Here is a very very short list of the main changes since 1.5.0:

- This Loudmouth release is compatible with current Glib/GTK libraries
- The internal asyncns copy has been removed
- The security has been improved in several ways:
  - Certificates: added checking of SAN(s) when CN does not match and fixed CN
    wildcard handling
  - SSL 2 and 3 have been deactivated; TLS 1.1 and 1.2 have been activated
  - Use the default cipher suite of GnuTLS
  - New API: Implementation of lm_ssl_set_ca and lm_ssl_set_cipher_list
    This enables the application to choose additional CA certificates to trust
    as well as the cipher suites which are used by OpenSSL or GnuTLS
- Many resolver and parser issues have been fixed

Also, a Lua interface for Loudmouth has been written and is
available at <A HREF="http://www.isbear.org.ua/docs/lua-lm/index/">http://www.isbear.org.ua/docs/lua-lm/index/</A>


The release traball is available at
 <A HREF="https://mcabber.com/files/loudmouth/loudmouth-1.5.1.tar.bz2">https://mcabber.com/files/loudmouth/loudmouth-1.5.1.tar.bz2</A>
