&gt;<i> Noting that I'm an expert in neither of these things - APNS is largely
</I>&gt;<i> going to be sending notifications to the user, which is unlikely to be
</I>&gt;<i> useful in a machine&lt;&gt;machine client. GCM seems to be duplicating some
</I>&gt;<i> of the functionality you'd get from the XMPP channel.
</I>
True.

&gt;<i> It's worth noting that using load testing tools on XMPP servers (at
</I>&gt;<i> least the higher performance ones) almost always leads to performance
</I>&gt;<i> testing of the load testing tools, rather than the server itself, as
</I>&gt;<i> the server will typically process the data faster than the tool will
</I>&gt;<i> send it.
</I>
Yes, that's my experience as well ;) What tsung provides is that you can relatively easily use multiple machines to do the load testing together which might lead to actually load testing the servers. 

&gt;<i> They're still useful, though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Message reliability is very important (as said previously). Also you'll need an XMPP library which is robust. There's e.g. asmack[3] for Android and e.g. XMPPFramework[4] for iOS.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There are more choices than just these (and these may not be the best choices).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could you please elaborate on this? As I was searching for libraries I couldn't find a lot more than those.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Being entirely partisan, I'd use Swiften on iOS. There's also a
</I>&gt;<i> Swiften branch for Android (for a C++ interface), and I expect Stroke
</I>&gt;<i> (Java) will support Android pretty soon. I'm sure there are other
</I>&gt;<i> possible libraries, too.
</I>
Interesting. Thanks for the hints.

&gt;<i> I'm encouraging people to do a bit of digging and see what the options
</I>&gt;<i> are, and not pick the first library/server/client/whatever that's
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned.
</I>
That's indeed important.
