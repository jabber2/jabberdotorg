<PRE>Just to clear up a couple of things.

All XMPP servers provide 'push' communication. Presence and message
stanzas are push-based, iq are polling.

&gt;&gt;<i> Guaranteed message delivery
</I>&gt;<i> This is one of the most important things for mobile (as you might know already). There's XEP-184[1] for this and you have to watch out that your server implements this in order to know that the server really received this message.
</I>&gt;<i> Besides this XEP there exist different implementations by some servers.
</I>
184 is client-to-client. XEP-0198 is the client-server one.

&gt;&gt;<i> Scalability
</I>&gt;<i> This entirely depends on the server and, more specifically on your use case. You might want to do load tests using e.g. Tsung[2].
</I>
Picking an arbitrary load testing tool is unlikely to result in useful
data. The best thing is to quickly knock together a tool that
simulates the type of traffic you'll be generating.

But yes, some XMPP servers scale well.

&gt;&gt;<i> Machine to Machine communication
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean with this? XMPP is a federated protocol, therefore S2S communication is builtin.
</I>
There's no problem writing non-human-driven XMPP clients. Just pick a
library and off you go. XMPP isn't a chat system at its core, it's a
way of routing snippets of data.

&gt;&gt;<i> Mobile friendly
</I>&gt;<i> XML is considered verbose. You can enable stream compression if the server supports it. On the last XMPP Summit they talked about XML-&gt;JSON translating which might help to reduce verbosity.
</I>
JSON/XML is pretty much a red herring here - to encode the same data
you're just switching &lt;&gt; for {}.

But XMPP stanzas aren't /that/ big before transmission, when you're
talking about working over phone networks. Yes, compression will help
with stanza size.

&gt;&gt;<i> always on
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what you mean with this, can you elaborate?
</I>
You can open a connection and leave it open. Yes, this is the model
XMPP uses (as opposed to HTTP, which uses many requests over time).

&gt;&gt;<i> Is XMPP good to build a Mobile app?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Message reliability is very important (as said previously). Also you'll need an XMPP library which is robust. There's e.g. asmack[3] for Android and e.g. XMPPFramework[4] for iOS.
</I>
There are more choices than just these (and these may not be the best choices).
