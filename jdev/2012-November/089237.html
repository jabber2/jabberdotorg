Every XMPP server I know of does this.

</I>
You said you wanted &quot;guaranteed delivery&quot;. This is like &quot;security&quot; --
it means different things to different people. You might want some
combination of XEP-0198 between client and server, and XEP-0184 end to
end from one client to another through the server. Get clear on your
requirements and consider what will really solve your problems.

</I>
Hearing things is not necessarily a good reason to choose an
implementation. What we're encouraging you to do is complete some real
research. For instance, what do you mean by &quot;scalability&quot;? Do you need
millions of concurrent sessions? Etc.

</I>
In fact rosters are not truly necessary. You can run some XMPP servers
without enabling the roster feature. However, in general rosters don't
decrease effectiveness (and effectiveness for what purpose?).

As to XML, the folks who designed AMQP thought that XML had to be
verbose so they designed a binary protocol. I have not seen direct
comparisons of AMQP vs. XMPP-with-compression. Also be aware that
there are two different and somewhat incompatible versions of AMQP:
the 0.9 branch and the 1.0 branch. If you're going to consider AMQP,
make sure you look into the community, interoperability, the ability
to use different libraries or switch your server implementation, etc.
