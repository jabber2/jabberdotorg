<PRE>Hi Matthew,

I wouldn't say it's not the standard behaviour of XMPP clients. In&#160;
fact the only client I can think of that will use real JIDs for&#160;
private messages in rooms is Pidgin (and, well, I think Adium too -&#160;
but they share a lot of code).&#160;
Ok (as mentioned in the other reply), I more or less tested only with Adium/Pidgin.



As a user I find this behaviour extremely irritating. People who are&#160;
not on my roster message me, I don't know their nick or what room they&#160;
came from, and if their server doesn't allow messages from&#160;
non-contacts I also can't reply back to them. I can't see their&#160;
presence, and I might not want to add a stranger to my roster just for&#160;
one chat.&#160;

I personally think if you start a message with a room occupant in the&#160;
UI, the protocol should do the same, converse with that occupant in&#160;
that room. If I have a chat open with someone already, I am generally&#160;
unlikely to open a second chat with them in a room we are both in&#160;
(unless I forgot about the first one perhaps). This approach is always&#160;
going to work, it is consistent from the user perspective (sometimes&#160;
JIDs are available, sometimes they are not...), and so on.&#160;
Yes, that&#8217;s exactly what I think as well. Adding a user to a roster only makes sense if you really like to stay in contact with her/him.&#160;

It&#8217;s even more important if you don&#8217;t have a fully-fledged client (like Candy). Because then people might not even know what a roster is (because they just want to chat).&#160;

- Michael
