<PRE>&gt;<i> Hey all...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just a quick note. I've looked over the existing structures and I must
</I>&gt;<i> confess that I feel it would be much cleaner to go ahead and implement the
</I>&gt;<i> new DOM (as opposed to simply adding-on to the xpt structure). However, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't expect anyone to believe me just because this is what I think. :)
</I>
Hmmm... ok :)  I would think there is enough there in the xpt struct to
handle most of the DOM wrapper functionality, but I'd be happily pleased
to be proved wrong.

&gt;<i> So, over the next week or so, my goal is to *attempt* a rewrite of some
</I>&gt;<i> major pieces of the /lib directory. I would like to implement the new DOM as
</I>&gt;<i> well as start the integration of the threading library (Jer, what's the name
</I>&gt;<i> of the lib again?).
</I>
The threading library is pth, at <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/pth.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/pth.html</A>

As soon as I can get caught up on some of the server-move work, I'll be
sending out a kind of general thread-integration proposal as far as how
I'd like to see threads working within the server and libraries.

&gt;<i> I *will not* be committing anything to CVS. I don't want to screw up
</I>&gt;<i> anything. :) Furthermore, changes on this scale would seriously break most
</I>&gt;<i> of the code.  I'm just going to try this and see if it'll work like I think
</I>&gt;<i> it will... :)
</I>
That's cool, CVS will be in shambles for a while here anyway :-)

Jer
