Problem is, charsets change every once in a while. For example,
ISO-Latin-8859-1 does not contain the euro symbol used for European
Union Monetary Union currency. For this purpose there is a new
character set (can't remember the iso code). This is probably gonna
happen every few years.

As to the argument about keeping client restrictions to a minimum, as
a swede, I'd say a program such as a jabber client is not working if I
cant use national swedish characters (mainly &#229;&#228;&#246;) when communicating
with other swedes. 

Anyway, you dont need to force the clients to understand charsets, but
the jaber message format must be able to convey which character set
the message is written in. Personally, I'd prefer if ALL messages were
marked with character set, even if it is &quot;the default one&quot;.

Sorry to jump on you like this. Most European countries have some
national characters not enclosed in us-ascii and it is frustrating
having those issues continually marginalised by US developers. I can
only imagine how the Japanese feel about it.

If there is anything I can do to help in the matter, please tell me.
