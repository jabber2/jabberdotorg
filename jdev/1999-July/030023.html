<PRE>&gt;<i> 	Anyone know the status of JabberBean? I've been trying to contact Michael
</I>&gt;<i> T. Nygard @charter.net about it with no success as yet.
</I>
There were a couple of people that emailed me a month or two ago saying
that they would be away during the summer for a few months, I'm not sure
but I think Michael might have been one of them... Hopefully he's still
around and will show up soon.

&gt;<i> 	I'm working with the library to the extent it is finished, and it is close
</I>&gt;<i> to finished. I would like to help, but if I'm going to complete it I should
</I>&gt;<i> talk to the designer first, or at least some people who've been through
</I>&gt;<i> it... there's no documentation of any kind to indicate where Michael was
</I>&gt;<i> heading.
</I>
I know there's a few individuals out there either wanting to work on Java
stuff or already playing around with it, maybe someone can jump in here
and help out?  Someday I'm going to have to start playing with Java :)
