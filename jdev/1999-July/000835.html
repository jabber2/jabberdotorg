&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, you dont need to force the clients to understand charsets, but

How do the client know the language of a message? &quot;Normal&quot; human usage
patterns would probably be to write most mesasges in their native
language and some in english. It seems to me that selecting language
on every other message will likely be too much of a hassle. Of course, it
would be possible for every user to enter preferred language in your
profile in the roster. Intelligent clients could guess that yuo write a
message to a person in his/her preferred language. That would reduce
the number of occasions of manual language selection, if not eliminate
it.

... or we could pipe the text through spell with varying dictionaries
and select the one that has least errors. ;)

All this is a client issue of course, and shouldn't bother the
protocol/DTD itself. Misuse is no reason not to do things right. Still
it will be an issue. Any suggestions?
