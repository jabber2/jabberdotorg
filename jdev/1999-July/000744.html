<PRE>How would you feel about using a standard set of icons
for things like users, groups, IMs across all graphical clients?  I'm
not suggesting they be required, but it
would a) make implementing a new client easier and b)
give Jabber a stronger identity for the non-programmer users.  I know
it's a client UI implementation issue and therefore out of the scope of
the Jabber specs but
like I said, it would just be a set of icons that implementors are free
to use if they so desire.

I don't know if AIM/YAHOO/ICQ would get their undergarments in a knot
about Jabber clients ripping
icons from their clients, but I personally don't think
those UIs are worth ripping off.  The Jabber team could come up with
better ones.

Another related issue is a logo.  Gnome = foot, Linux = penguin, BSD =
devil, Apache = feather - It's not just an issue for commercial
products to address.  What would a &quot;Jabber Now&quot; link button look like? 
ICQ's has that flower on it.  I think the other buddy lists have them
too.

Sorry if the marketing questions make you ill.  Now I need to go write
some code, repent for my sins.
