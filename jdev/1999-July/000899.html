<PRE>** WARNING: opinions are below, take them with a grain of salt. **

-- Congrads! --

  Congrads!!  This message will kick the July messages logs to the largest size since January, and, well, January doesn;t could becouse Jer flooded us with about 150k of docs to the list then..  ;-P

-- My Outlook on current status of the project.. --

  Things are begining to pick up after everyone took a mental break.  I can't speak for the rest of the team, but I can say that moving forward I think we are on the brink of having a full fledged slashdot story ready 1.0.  This is mainly do to the outgoing attitude of some of the newer members.  PLEASE keep up the good work.

-- The Win32 project --

  Jer, I'm going to ask you this now to make it simple.. ;-P  Now that we have some more windows developers, I would like to request there be a different CVS project for the Win32 client.  I want to disect the relience on the jabber lib directory, and all I'm currently reqally using anyway is xpt.c and jpair.c.  Once we have the team environment in place, I want to let everyone that signs up as part of the Win32 team crank out on this client..  Our primary user base, dislike it as many may, is, at least for non technical users, going to be based on the quality of the Windows Client.

  To everyone who has inquired an offered Win32 skills, please bear with us..  We really can't start going development crazy until Jer is done moving over to the new server, otherwise our code bases will be hell to try to merge together.

-- The Win32 Team --

  As it stands now, I will be stepping up as the Win32 development coordinator.  To be totally honest, I don't want to hold that title alone.  Eventually, as development continues, as if the rest of the team has no objections, I would like to see at least a second coordinator..

  My reasoning behind the above is simple..  EVERYONE on occasion has to drop of the face of the net for variouse reasons, be it work, mental health time, death, etc..  Having only one primary leader in the group is not a very smart idea..  I recently needed to do the above for a month and a half, and is one of the primary reasons why there was NO complete Win32 client for the 0.6 release..

-- The CharSet debate --

  I believe it was Lindsay Marshall who pointed out the following:

&gt;<i>First of all, From the XML spec <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210">http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210</A>
</I>&gt;<i>section 2.2 states:
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;All XML processors must accept the UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings of 10646;&quot;
</I>
  My opinion..  CASE CLOSED..  We're based on UTF-8/UTF-16 IMHO..  I'd forgotten that particular section of the w3 standard.  There ARE packages available that could convert, as I pointed out, but I say we point them at the client developers.  w3 says it's XML standard, let's no screw with it..  Perhaps we could have some transports that deviate from the rule, as that's the wonders of jabber, but the standard jabbertransport and etherx need to maintain XML compatibility, 'spec if we develope the JNX standard (More on that latter)..

  Now, I don't understand why they actually ALSO standadize passing encoding data with the initial XML tag, but I suppose it's for future expansion or accomidating non standard clients..

  I know there's more that I'm forgetting..
