<PRE>I would like to do some work on the AIM transport, so I have been looking
through the code to try and figure it all out. I don't have much &quot;real
development&quot; experience. Perl I can handle ok, but my C skills could use
some improvement. So I want to use this as a chance to get better, and to
help out a great project. 

So my main question is, is there anyone willing to answer any (probably
stupid) questions that I come up with about the jabber architecture? I
don't want to bother the list with what most would probably consider
trivial things. 

Also, Thomas Charron, do you think you could send me that perl transport?
I bet that would help me a lot, to see it in simplistic form and in
perl:). 

It looks like you are using the binary oscar version of AIM at the moment?
I would prefer to do it with the TOC version like Tik does. If that's ok
of course. 

Thanks,

Jeff
