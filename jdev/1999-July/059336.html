  Yep, totally agreed.  That's why the Win32 client does all of the fancy stuff like minimize to taskbar, and animated icons, etc..

  (I FINALLY HAVE my Visual C++ installed, and my laptop, so, starting tonight I can hopefully start back on the Win32 client)

&gt;<i>I don't know either...I would avoid risking it.  I think the only graphical

  Theyt already did..  Take a look at the GAIM projects home page..  AOL lawyers basically told them to remove ALL wording of Gnu Aol Instant Messanger, and can now merely say AIM compatible, had to remove all AOL logos and icons, etc..

&gt;<i>Yes, definitely...I'm trying to think though...what comes to mind when you
</I>&gt;<i>think of the word 'Jabber' (I think of a mouth kind of like the Rolling
</I>&gt;<i>Stones logo :)...but it needs to simultaneously be slick, non-tacky, and
</I>&gt;<i>classic looking all at once.  Any artists in the group?
</I>
  Niel, I'm forwarding this to you and Adam for the above comment..  For the rest to understand, Niel is the guy I was mentioning earlier that works for an ISP that is going to try to push Jabber for usage at tiac.net, which is now a part of PSINet, and also happen to be pretty darned good artists as well..
