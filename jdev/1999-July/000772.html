I'll work some rudimentary logos, etc up this week and and hopefully have
them scanned in next week.  Once that is done, I'll forward the results off
to you.
Once that is done, you can have the other devs vote on which ones are worth
re-working, rescanning, etc.  

Another idea, is Jabber could hold some sort of logo contest, where the winner
would get a mention in the jabber docs, or some such.  Some little token of
esteem.  Just an idea.  There are far better artists on the net than me.  The
way that I look at it, is that what ever is choosen, should be simple yet
aestheticly pleasing to look at.  And most importantly unique.  I'll see what
I can come up with.  Right now my brain is telling me to use the letters; JBR.
But once I am out of work I'm sure that I will come up with something more
artsey.  See you Friday!

</I>&gt;<i>  Niel, I'm forwarding this to you and Adam for the above comment..  For

for an ISP that is going to try to push Jabber for usage at tiac.net, which
is now a part of PSINet, and also happen to be pretty darned good artists
as well..
