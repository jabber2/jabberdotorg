&gt;<i> I think you misunderstood me. Replying to existing messages is easy:
</I>&gt;<i> the client should assume that you're answering in the same language as
</I>&gt;<i> the sender had in his message. However, every time you send a new
</I>&gt;<i> message, it's kind of dangerous to assume any language. I myself is a
</I>&gt;<i> typical example. I will probably write about half the messages in
</I>&gt;<i> swedish and half in english. This would mean that if the client used
</I>&gt;<i> the locale or some default value, it would be wrong about half the
</I>&gt;<i> time, and I would have to fiddle with some pesky &quot;select language&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> { drop down list | command line paramter } about half the time.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if the roster info contained the *user's* locale, my client
</I>&gt;<i> could guess on that and be right most of the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Come to think of it, this would help bots and the like too, in that
</I>&gt;<i> they could talk to people in their native language. It would
</I>&gt;<i> definitively be nice if the roster info included preferred language
</I>&gt;<i> and probably charset as well.
</I>
This sounds like a sensible suggestion. (However I still think that the
language attribute should be included elsewhere as well in case people
want to use it)

&gt;<i> I was refering to the business of *selecting* language for a message.
</I>&gt;<i> The protocol in itself should definitively have the feature.
</I>
Ah OK - my mistake.
