<PRE>I don't know who might be interested, but here's where I'm at on my rewrite
attempt of the JabberLib...

My goal with this re-write attempt is to create a simple, easy to use API
for reading/writing Jabber XML streams that will support multiple language
bindings and platforms. I'm trying to take an approach similiar to the GTK+
toolkit. It'd be neat to see a JabberLib that could have C, C++, Perl, etc
bindings. Ideally, using the JabberLib would require little or no knowledge
of the XML parser interface. Furthermore, by using the pth threading
library, it should be trivial to write Jabber servers that can deal with
multiple connections.

To accomplish this,  I've isolated two core ADTs (abstract-data types):
    1.) JStream (a.k.a JabberStream)
    2.) JElement (a.k.a JabberElement)

JStream is an ADT wrapped around a file descriptor that can read/write any
file of XML data and parse/de-parse the XML into a logical, hierarchial
representation in memory (JElement). It supports the following operations:
    1.) jstream_read: reads from the associated file descriptor and only
returns when a complete jelement has been built
    2.) jstream_write: write to the associated file descriptor a jelment
structure. Handle decomposition of the jelement into a XML stream
Both the read and write operations are blocking (using pth). This allows one
to create a multi-client capable server by simply assigning each client
connection a jstream in a pth thread. No more confusing select statements,
and it's pretty cross-platform since it's based on pth... :)

JElement is an ADT which represents a parsed Jabber XML stream. It's roughly
equivalent to w3c's spec for the XML DOM (with a few minor alterations). In
a sense, this ADT is a conglomeration of the xpt,jpair, and xptpool
structures currently in the lib directory.  The obvious question, of course,
is why not use the existing (xpt, jpair, etc) structures?  To begin with,
there is a fair amount of overlap between the different structures (in terms
of organization). Attributes can have siblings in the same way that tags
can. An attribute name/value pair is nearly equivalent to a tag's name/CDATA
pair. Furthermore, I don't *believe* (Jer, please correct me if I'm wrong)
that the xpt structure properly handles multiple CDATA sections within a tag
(see the example at the end of this email).  Finally, by specifying a
dedicated ADT (namely, JStream) that handles the generation of a DOM
representation of Jabber XML data, there is no reason to have two data
structures (xpt and xptpool) to individually represent a document and the
elements within a document -- especially when the document and the elements
which compose it share a nearly identical internal structure. I'll probably
need to clarify these reasons at a later point (especially as my brain is
nearing a fried point for this week). :) The bottom line is that I believe
that one, consistent data structure is much simpler to deal with than 3 data
structures. :) To those who feel inclined to disagree I respectfully point
out that this is patterned after the w3c DOM design, so if it's good enough
for them it's good enough for me. :)

More later.

-------------CDATA parsing example-------------
Consider the following:

&lt;message&gt;Hello world in a &lt;bold&gt;new&lt;/bold&gt; way!&lt;/message&gt;

This should parse out to:

TAG(name=message, children = [
    CDATA(value=&quot;Hello world in a&quot;),
    TAG(name=bold ...),
    CDATA(value=&quot;way!&quot;)
    ]
)

*not*:

TAG(name=message, children = [
    CDATA(value=&quot;Hello world in a way!&quot;)
    TAG(name=bold...)
    ]
)
