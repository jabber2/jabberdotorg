<PRE>I am just starting to work on the transport. I read in the archive someone
else who didn't like TOC much:). Now you. Why is this? I was planning on
using TOC rather than OSCAR. But if there is really some good reason why
OSCAR is better, maybe I should use that?

Thanks,
Jeff

I started to laugh histerically, and asked him where he'd seen it.  He happened accross it on a web search the other day.  Anyway, he is REALLY looking forward to looking at it, and here's the best part..  He wants to roll it out for usage by the ISP he works for, PSINet, once everything is up to snuff for a 1.0 release..  He's most likely going to join the list eventually, as he's really exited about the whole idea..
