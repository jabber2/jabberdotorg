<PRE>&gt;<i> 	1) Although cross-platformness is a great goal, pth 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't really
</I>&gt;<i> accomplish this.  (As your post shows.)
</I>
It's good at being cross-platform between UNIX-alikes...and, since it's
FSF-owned code, I don't know how eager they are for it to be used on NT :-)

&gt;<i> 	2) Pth takes over SIGUSR1 which is normally (?) used as 
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;reload
</I>&gt;<i> configuration files&quot; signal.
</I>
It's usually SIGHUP that's used for reloading configuration files...however,
SIGUSR1 frequently has other &quot;interesting&quot; uses that, yes, pth would
preclude.

&gt;<i> 	3) Pth doesn't play nice when it gets near other threading
</I>&gt;<i> systems.  This means that Jabber can not be linked with some
</I>&gt;<i> libraries.  This limits the usefulness of Jabber in some cases.  (ODBC
</I>&gt;<i> libraries are often linked with thread libraries.)
</I>
Actually, pth provides a pthreads-compatible call interface, it looks like,
so this might not be the issue you think it is.  However, I can't say for
sure.

&gt;<i> 	4) Pth isn't used by a lot of other projects, so it might have
</I>&gt;<i> hard to track down bugs.
</I>
A few of which we've already seen :-).

&gt;<i> 	It has only one nice thing:
</I>&gt;<i> 	Pth is cooperative threading.  Cooperative means that most race
</I>&gt;<i> conditions don't come up.  Switching to a non-cooperative thread model
</I>&gt;<i> would be a lot of work as races get stamped out.
</I>
True...you don't need things like mutexes as much in pth, although they're
provided.
