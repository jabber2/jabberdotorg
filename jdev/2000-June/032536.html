<PRE>Tell me, why isn't Jabber already written with a modular design?  Shouldn't there
be a thread module to provide and abstract interface to the thread library,
elimination all of this?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; doesn't really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; accomplish this.  (As your post shows.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's good at being cross-platform between UNIX-alikes...and, since it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FSF-owned code, I don't know how eager they are for it to be used on NT :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         An argument could be made that most platforms HAVE thread
</I>&gt;<i> libraries already.  And it could be said that POSIX threads are fairly
</I>&gt;<i> standard, and it could be said that wrapper libraries can be created for
</I>&gt;<i> platforms where POSIX threads are not available, or not the best
</I>&gt;<i> choice.  In fact, these wrappers have been written for a number of other
</I>&gt;<i> open source projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     2) Pth takes over SIGUSR1 which is normally (?) used as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a &quot;reload
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; configuration files&quot; signal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's usually SIGHUP that's used for reloading configuration files...however,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SIGUSR1 frequently has other &quot;interesting&quot; uses that, yes, pth would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preclude.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Good point.  I confused the signals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     3) Pth doesn't play nice when it gets near other threading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; systems.  This means that Jabber can not be linked with some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; libraries.  This limits the usefulness of Jabber in some cases.  (ODBC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; libraries are often linked with thread libraries.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually, pth provides a pthreads-compatible call interface, it looks like,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so this might not be the issue you think it is.  However, I can't say for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I looked this over.  The man page is interesting...   (7000+
</I>&gt;<i> lines!)  It looks like PORTING an application from pthreads to pth might
</I>&gt;<i> be an easy enough thing to do.  (Kind of.  It's hard to tell how well it
</I>&gt;<i> works without trying it.)  However, this doesn't help if you are dealing
</I>&gt;<i> with a library which you don't have the source to.  And some libraries you
</I>&gt;<i> might not want to convert, and others ...  well, I admit it helps, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's not a really GOOD solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     4) Pth isn't used by a lot of other projects, so it might have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hard to track down bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A few of which we've already seen :-).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     It has only one nice thing:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     Pth is cooperative threading.  Cooperative means that most race
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; conditions don't come up.  Switching to a non-cooperative thread model
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would be a lot of work as races get stamped out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True...you don't need things like mutexes as much in pth, although they're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provided.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Don't mind me.  I'm just upset because I'm trying to link in a
</I>&gt;<i> commonly threaded library into Jabber.  I'll get over it.
