<PRE>I was thinking the other day about a specific type of denial-of- 
service attack which may possibly affect a number of servers in  
active use today.

Imagine a c2s connection that has already been set up and is now  
moving top-level stanzas. What would happen if I sent

&lt;message to=&quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">randomjid at jabber.org</A>&quot;&gt;&lt;body&gt;

Followed by a stream of random UTF-8 characters? Assuming that those  
random characters do not happen to contain &lt;, &gt;, or &amp;, (which is  
pretty easy to ensure), I would imagine that the process which has  
the XML parser would get larger and larger until the process would  
run out of memory. Boom.

This attack (in spirit) doesn't require a fully established jabber  
stream, it only needs an opportunity to inject a large amount of data  
into an XML element that is inside of a top-level stanza. This attack  
could possibly work for attributes as well.

Limiting the size of a single stanza may or may not fix the problem,  
depending on implementation. If the stanza size filter is applied to  
the stanza after it has been parsed, then this isn't good enough--the  
attack will still be successful because the stanza will never finish  
parsing. However, if the parser kept track of how large the stanza  
was getting as it was parsing it, then this attack can be avoided.

Any thoughts, or other methods of preventing this attack from being  
successful? Or has this already been considered and &quot;fixed&quot;?
