Well, they certainly have separate certificates for https. For hosting
providers it's usually an up-sell to your customers to add security on
their http domains through a certificate purchased from an affiliate CA.
I could easily see XMPP following the same route and/or using the same
certificates.

As a hosting provider I'd want separate certificates for all of my
virtual domains so I could more easily provision domains on servers. I'd
also want wildcard or multi-domain certificates for XMPP, but that
wouldn't be necessary if, for example, S2S isn't enabled.
