<PRE>Perhaps, but it needs to be clarified that such a limit must be  
implemented in a very specific way. Current implementations of &quot;max  
stanza size&quot; will likely not prevent this attack from being  
successful because it is imposed after the stanza is parsed. This  
attack is targeted at the streaming XML parser.

As long as there is the ability to set a limit then this attack can  
be thwarted.

Such a limiting mechanism should be implemented at the transport  
level, not at the session or presentation layers as currently  
implemented in most XMPP servers.

While it would perhaps be a good idea to allow the server  
administrator the ability to disable this mechanism, I think that it  
should be enabled by default--perhaps set to 100k(an absurdly large  
size for a stanza).

All of these recommendations would be enumerated and described in the  
proposed best-practice JEP.
