<PRE>Thank you Sascha for your reply.
Let me describe my wish in more details :

- client would be running on Windows platform
- server on Linux (as I would use existing jabber server)

I wouldn't use POST-GET using PHP since I'm building this for larger amount
of users.

Also, I'm not coding a client in PHP, I'm doing it in C++ Builder.

I've chosen C++ Builder because of VCL, quicker development using existing
components.

There won't be any permissions security, like normal users and moderators,
just users.

Users which can communicate with each other using private messages, chatting
in public rooms or creating their own rooms with limit (number of users).

Since I've mentioned C++ Builder, are there any jabber libraries which can
help me implement it's protocol?

Or should I use simpler IM protocol for this task?

Thank you

</I>&gt;<i> but ask urself some questions..

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> iam flash/openlaszlo/AJAX developer... so more working on the web-based

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok i must say iam an xPath fan.. so i love XML 4 its nativity

</I>&gt;<i> client sided application installing and that with any kind of
</I>&gt;<i> protocoll... or i must use the flash communication server
</I>&gt;<i> if u are using C++ Delphi Kylix Java .... u could also implement those

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> however..
</I>&gt;<i> US-Gpverment is using and trusting Jabber also as many other Big

</I>&gt;<i> XMPP is easy to use and has a good mailinglist(JDEV)
</I>&gt;<i> for flash(macromedia) there are many other socket server i would ever
</I>&gt;<i> choose Jabber but if videoconferencing is needed i must wheter use the
</I>&gt;<i> FCS (very expensive) or switch my programming lang.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> btw i love to develop but as far i see no reason about:
</I>&gt;<i> securitylags
</I>&gt;<i> easyier way of usage and handling to the customer and my workflow
</I>&gt;<i> or rebuild commercial software as open source
</I>&gt;<i> ... i see no need for REcreating the wheel.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wish to implement IM feature in my application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would have following features:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - private messages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - chat rooms (also the ability for user to create chat room)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please, tell me, what do you guys (&amp; girls?) think it's the best do to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I'm I wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - better not to re-invent things and use existing open-source protocol
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - use jabber protocol and (jabber) server application as a server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - look at (jabber) client application and implement mentioned features
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in my application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Doesn't sound like much work, does it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you!
