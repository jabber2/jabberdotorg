I've implemented something much like this recently (past week, in fact, and 
still going) with a few minor differences.

1. External component uses pure subscription to add users.  That is, you add
   it to your roster and it Just Works (so it can work with clients that don't
   have a Service Discovery dialog.)

2. External component holds presence in-memory and exposes a DRuby interface.

3. Webapp asks the DRuby interface for the presence of a given user, and gets
   it directly.

I could probably transition to an SQL database if keeping the presences 
in-memory ever becomes a problem, but right now this is a pretty snappy way 
to find the presence of a user.

The only differences with doing this as a component instead of a client bot:

1. Components don't have a roster, so to send the presence of the component
   itself you have to send an individual presence packet to every subscribed
   user on startup, and when new users join.

2. The server doesn't send you the presence flood on login, so you have to
   send individual presence probes to every subscribed user on startup too,
   to prod the server into telling you their status.

3. Some clients which sort agents into a different group will nicely put the
   Web Presence component in the group with other transports.
