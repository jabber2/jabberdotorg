<PRE>Thanks to all for the answer/suggestions... What i have think now is to
automatize the process of exchanging keys using OpenPGP key servers,
after all they are suppossed to be synchronized, aren't they? Also i
will develop something to create the OpenPGP keypair (just in case the
user has not used PGP before...) 

Apart from that i have been thinking on reporting a comment to the
jabber people about this... I have developed a simple solution which
basically stores the public in the jabber server in a place accessible
for everyone but that only the user can write, i've been testing it and
looks nice, should i make a more formal document and report it to
jabber.org? 

Finally and considering that i will use OpenPGP to handle the
encryption, should i use GnuPG? I have been looking at the BouncyCastle
cryptography extension (a set of librearies to perform cryptographic
functions), by using that i may avoid using GnuPG, what do you think?

Thanks again :-) 
Moriano
