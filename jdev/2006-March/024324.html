Another variant:

open a tcp connection to an jabber server, and send a  
&lt;streeeeeeeeeam&gt; stanza, making sure you use a lot of 'e's.

Unless your XML parser has DoS detection and prevention, like over-x- 
bytes node names, attributes, value and data, you are vulnerable to  
these.

Best regards,
