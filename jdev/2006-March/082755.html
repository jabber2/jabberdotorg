</I>
This seems accurate to me. Personally, I have realized that I am more
interested in identity than anonymity:

<A HREF="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2006-02.html#2006-02-27T22:13">http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2006-02.html#2006-02-27T22:13</A>

Which is why the OpenPGP / X.509 approach has become more appealing to
me than the OTR approach.

But I also understand that something like OTR is valuable in certain
contexts. E.g., if I were a dissident in a repressive society, I sure as
hell would prefer OTR to OpenPGP/X.509. But I'm not a dissident in a
repressive society, I'm an individual in what I hope can remain an open
society, so I tend to prefer OpenPGP/X.509 these days. FWIW. :-)

&gt;<i> X.509 certificates are certainly too hard to obtain for most users,
</I>&gt;<i> mainly because they're worth practically nothing without the signature
</I>&gt;<i> from the CA (CAcert is of course available for no cost, but it still
</I>&gt;<i> takes time: time users can't be bothered to spend.)
</I>
Well, some people get X.509 certs as part of their organizational
identity, so for them certs are easy to obtain.

&gt;<i> With OpenPGP, creating the keys is easy, if not trivial.  Getting them
</I>&gt;<i> signed (and hence trusted) takes the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess you can blame a lot of that on the lack of a &quot;simple&quot; GUI for
</I>&gt;<i> signing keys (by &quot;simple&quot;, I refer not to KDE or GNOME simplicity, but
</I>&gt;<i> MacOS simplicity.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I often wonder if an instant messaging client might one day provide that

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    User: [initiates chat to a contact who has signed their presence]
</I>&gt;<i>    IM Client: &quot;Are you absolutely sure this person is the one you wish
</I>&gt;<i>                to talk to? [Yes/No/Ask me again later]&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    User: Yes
</I>&gt;<i>    IM Client: [signs the key with a relatively low, but good-enough
</I>&gt;<i>                trust value.]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Add a nice indicator next to your contacts who have untrusted keys, and
</I>&gt;<i> you have yourself an OpenPGP GUI which is almost as useful as the more
</I>&gt;<i> advanced alternatives.  It's not with &quot;The Spirit&quot; of OpenPGP where you
</I>&gt;<i> go and meet people in person, but it's certainly more realistic for the
</I>&gt;<i> ordinary user.

The buddy list as the center of your trust universe? I like it.
