<PRE>Returning an error to the new resource connection gives feed back to the
client. If the client does not allow the resource to be changed (as maybe
implemented by some ISP) this is equivalent to not allowing multiple
resources. Then the old resource is disconnected and replaced by the new
one.

Stating that &quot;the whole point of the resource identifier was to be able to
signify the location of the resource (home, work, mobile) rather than be a
random bunch of characters.&quot; is a somewhat restrictive interpretation. It
may be valid to a certain extend for an IM application. It is certainly not
the only possibility (see Google). In a non IM application, it may follow an
entirely different logic. Furthermore, assuming the resource can be globally
associated with a specific logic would in my opinion limit your application.
As a common rule, incompatibility between addressing schemes are often
linked to address holding logic outside the routing space...

But what if the client being used doesn't allow resource identifiers
to be changed?  I like being able to logoff the current existing
resource by logging in from a different location.  And the whole point
of the resource identifier was to be able to signify the location of
the resource (home, work, mobile) rather than be a random bunch of
characters.
