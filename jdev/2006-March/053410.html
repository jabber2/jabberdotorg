You can only have one common name in a certificate(I think). I don't see 
what the limit of subjectAltnames is in rfc3280 but you can do wildcards.

Managing 50k private keys would be nuts. Client support for traversing 
50k subjectAltNames would be questionable.

Obtaining an intermediate 
CA(<A HREF="http://www.geotrust.com/products/client_certificates/true_credentials.asp">http://www.geotrust.com/products/client_certificates/true_credentials.asp</A>) 
from someone like GeoTrust or getting a wildcard 
cert(<A HREF="http://www.geotrust.com/products/ssl_certificates/wildcards.asp">http://www.geotrust.com/products/ssl_certificates/wildcards.asp</A>) 
might help. They might want to contact CACert.

So I'm all for each domain having their own certificate. Also the 
revocation list might be annoying if you have all 50k domains in one 
cert and you have to add one domain one day and delete a domain the next 
day...
