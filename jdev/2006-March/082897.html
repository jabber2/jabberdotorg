Just count the network bytes before they go into your XML parser.

Iris uses a SAX parser, and I had a limiter that would just count all the 
network bytes put into it, and reset the bytes whenever a full event (e.g. 
stanza endElement) completed.  The connection could just be dropped if the 
limit were exceeded.

However, I ended up throwing this mechanism out, because from a client 
perspective it doesn't really help at all.  The problem is that you don't 
know what your Jabber server's stanza size limit is, and some servers may not 
even have a limit.  This means that even with a limit in your client, anyone 
can DoS you by just sending a stanza larger than your client limit but 
smaller than your server limit (easily done if your server has no limit), and 
your client would happily disconnect from your own server.  Oops!

I'd say until we get a size negotiation for c2s, this problem is not &quot;fixed&quot;.
