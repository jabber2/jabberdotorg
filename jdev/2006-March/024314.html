<PRE>I implemented this months ago, and it worked, but I never fully tested it 
with non-ASCII usernames and passwords. Now I'm running into a problem, 
and I don't know whether it's my fault.

The SASL Digest document (rfc2831) says, in section 2.1.2.1:

    The &quot;username-value&quot;, &quot;realm-value&quot; and &quot;passwd&quot; are encoded
    according to the value of the &quot;charset&quot; directive. If &quot;charset=UTF-8&quot;
    is present, and all the characters of either &quot;username-value&quot; or
    &quot;passwd&quot; are in the ISO 8859-1 character set, then it must be
    converted to ISO 8859-1 before being hashed.

If I follow this instruction, authentication doesn't work. (I mean, it 
doesn't work for usernames that contain characters in the 128-255 range. 
If everything fits in ASCII, the two encodings are identical and 
everything works. If there's a character beyond 255, the quoted 
instruction doesn't apply and everything still works.)

If I ignore the instruction (and never convert to 8859-1), then 
authentication works in all cases.

(I tested this against our own ejabberd server and against jabber.org.)

So, did I screw up the implementation somewhere? Is ejabberd behaving 
badly? Or should I be ignoring that line of the spec? (That would surely 
be the easy way out, since it leads to my code working.)
