Currently, everyone puts the domain of a server in the commonName.  And this 
is also consistent with RFC 3920's recommendation of using the HTTP methods 
to verify if a certificate in a c2s/s2s connection is valid.  Thus, it should 
be quite acceptable to put the value in three fields: commonName, dNSName, 
and xmppAddr otherName.

We should probably not put nodes into the commonName and dNSName fields.  
These fields should only be used if your JID is domain-only.  However, it is 
not clear if this is forbidden (maybe something to note in 3920bis?).

As I think about this some more, it seems to me that in a Jabberized world, 
the only field we'd care about is xmppAddr.  dNSName and commonName are 
really only there for compatibility with existing CAs and restrictive TLS 
implementations.

As I think about this even /more/, I wonder if we should allow fallback of 
JIDs with nodes into the rfc822Name field.  This may help with 
similarly-restrictive S/MIME implementations, as well as CAs.  I agree that 
putting the same information in two places is not a great idea, but there 
seems to be a standard practice of already doing it with domains, so I think 
it is worth considering for jid-&gt;email.

&gt;<i> &gt; Any other ideas? BTW: What means &quot;id-on-&quot; in id-on-xmppAddr? Why nt

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's ASN.1 madness, don't ask.
</I>
And just shorthand for documentation purposes.  The string is basically like a 
namespace, and the prefix helps give an idea of what it is for, which I think 
is Identity-OtherName (just a guess).  This namespace string doesn't appear 
in the Certificate anywhere, only the OID does, so there's no reason to get 
too hung up about it.
