&gt;<i> Have you read 'JEP-0116: Encrypted Sessions'
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0116.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0116.html</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> JEP-0027 is only a Historical JEP, so it's not a standards-track spec,
</I>&gt;<i> JEP-0116 is a standards-track spec.
</I>
True, the thing is that JEP-0116 is still experimental, and to be honest
the reason to add encryption is to learn something, it may not be useful
even, this : just for fun (although obviobsly that will result
implementing the JEP-0166 before or later). 

Apart from that i think there are still out there a lot of clients using
JEP-0027 and not JEP-0116...

Anyway (thanks for the advices of course :-) and reconsidering the key
exchange (which has raise my paranoia level), should y use GnuPG (gpg
and others...) ? The thing is that it is suppossed that GnuPG may be
used as a kind of &quot;engine&quot; for larger applications. However i do not
like the idea of have &quot;dependencies&quot; on my software, this is i would
prefer to avoid forcing the user to have GnuPG installed... (actually
the whole client is done in Java, so there is a BIG dependence
already). 

Any ideas? Using GnuPG to handle with the keys looks easy, but it is
adding dependencies, in the other hand i have been looking at the Bouncy
Castle library (www.bouncycastle.org) which is able to habndle with the
keys also, but i did not find a way to retrieve the keys from the
OpenPGP server (or to store them). 

Finally I would like to say Thanks again to all the people that answer
this thread (i started it), you are being VERY helpful (after all i'm a
newbie in the world of Jabber development...)
