True.

I think we need some experimental implementations of JEP-0116 to see if
it is feasible to implement or or too complicated for client developers.

Another approach, which Justin Karneges has mentioned before and which
I've chatted with him about, is to combine the best of JEP-0027 and RFC
3923 -- you could do OpenPGP or S/MIME depending on service discovery
info (optionally auto-discovered via JEP-0115). The S/MIME stuff would
be simplified (essentially, no CPIM) if the other party is a native XMPP
entity (the CPIM stuff is there to function across XMPP and SIMPLE).

Now, neither OpenPGP or S/MIME enable you to repudiate what you said,
and if people find that important then they would need to do JEP-0116
(or something very much like it, such as Gaim's OTR plugin). So in part
the differences here come down to requirements and philosophy.

I'm not yet convinced that repudiability and perfect forward security
are core requirements for an end-to-end encryption system, since both
OpenPGP and S/MIME are better than nothing. But one thing that seems
attractive about JEP-0116 is that it doesn't require end users to create
OpenPGP keys or obtain X.509 certificates, both of which are hard for
end users. Instead, it could use RSA keys generated by the user's
client, thus shielding the user from key generation and management.
Anything that makes security technologies easier to use seems good (as
long as it's still safe).
