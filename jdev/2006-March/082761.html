It's not forbidden and I don't think it should be.

Exactly.

&gt;<i> As I think about this even /more/, I wonder if we should allow fallback of 
</I>&gt;<i> JIDs with nodes into the rfc822Name field.  
</I>
Remember that an rfc822Name is not UTF-8, so beware of i18n problems.

&gt;<i> This may help with

</I>
Sure, it's analogous to using CN for domains. I don't have strong
objections to the practice, but it is suboptimal in the sense that
id-on-xmppAddr is preferred.
