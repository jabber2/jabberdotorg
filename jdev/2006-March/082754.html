Requirements are exactly it.  The two camps will never agree on which 
style of cryptography to use, because:

In the pro-OTR camp, everyone thinks that cryptography should be used in
order to obfuscate what you said and remove traces that it was you who
said it.  So OTR will appeal in use cases where you want some kind of 
pseudo-anonymity.

(OTOH, Normal Person + Internet + Anonymity = Total Jackhole)

Then you have the pro-OpenPGP camp, people think that cryptography 
should be used in order to be able to prove who said something, 
_especially_ at a later point in time.  This is useful particularly in 
business, when someone wants to archive conversations for later auditing.)

Also in this camp you have all the people who were already using OpenPGP 
for some other reason, and therefore want to reuse their keys which they 
spent hours getting signed by dozens of people.

&gt;<i> But one thing that seems attractive about JEP-0116 is that it doesn't

</I>
X.509 certificates are certainly too hard to obtain for most users, 
mainly because they're worth practically nothing without the signature 
from the CA (CAcert is of course available for no cost, but it still 
takes time: time users can't be bothered to spend.)

With OpenPGP, creating the keys is easy, if not trivial.  Getting them 
signed (and hence trusted) takes the time.

I guess you can blame a lot of that on the lack of a &quot;simple&quot; GUI for 
signing keys (by &quot;simple&quot;, I refer not to KDE or GNOME simplicity, but 
MacOS simplicity.)

I often wonder if an instant messaging client might one day provide that 
simple interface...

    User: [initiates chat to a contact who has signed their presence]
    IM Client: &quot;Are you absolutely sure this person is the one you wish
                to talk to? [Yes/No/Ask me again later]&quot;
    User: Yes
    IM Client: [signs the key with a relatively low, but good-enough
                trust value.]

Add a nice indicator next to your contacts who have untrusted keys, and 
you have yourself an OpenPGP GUI which is almost as useful as the more 
advanced alternatives.  It's not with &quot;The Spirit&quot; of OpenPGP where you 
go and meet people in person, but it's certainly more realistic for the 
ordinary user.
