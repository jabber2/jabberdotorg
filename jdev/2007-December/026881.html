We more do more than agreeing, we (see sign, sorry for the indirect
spam) and other companies bet on this vision ;) If you search in the
archives of this mailing list you may find several examples of people
controlling remote devices using XMPP:

XMPP is a (near) real time messaging technology able of delivering
data to any node in the Internet and to mobile devices, solving most
of issues usually involved in what is normally called ubiquitous
computing. With XMPP you have:
 - a portable identity that can be associated to people, software
agents or devices;
 - a reliable message transport capable of real push behind NAT or to
mobile devices having roaming addresses;
 - presence, which means more than &quot;hey, I want to chat&quot;, presence is
an efficient way of distributing the whole status of a node to a set
of interested an authorized nodes (available resources, online status,
location and so on)
 - advanced machine 2 machine communication (XMPP is the only
transport able of naturally implementing all the SOAP message
patterns)
 - scalable one to many and many to many communications, using publish subscribe
 - a protocol that is sufficiently simple at the client side, thus
allowing implementation in very simple devices
 - the XMPP identity can be used as a sort of single sign on and, if
you trust the server handling your accounts, any service can securely
verify authorizations just checking the &quot;from&quot; attribute of messages
 - and, finally, an incredible list of standardized enhancements
implemented in many servers and client libraries, thus meaning fast
deployment of new services

All these things (and others I surely forgot) make XMPP on of the best
choices for asychronus messaging in distributed architectures,
especially when thousands and more of simultaneous online clients are
involved.
