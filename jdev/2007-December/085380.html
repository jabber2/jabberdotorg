</I>Not at present, no one seemed interested in the approach last time this 
subject came up (people at the time seemed to think roster item exchange 
was a better way) so I didn't bother, I just went ahead using a roster 
manipulation approach anyway as I didn't find roster item exchange 
satisfactory as it requires the client to handle things rather than the 
server, I feel its better to have the server and transport deal with it 
without the client needing to get involved which reduces complexity on 
the client side.

But basically the protocol is the normal roster protocol but works 
remotely by the transport addressing the IQ commands to the user's bare 
JID (i.e. without the resource), the transport has to have published its 
presence to the user (so the server can stop notifying the transport of 
roster modifications once its logged off), and there is a simple 
protocol for the transport to request access to the roster if it hasn't 
already got it (i.e. if it gets an access denied error when it tries to 
access it).
