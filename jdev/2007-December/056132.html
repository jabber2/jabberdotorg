Er, you're both correct.  The JCR is a small library which was written to allow jabberd14 components to run as a XEP-0114 component.  It contains lots of utility functions taken from old versions of the jabberd14 server (jid_user, jid_full, a hash table, memory pooling, string spools, etc), as well as the low level connection code used to connect to a XEP-0114 compatible Jabber server.

I don't know if the JCR is maintained as a standalone library anymore, but it is used by MU-Conference, and the JCR code is still fairly independent of the rest of the MU-Conference code.  MU-Conference can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://gna.org/projects/mu-conference/">http://gna.org/projects/mu-conference/</A> (I'd check it out from SVN, to make sure you have the latest code).

And you'll probably want to compare it to the other projects mentioned (iksemel and gloox) to determine which works best for you.
