The jabber-transport approach is not much appealing (and never was).
You still need to have AIM account to talk to AIM people.
Same for every other legacy IM network.

There isn't really much difference wether the legacy network client is a
separate application, built-in into the Jabber desktop client or Jabber
web client (the multicommunicator approach) or installed on server as a
transport and remote controlled using XMPP protocol.

This is not iteroperability, nor interconnectivity. These is just two,
not connected endpoints laying near, but still no connections between
them.


The real breakthrough would be if AOL (or ICQ, or MSN, or ...) would map
their accounts into XMPP address space and opened S2S connection
@aim.com to become a member of our federation...



But for now... I see nothing much exciting, that new web-based
multicommunicator appeared. Meebo and similiars are much more
featureful...
