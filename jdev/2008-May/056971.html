&gt;&gt;<i> I highly doubt they are dropping their technology, the web based chat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will im sure stay, just like google has the web based gtalk inside of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gmail, they are just adding an XMPP interface to their chat app.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they do, I wonder how sustainable that would be. That would seem like a
</I>&gt;<i> costly move.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Why would you say that? Their chat function seems to be scaling plenty 
well enough now so they have already done a lot of the work, and its not 
like they are going to really be able to use any of the already 
available servers as it would take too much work to integrate them into 
their infrastructure, not to mention the fact that I highly doubt any of 
them would be able to scale enough to be able to support the volume of 
users they have, they will do just as google have done and build their 
own, makes perfect sense to me.

&gt;<i> That's what I'm afraid of as well. Probably that they will also create
</I>&gt;<i> their own extensions like Google does. That's always a risk with companies
</I>&gt;<i> that claim using open standards... well to a certain extent.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Just have to see what happens, although I highly doubt they are going to 
create a whole load of their own custom extensions without going through 
the XSF as that would be pretty pointless as you wouldnt be able to use 
those features in all the current clients, and I doubt they are going to 
create their own as one of the stated objectives seems to be that you 
can use the XMPP client of your choice.
