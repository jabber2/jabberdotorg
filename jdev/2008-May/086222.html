Yes that seems reasonable.

&gt;<i> I am with Peter that adding new types to one of our three Stanza kinds
</I>&gt;<i> is not the proper way to solve this problem. First of all, we extend
</I>&gt;<i> through namespaces. Second, an iq is an ideal way to ask the server to
</I>&gt;<i> process something differently for you, in this case, how it handles
</I>&gt;<i> presence distribution. I think it is a nice separation of concerns.
</I>
If we were defining presence from the start, maybe we would include
type=&quot;invisible&quot;, but it was not something we defined in the beginning
and it has always been a kind of ugly stepchild. Either we can try to
dress up the ugly stepchild or use something that is functionally
equivalent, which I think the IQ approach is.

&gt;<i> My only concern with XEP-0186 is the security considerations section,
</I>&gt;<i> which advises not to reply to IQs. I don't think that is proper. If the
</I>&gt;<i> intend is for the client to not respond to incoming IQs, the server
</I>&gt;<i> should respond on behalf of the client. XEP-0126's security
</I>&gt;<i> considerations mention this nicely.
</I>
You're right, I will clean that up.

AFAIC, the fundamental problem here is that no one is excited enough
about invisibility to stand up and say &quot;yes I love and need this feature
and I will implement Spec X in the next 3 days if we can agree that it's
the right way to go&quot;. Whenever I sense a lack of enthusiasm, I hesitate
about pushing something forward. But sometimes the only way to get
consensus is to ask for a Last Call, so perhaps that's in order soon...
