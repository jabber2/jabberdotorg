&quot;If a pubsub node is addressable as a JID plus node, the pubsub service
SHOULD ensure that the NodeID conforms to the Resourceprep profile of
Stringprep as described in RFC 3920.&quot;

So basically you can include just about any character in a NodeID.

BTW, NodeIDs do not have semantic meaning (they are opaque as far as the
spec is concerned), but if a given deployment wants to attribute meaning
to &quot;/&quot; as a hierarchical separator (or whatever) then that's their business.

And remember that not everything needs to be defined at the level of
XEP-0060. You can define your own semantics on top of that in your own
application, without requiring any modifications to XEP-0060 itself. Or
so we hope. ;-)
