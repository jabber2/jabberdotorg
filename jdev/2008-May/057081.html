<PRE>Thanks for your time Jehan!
 
Sometimes I am unsure how to explain what I have in my head lol so let me try and clarify some more. Responses are found below.



&gt;<i> To: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jdev at jabber.org</A>&gt; From: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">list-jdev at jabberforum.org</A>&gt; Date: Sun, 25 May 2008 21:25:27 +0200&gt; Subject: Re: [jdev] PubSub &amp; News Feeds&gt; &gt; &gt; Kelly S;548 Wrote: &gt; &gt; Hiya.&gt; &gt; From what I can read on PubSub its clear how users subscribe to feeds&gt; &gt; and receive events but how can I handle a user requesting a feed that is&gt; &gt; not indexed on the server yet? So that the server can now start indexing&gt; &gt; that feed and begin Publishing new entries it pulls (I will be writting&gt; &gt; the service which starts pulling feeds off the web).&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here as far as I understand, and remembering your previous post, you&gt; want to be able to transform any RSS publication into a xmpp node&gt; publication. So the point here is that your pubsub tree is &quot;dynamic&quot;.&gt; From what I know, this is not in the basic XEP, because it implies a&gt; relation between the web and xmpp, which has not been planned (you&gt; wanted to tie the http url and the pubsub node, for instance a rss in&gt; <A HREF="http://subdomain.domain/some/path/feed/">http://subdomain.domain/some/path/feed/</A> would be in the node&gt; /subdomain.domain/some/path/feed/, didn't you?).&gt; Yet this is probably very easy to implement such service on a server:&gt; when querying a subscription, it would check whether the address you&gt; entered is indeed linking to a rss feed, then creating the associated&gt; node for beginning to pull.&gt; 
</I> 
I don't really need the node tree to reflect the url sub directory structure if thats what your mentioning in the &quot;/subdomain.domain/some/path/feed/&quot; path.
 
I've created a root node with the id of &quot;feeds&quot; and inside here is really where I just want to populate a whole ton of feeds. However I need to relate their web url somehow when trying to fetch these feeds because the &quot;service&quot; which is going to download &amp; publish is going to need to know where to publish to.
 
I have been looking at some APIs of PubSub managers etc and many take node id as a string and I wonder if I put a url in there with &quot;/&quot; its going to think that is a sub node tree structure when all I really need is the following (I think?):
 
/feeds/someurl/entries*
 
I hope this makes sense. I'm not sure how else to describe it.
&gt;<i> &gt; Also a bunch of concerns pop into my head that I'm still unclear about&gt; &gt; when maintaining all this &quot;feed&quot; data. 1. Is there any way I can just&gt; &gt; publish the latest feeds I pulled down and pubsub discard any duplicates&gt; &gt; that may already exist? Or is the right way to handle this is to query&gt; &gt; every single entry individually to check if they exist before publishing&gt; &gt; them? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here you would do simply like any normal agregator already does: you&gt; check the time. You know the last time you got any news on a RSS, hence&gt; you stop reading the feed to this date.&gt; 
</I> 
So basically I can request PubSub to send me the latest 1 item, take that date, then pull the RSS feed off the web, and only publish items newer? This makes sense I think. I was hoping I didn't have to execute queries before pushing data as that would put more load on the XMPP service but if I am able to request just 1 latest item  atleast thats minimizing the hit.
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks so much for your time &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You're welcome. ;-)&gt; 
</I> 
Again thanks so much. I am quite confused on how to relate the node structure to feed urls so hopefully I can get this figured out.
