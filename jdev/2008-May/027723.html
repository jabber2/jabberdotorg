<PRE>Sander Devrieze a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> 2008/5/15 JabberForum &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">list-jdev at jabberforum.org</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I aggree. I don't really see a point in having an open letter. They know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of our existence, and they'll contact us soon enough.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An open letter maybe can be useful if it is done as some kind of press
</I>&gt;<i> release. First contact several potential walled garden owners and get
</I>&gt;<i> them to support the open letter by switching to XMPP. Then list them
</I>&gt;<i> in this letter or let them publish this letter or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Overview of the battle field, in order of how easy it will be to get
</I>&gt;<i> them to use XMPP (I may be wrong here):
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Walled garden networks of social networks and things like
</I>&gt;<i> that&lt;--They will be the easiest to convert to XMPP as their market
</I>&gt;<i> share is too small and they need to start from zero regarding clients.
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP also seems to have the right features for them.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Yahoo&lt;--There market share is the smallest of the big walled garden
</I>&gt;<i> networks and I guess it is diminishing. Also, in order to get some
</I>&gt;<i> more protection against a hostile takeover of Microsoft, they may want
</I>&gt;<i> to adopt XMPP. As Micosoft really wants to get more important on the
</I>&gt;<i> Internet, this argument is also true for social networks that want to
</I>&gt;<i> protect themselves (cfr. Facebook)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) AIM/ICQ&lt;--I believe AOL's market share is also diminishing, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's still big and they don't have to fair a hostile takeover bid I
</I>&gt;<i> guess. It will be harder to get them converted. A good reason for them
</I>&gt;<i> to adopt XMPP early would be that they still have a big market share.
</I>&gt;<i> If they don't wait to long with switching, they will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> control the direction of XMPP more easily than if they wait until they
</I>&gt;<i> are forced to switch.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) MSN&lt;--This will be the hardest. I guess it may be XMPP versus MSN
</I>&gt;<i> for a relative long time. Microsoft integrated MSN in all its software
</I>&gt;<i> and services. The best way is probably to focus on giving the whole
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP world a stronger position in companies; if enough companies ask
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP support in Microsoft's products, Microsoft will be forced to add
</I>&gt;<i> it, but it will not be easy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

On the topic of walled garden:
