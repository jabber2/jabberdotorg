There are differences. Please read
<A HREF="http://coccinella.im/whytransportsmatter">http://coccinella.im/whytransportsmatter</A> first. I like most of the
projects you mention. This is why:

* XMPP gateways
See the Why Transports Matter article

* OpenOffice
Contrastingly to IM, closed format files are something that does not
disappear immediately when the software that creates these files
changes its format to an open standard. People will still have
documents laying around in this format for years. When an IM service
changes to an open standard such as XMPP, there is no need at all to
have support for the old closed network protocol. People still can't
travel back in time ;-)

* Samba
I don't know this project that good, but I guess there simply is no
good alternative, whereas for IM there is a very reliable alternative
as you may know. Correct me if I'm wrong.

* Cygwin
I believe this project is to add support to the Unix open standards on
a closed platform? I can't see how I can be against this; it's like
running Coccinella or any other XMPP client on Windows to get the by
default missing XMPP support.

* Wine
I really like this project. This project has the potential to destroy
the closed Windows API in the long term. I have some blog posts in
mind for this, though I need my own blog for that as that will be a
little bit too off topic for my blog at the Coccinella website I'm
afraid ;-) Anyway, major big difference is the same as for OpenOffice:
your PhotoShop CS2 will not change in a Linux version as of the moment
Adobe decides to add support for Linux; you will probably have to wait
a year and you will probably need to buy a new license whilst the CS2
version still suits you very well and you see no need to spend some
money for a new version.

&gt;<i> Your own posts contradict yourself:
</I>&gt;<i> - Bypassing Openfire: <A HREF="http://coccinella.im/bypassing-openfire-client-control">http://coccinella.im/bypassing-openfire-client-control</A>
</I>
I don't see with which this is contradictory, maybe this is my faul,
please explain.

&gt;<i> - Support for AIM/MSN: <A HREF="http://coccinella.im/coccinella-0.96.8">http://coccinella.im/coccinella-0.96.8</A>
</I>
Coccinella does not support AIM, MSN or any other walled garden; we
*only* support XMPP. We are supporting what is written here:
