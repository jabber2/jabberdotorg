We could have pep avatars come in as a dependency, but it does throw  
the requirement for PEP in there, and that means we should have PEP  
as a server dependency somewhere.

&gt;<i> 2 - Rich Messaging.
</I>
I've had a couple of issues with xhtml-im in the past, but I still  
think it's the way to go, for reasons other people have expressed  
more eloquently than me already. On the other hand, I'm not sure that  
xhtml-im belongs in here, someone try and persuade me otherwise, but  
at the moment I don't see this as a major part of IM for most people  
(compare to avatars, vcards or file transfer).

&gt;<i> 3 - VCards.
</I>
Probably fair.

&gt;<i> 4 - Bookmarks. This should be in the Intermediate Spec alongside MUC.
</I>
I don't have much complaint about this, if people think it should be  
required.

&gt;<i> 5 - XMPP IRI's.
</I>
I don't agree with this one, I think these /protocol/ compliance  
suites shouldn't address how the client interfaces with either the  
user or the operating system.

&gt;<i> 6 - We should require an XML Debug Window of some sort. Tie it to a
</I>&gt;<i> standard Keystroke (Exodus, Pandion, and our new Communicator all use
</I>&gt;<i> F12), so that it's practical to have a debug session with someone.  
</I>&gt;<i> This
</I>&gt;<i> should be in the Basic Spec.
</I>
Again, I don't think this is protocol. These are features users may  
care about, but they're the things the user can easily see on a  
checklist on the client's site; I think the cert suites are for the  
features a user can't easily check - primarily compliance to the RFC/ 
XEPs.

&gt;<i> 7 - We should require clients to support Start-TLS streams. This is an
</I>&gt;<i> optional thing in the RFC, but clients really need to support it. This
</I>&gt;<i> should be in the Basic Spec.
</I>
Clients probably do need to support this, yeah. I could probably be  
persuaded either way.

&gt;<i> 8 - Which MUC features do we want to require in the Intermediate spec?
</I>&gt;<i> All of them? (Kick / Ban / Voice / Configure / History / 1:1-&gt;MUC,
</I>&gt;<i> invites, etc) Or just the basic ones?
</I>
1:1-&gt;MUC's a thorny issue, but the rest, yeah.

&gt;<i> - An Install and uninstall mechanism that works with the target O/S
</I>&gt;<i> - A means to quickly and easily report a bug against the client.
</I>&gt;<i> - A means to upgrade the client from one version to another.
</I>
I'm not keen on any of the above, for reasons I've covered already:  
they're not relevant to a client's compliance. For a &quot;Best client  
awards&quot;, possibly (although as noted earlier these are of varying  
relevance on different platforms), but not for XMPP compliance.

&gt;<i> - File transfer. Come on guys! :)
</I>
Assuming you mean 96, yes, I do think this belongs in intermediate.

&gt;<i> ... that's some food for thought. Opinions?
</I>Now more mails to reply to :)
