&gt;<i> I've got a few issues that I think need being brought up:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - Avatars. It's a feature users expect, and a client without them
</I>&gt;<i> can't even be considered a toy these days. None of these client specs
</I>&gt;<i> talk about Avatars. This is something that needs to at least be in the
</I>&gt;<i> Intermediate spec.
</I>
I vote for the basic PEP XEP and do not specifically require any of
the XEPs that require PEP (like User Avatar)

&gt;<i> 3 - VCards. Everyone expects VCards (especially Avatars and Friendly
</I>&gt;<i> Names) in one form or another. This should be in the Basic Spec.
</I>
Same remark

&gt;<i> 4 - Bookmarks. This should be in the Intermediate Spec alongside MUC.
</I>
Not sure if this is needed

&gt;<i> 5 - XMPP IRI's. For example, if I have Exodus or Pandion running, and
</I>&gt;<i> click on an XMPP IRI in FireFox, the behavior works (mostly) as I expect
</I>&gt;<i> it to. This should be a required client feature for the Intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> (Advanced? Complete?) Spec.
</I>
+1

&gt;<i> 6 - We should require an XML Debug Window of some sort. Tie it to a
</I>&gt;<i> standard Keystroke (Exodus, Pandion, and our new Communicator all use
</I>&gt;<i> F12), so that it's practical to have a debug session with someone. This
</I>&gt;<i> should be in the Basic Spec.
</I>
I don't think this is useful to require.

&gt;<i> 7 - We should require clients to support Start-TLS streams. This is an
</I>&gt;<i> optional thing in the RFC, but clients really need to support it. This
</I>&gt;<i> should be in the Basic Spec.
</I>
Maybe

&gt;<i> 8 - Which MUC features do we want to require in the Intermediate spec?
</I>&gt;<i> All of them? (Kick / Ban / Voice / Configure / History / 1:1-&gt;MUC,
</I>&gt;<i> invites, etc) Or just the basic ones? I would say an intermediate client
</I>&gt;<i> MUST support joining a room, chatting in a room, and responding to
</I>&gt;<i> invites. I would continue to say that it's not required to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> configure a room, or perform admin features in the room.
</I>
What about requiring all of them for strategic reasons? It'll make it
easier for people that want to convert from IRC to Jabber.

&gt;<i> I would also, for BASIC clients, require:
</I>&gt;<i> - An Install and uninstall mechanism that works with the target O/S
</I>
I don't think this is useful to require (and btw: most Mac OS X
software does not an uninstaller, and on most open-source systems the
uninstall system is provided by the OS)

&gt;<i> - A means to quickly and easily report a bug against the client.
</I>
I don't think this should be in the spec. Also, how would you define
difficult terms like &quot;quickly&quot; and &quot;easily&quot;?

&gt;<i> I would include for Intermediate Clients:
</I>&gt;<i> - A means to upgrade the client from one version to another.
</I>
Also should not be in this spec IMO.

&gt;<i> - File transfer. Come on guys! :)
</I>
Maybe
