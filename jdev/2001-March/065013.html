*nod*, I was thinking the existing OpenPGP method (and your draft) would be
the datagram namespace.

A session-based method would require less bandwidth in most cases and less
processing/memory on the client systems. So it is probably advantageous to do
both :-)

I'm happy you are working on this - many applications require data to be
encrypted (some corps are really paranoid, encrypted files packed in an
archive, encrypt the archive and send it out over SSL). For something like
XMLRPC or SOAP to work with secure data over a client-server distributed
system like jabber, there has to be a way to encrypt that content.

Not to mention that people will want encrypted rich text just as much as they
want encrypted plaintext. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> For higher securty session based stuff, like chats or whiteboards or
</I>&gt;<i> something where both clients have to be online, using session key stuff
</I>&gt;<i> looks good... but for sending one time messages that are not session

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, thats probably the reason there aren't session keys in email either :-)
you can't negotiate a session if the other person isn't around.
