&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber as COM/DCOM replacement for linux.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --------------------------------------------
</I>
There is an effort beginning on a project know as JAM -- Jabber as
Middleware.  The project is in the design stage at the moment, and is
looking for input from *everyone*.

Now, would you say that using Jabber as Middleware, and using Jabber as
DCOM, would have similar goals?  Looking through the list of ideas Oliver
had mentioned, just about everything I noticed in that would be something
I would like in a middleware product.

Now, we should have an &quot;official&quot; place to discuss ideas real soon now..
but in the meantime, I suppose there's no reason not to discuss right
here.  Oliver, do you have some objectives you would like to accomplish
with a middleware/dcom project?  Ie, are you looking to solve a
particular problem with it?  Or are you mainly in the &quot;this would be
cool&quot; stage? :-)

As I had mentioned the other day, I am personally looking to solve a
problem in my workplace where we are using multiple programming languages
to develop the same applications.  What I'd like to do is write a single
backend, and two seperate front ends, and use Jabber for the three to
communicate.

I'm interested in your thoughts!  Thanks,
  -Eric
