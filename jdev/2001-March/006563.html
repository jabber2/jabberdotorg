<PRE>Hello all,

For all those interested in the idea of using Jabber as Middleware (JAM),
there is now a forum for this purpose!

The forum can be found at:
  <A HREF="http://jabber.org/?oid=532">http://jabber.org/?oid=532</A>

Posted there now are a few ideas to get things started.  Please comment
on these, and give your input.  We are looking for:

1. Case studies
  What sort of project you would like to use JAM for.

2. Specific requirements
  What in the world should JAM be?  What will make it a good middleware
  product?  What don't middleware products made by other vendors offer
  that JAM should?

3. Questions
  If you have any questions at all about the project and it's goals,
  please feel free to post them there.

4. Answers
  We definatly like answers to go with the questions ;-)  If you see a
  question that you happen to know the answer to, by all means go ahead
  and answer it!

5. Anything Else
  If you're just bored and feel like talking about peanut butter and
  jelly sandwiches, thats cool, we'll take a few of those too ;-)
  Seriously, if you have any opinion whatsoever, good or bad, relating to
  JAM, you really should post it :-)

If you have posted ideas to this list previously, by all means feel free
to repost them there.  Hmm... post post post.. I think that about covers
it :-)  See you there!
  -Eric
