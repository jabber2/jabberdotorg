Well, after chatting with Dizzy a little, I completely agree.  I was
leary at first since we'd have to reimplement a lot of the jabber:client
functionality.  However, he convinced me that it needed to be redone in a
new protocol, as the current method may not be robust enough for
middleware.

Oh yeah, wouldn't that be cool :-)  Actually, he's working on something
extremely similar, only in Java.  If we show him how far along Jabber is,
it might not be too hard to convince him.  And he's a good coder, so he'd
definatly be able to help out.  I think I'll drop him a line.. we could
use all the help we can get :-)  ttyl
