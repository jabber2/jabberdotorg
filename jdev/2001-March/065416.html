The friendly folks at AOL late last week started blocking libfaim (used in
gaim and Fire as well as presumably the Jabber AIM transport).

Top of tree gaim sources (at sourceforge.net) generally have the latest
workarounds. You'll have to dig into the oscar subtree, most likely. Last I
heard there was a new block added yesterday but as of this morning gaim had
a workaround. This tit-for-tat cycle is likely to continue since AOL has
infinite resources to throw at it and no more reason to be interested in
openness (courtesy of the FCC).
