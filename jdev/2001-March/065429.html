<PRE>&gt;<i>Well, do you think flaming the participants of this list is going to make them want to help you more?
</I>
To bring a point only. ( And I'm Flaming no one. )
 
&gt;<i>First off, the JDEV list is used by people to discuss development of new versions of Jabber servers and clients.  If you want to &gt;discuss how to install, configure, and use a Jabber server, you should be posting to JADMIN.
</I> 
The List you refer to &quot;if any&quot;. Is not Advertised on Jabber.org
A Second List Would be a great Suggestion.
 
&gt;<i>Second, I've been on this list about 6 months.  From what I've seen, questions that don't get answered are usually ones that nobody &gt;knows the answer to.  If nobody else has run into the same problems, then how is anyone supposed to help you?  Do you think the &gt;other readers of this list are somehow omniscient?  We're just normal guys like you.
</I> 
I'm NOT Referring to One post only. I'm referring to multiple Posts on Multiple Topics. Most of which I have resolved on my own.

&gt;<i>Remember, it's open source software.  If you can't make it work and nobody else can help, you've got all the source code right in &gt;front of you.  Dig in and start debugging!  And then tell everyone else what you found.  And if you find a bug, fix it and give the fix &gt;back to the community.  That's how these things work.
</I> 
Yes I could spend day feeding thru thousand of line of code. but that doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me. You ?
The purpose of a post is to get input on the problem. not Necessarily get an &quot;ANSWER&quot; Those with a much more in-depth knowledge of the system give a suggestion of were to start looking. that is generally how these thing work. I don't expect anyone to go hunting thru code to fix MY or anyone else's problem. Ideas and suggestions on where to look are what I get from most all other lists.
This LIST.... Nada. that is the point I wish to make. I've had my posts ignored before. but not as many and a frequently as this list.

I'm not flaming anyone.... I Just wish to bring attention to the issue.

&gt;<i>Solving port problems is generally outside the scope of Jabber anyhow.  The error message you're seeing is because there's another &gt;process that is listening to and has locked those ports.  Figuring out which process is your job as the administrator of your server.  &gt;Nobody else knows how your machine and firewall are configured.
</I>
Been there done that... Otherwise I would not have posted to this list.  ( I post to this list only in desperation. And I never expect a response. )

&gt;<i>Finally, if you have complaints about the quality of the FAQs, then pitch in to help improve them!  The entire Jabber open source &gt;project is based on user contributions from people like you and me.  Everyone agrees more work is needed on the documentation &gt;and FAQs.  So lend a hand.
</I> 
I usually do. But I've never had a problem resolved Via this list.

Oh, And thank you for the First Responce from this list I have ever HAD !!!!!!!

    I have never had this Problem with any other mailing list. Spanning from Debian-dev,boot,user. to dam IBM.
    Every time I post a question to this list. I never get a response. This list has a problem I've never seen in any other list.
    This is Bad. 
     
    I have a problem with my Server at current and this is not good. My company wants an IM system up yesterday. And I can't get support. I filed thru the mailing list archives all the way back to 1999. And I found some messages from other people with the same problem. 
    AND GUESS WHAT !!!!!
     
    There posts were never responded to.
     
    I'm not implying that every post should be Responded to, I am implying However, that Serious problems in or associated with the use of a jabber server are not small problems. And should be resolved and or added to a FAQ or Manual. FAQ's are easy, you just cut and past the Post with the question and answer in it, to the FAQ. Wow. that was hard.
     
    Every other list seams to have it together. What is it with this list ?
     
    [JDEV] Unable to listen on ports 5222 and 5269 Sheridan, Dann
    Post on Wed, 14 Feb 2001 11:29:03 -0500 
     
    &gt;&gt;I just built Jabber on a RedHat 7.0 box running xinetd.  When I go to start
    &gt;&gt;jabberd, I get alerts back saying that jabberd is unable to listen on ports
    &gt;&gt;5222 and 5269.  Has anyone else run into this problem?  If so, how did you
    &gt;&gt;resolve it?  I've already tried adding these ports to /etc/services, but
    &gt;&gt;this didn't help.
     
    Can Anyone Help this Person ?
