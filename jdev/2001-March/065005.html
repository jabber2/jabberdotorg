<PRE>I'm not sure if I understand the significance of, &quot;specifically for
sending namespace fragments, and not for sending entire XML documents. In
particular, specify whether you can send multiple namespace extensions
through, and make sure people know they cannot do  things like insert a
DTD or PI instructions (including &lt;?xml version=1.0?&gt;&quot;

You mean whether they can send more than 1 &lt;x&gt; element within the
encrypted block? Why is sending entire xml messages illegal?

I think an error reporting method - ie &quot;I dont recognise this
namespace&quot; would be a good thing. For the client to simply send back a
message saying &quot;huh? i dont understand namespace xyz?&quot; is what I'm
thinking. I'm thinking that there's already some support for this - i sort
of recall hearing about this somewhere.

I think we need a better method of key exchange - maybe an ability to use
a 3rd party certificate authority. Of course, this is all client
dependant, and does not necessarily need to have anything to do with
jabber it's self; but I do think that we need a standard. Like you said,
if it's easy to forge online messages that include the user's public key
(to later be used for encrypted messages sent to the user), its hard to
trust that we're actually sending to who we want to. Different levels of
key security should be offered:

	low: dont ever use encrypted messages
	medium low: accept whatever key user claims on presence
	medium: warn on change from last known key
	medium high: 3rd party certificate authority
	high: manual key exchange

My two main concerns with jabber security are the ability to send messages
encrypted (of any sort) and the strength of key exchange between clients.

I think that if we can secure key exchange, and offer a way to send &lt;x&gt;
elements encrypted (since all extentions should use x elements right?) we
can provide a way for developers to implement their own secure private
namespaces in their clients, to fill their needs. Right now, unless they
implement what we're talking about, people cant really write extentions
that are nice and secure, which sucks.

</I>&gt;<i> careful of clients who say 'err, hmm, no i don't support encrypted content,
</I>&gt;<i> could you send it again in plaintext?'
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would the client ever want to know the namespace of the encrypted block before
</I>&gt;<i> decrypting? If you send me an encrypted xhtml block, and I don't support rich
</I>&gt;<i> text...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I fear multiple extensions in a message, all encrypted. Five pgp blocks

</I>&gt;<i> with your proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other than that, I would suggest adding the following comments:

</I>&gt;<i> - Make sure for future note that clients should recognize encrypted content.
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, a jabber:x:delay packet indicates a message delay - the server
</I>&gt;<i> cannot verify that someone isn't forging a message delay timestamp if it is
</I>&gt;<i> encrypted, so a client would need to have the logic to discard this information
</I>&gt;<i> (or even better, indicate someone is trying to fake an older message).
</I>&gt;<i> - Specify specifically if character encoding matters. Everything Jabber uses
</I>&gt;<i> UTF8, so I assume this would as well.
