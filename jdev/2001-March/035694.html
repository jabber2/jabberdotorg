<PRE>I am investigating current IM solutions for my company
and have some very basic questions about jabber:

1. I know the jabber1.4 server release says that it
*can* run on Sun Solaris and Linux and *should* be
able to build and run under most Unix.

Is there a list of platforms with O/S versions that
this has been done. I would like to build and run
our own server on Linux RH -7. From some of the
discussions it seems it does'nt build on RH 7,
and that RH 5.x is better.

Please comment, if possible.

2. In the discussions section of jabber.org I found
a good amount of discussion on clients, and if I
summarise them it would be that a majority or at
least lot of people could not get the client to
work (mostly with the jabber.org servers, don't
know if they have tried others). So:

  a) Is there a standard jabber server and client
     that one can use to do validation testing, before
     proceeding to invest in this technology?
     What has been the experience of jabber.org with
     their servers, in terms of crashes, hangs etc. OR
     criticil, show stopper, bugs.
  b) We will be interested in a win32 client. Do people
     reading this e-mail have any comments on windows
     clients?

3. One of the major factors in determining which IM
system to go with, is how stable it is. One indication
of this would be some stats on traffic or usage. For
example, ICQ has been in use for long and one is comfortable
regarding it's stability. Along these lines are there any
independent testimonies published somewhere, sites, magazines
etc. about jabber.

The reason for not going with ICQ is that I would like,
a public open source system, like apache (something
not owned by a company) and the XML messaging protocol
approach.

Any and all help and/or education on this topic
would be greatly appreciated.
