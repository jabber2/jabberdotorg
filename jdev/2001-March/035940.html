Actually, encryption wouldn't solve any of problems outlined in the article. If you save logs of messages on a computer, that machine could be stolen and the logs passed on to others. Encryption will stop people listening in to the message as it is sent, it won't solve any other problems (yes you could encrypt the entire log file but chances are the key will be stored on the machine some way obvious). 

In reality the only way to avoid this problem is to never save logs from instant messaging conversations. In the same way that its wise not to record phone calls its sensible to not record IM conversations (and probably wise to ensure that the client you use does not have the ability to save logs).
