<PRE>My group is about to embark on just this task (transferring files P2P).  I
haven't recently looked through the existing specs but I don't remember
there being anything specific besides the &quot;use OOB messages&quot; bit.
 
I agree that it would be useful to have a standard refusal/cancel message so
the sender can be sure to kill the listen... what else is missing.
 
The whole firewall/NAT thing is a pain too, but normal HTTP requests get
through all these so maybe making this tranfer look like one of those would
do the trick... only catch is (like I believe you said) if both users are
behind a firewall/NAT, then we get into talking about modifying the server
which I want to avoid if possible.  Another possible solution is to have a
&quot;temporary storage&quot; app on a server which would accept files with a randomly
generated name which you pass to the receiver client so that they can make
that request of the server.  Would work, but means more server load and more
to manage.
 
I'm currently not concerned about security, but this may change.
 
I'm sure I will hitting on some needs and ideas soon enough, post more if
you have any ideas and I will do the same.

Subject: [JDEV] Q: oob and direct P2P communications



(I brought this up within an earlier message but I think it's worth raising
to a separate thread, esp. since I got no answers / comments.) 


The 'oob' namespace seems to be Jabber's current answer for direct
peer-to-peer communications, particularly file transfer. However, the
documentation I've seen is really vague and leaves me with worries about its
reliability and security. Let me list the problems I see, together with some
possible solutions. 


Also, have any clients implemented file transfer or other oob communications
yet? 


As I understand it the flow of control looks like this: 

* Sender opens a TCP port on its host and listens for HTTP connections on
it. 

* Sender sends a Jabber message to receiver with an 'oob'-namespace element
containing an HTTP URL pointing to its own IP address and the opened port. 

* Receiver initiates an HTTP download via the URL. 

* Sender gets the HTTP connection on the port it opened and sends the file
data. 

* Both sides close the connection, and the sender stops listening on that
port. 


Major concern. 

This does not work if the sender is behind any sort of a firewall and/or a
NAT (network address translation) service. This applies to me personally
both at home and at work. It does however support the receiver being behind
any sort of firewall that allows HTTP connections (though the receiver's
client may need to go through an HTTP proxy server.) 

It also relies on the sender giving out its IP address, which many people
are loath to do for security reasons. 


This can be addressed by allowing the sender's Jabber server to act as a
proxy: the message is rewritten to include a URL pointing to the server, and
the server then proxies the incoming request through to the sender. This
does of course require additional smarts on the part of the server, as well
as placing additional bandwidth demands on it (but no more than the kinds of
demands that are currently made on HTTP proxies, for instance.) 


Secondary concern. 

I'm unsure how a secure association can be made on the sender between the
outgoing file transfer offer and the incoming HTTP request. The sender
generally wants to be sure that only the specific entity the message was
sent to can download the file, not some random other entity that may be
probing the sender's machine for open ports. 


This can be addressed in a weak way by using a random port number, but since
only 64536 numbers are generally available, that's not very secure. 


Stronger security could be obtained via regular HTTP authentication, by
adding a username and (randomly generated) password to the URL. 


Of course, for greatest security, the entire message containing the URL
would have to be encrypted to guard against interception. 


Third (tertiary?) concern. 

The receiver may well decide not to download the file at all (especially if
it's named something like &quot;sexy_babes.exe&quot;.) There doesn't seem to be any
defined mechanism for the receiver's client to indicate to the sender that
this has occurred. 

This means that the sender's client has to keep listening on that port until
some kind of time-out occurs, and the sender him/herself may get confused
wondering when the receiver is going to get around to receiving the file. 


Looks like there ought to be some kind of standard reply message type
indicating a refusal to download the file, so the sender's client can close
the port and present a GUI notification.
