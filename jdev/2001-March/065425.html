<PRE>I have never had this Problem with any other mailing list. Spanning from Debian-dev,boot,user. to dam IBM.
Every time I post a question to this list. I never get a response. This list has a problem I've never seen in any other list.
This is Bad. 

I have a problem with my Server at current and this is not good. My company wants an IM system up yesterday. And I can't get support. I filed thru the mailing list archives all the way back to 1999. And I found some messages from other people with the same problem. 
AND GUESS WHAT !!!!!

There posts were never responded to.

I'm not implying that every post should be Responded to, I am implying However, that Serious problems in or associated with the use of a jabber server are not small problems. And should be resolved and or added to a FAQ or Manual. FAQ's are easy, you just cut and past the Post with the question and answer in it, to the FAQ. Wow. that was hard.
 
Every other list seams to have it together. What is it with this list ?

[JDEV] Unable to listen on ports 5222 and 5269 Sheridan, Dann
Post on Wed, 14 Feb 2001 11:29:03 -0500 

&gt;&gt;<i>I just built Jabber on a RedHat 7.0 box running xinetd.  When I go to start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>jabberd, I get alerts back saying that jabberd is unable to listen on ports
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>5222 and 5269.  Has anyone else run into this problem?  If so, how did you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>resolve it?  I've already tried adding these ports to /etc/services, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>this didn't help.
</I> 
Can Anyone Help this Person ?
