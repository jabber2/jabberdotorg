<PRE>This gives me an idea-

Has anybody considered the concept of a 'template' or 'default' account in
Jabber servers, such that when new accounts are created, their subscriptions
and other defaults are populated from the settings of the 'template'?

I like the concept (auto-subscription). For my client, they would prefer to
require new users to take some action to activate the jabber account, and
only then push the subscription to their presence into all of the existing
accounts on the server. If somebody has never used their account, I see no
reason to crowd every user's subscription info with the inactive accounts.


&gt;<i> &gt; Because there seems to be a generated hash code in each user.xml

</I>
For my application, I'm looking at many thousands of employees with the
potential to access the service, of which maybe only a few hundred will ever
actually use Jabber.

What I'm planning on is using our existing LDAP and a web server to
provide a simple registration page (with info on Jabber, and links to
'approved' Jabber clients for downloading) that will invoke a CGI to
generate the new account's XML file.


&gt;<i> &gt; I downloaded Jabberbeans and was thinking of writing a client specifically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for this purpose.  A bonus would be to integrate LDAP somehow since that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where our user info is stored.  Has anyone gone down this road?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had to do this too and I found that perl/Net-Jabber was the fast and

</I>
I'll have to take a look at perl/Net-Jabber. Can you release your sample code?
