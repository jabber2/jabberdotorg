<PRE>My intent was the use of IP multicast.  My desire is to have
several multicast sessions that can be joined by lots of
users (like a group chat) without the overhead of multiple
point-to-point messages being sent by the server.

If multicast is supported then in a local session (TTL=1), a
message sent to everyone in the group (say 100 people) would
only require the transmission of the message twice: once
from user to multicast session and once from multicast
session to the &quot;community&quot;.


Here's a concept where it would be nice to have:  lets say I
have  a lot of little robots running around connected
wirelessly.  As they come within  range of the wireless
area, they register to the Jabber server.  Server
acknowledges and sends them a roster of sessions that are
applicable to the network.  one happens to be location
monitoring.  Well the little device which has a GPS receiver
on it now knows to report periodically its position to the
&quot;session&quot;.  All other robots report position as well.  Each
robot processes all the position information to determine
and take necessary action if there is a proximity problem
(someone enters their &quot;space&quot;).  You can see where the
volume of traffic can be significant especially if there are
lots of robots and the cycle time is fairly short.  Sure
Jabber was not initially designed for this type of
application, but I think it could work at least in a proof
of concept.  I was just hoping (dreaming) that multicast
sessions might be supported in the architecture or be a
fairly easy enhancement.

The envelop thing looks to me to be a client side request
(spam) whereas in a multicast scenario the client doesn't
know who the final recipients are.  It is much like using
the broadcast.

Also, there are mechanisms for multicast to work on
TCP/IP -- although it fits a UDP/IP transport much easier.

One concept myself and Sue thought of a while back was to
have envelope allow
forwarding of up to say, ten people. After that, you have
some sort of
'messaging-list' concept, which requires subscription. I
mentioned messaging
lists earlier on this thread.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An alternative to using TCP (or UDP) multicast would be
</I>to add
&gt;<i> &gt; some intelligence into the core delivery logic which
</I>would permit
&gt;<i> &gt; a single message to be sent to multiple people on a
</I>host..maybe
&gt;<i> &gt; by doing something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;message mto='@jabber.org'&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&lt;stream:maddress&gt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">dizzyd at jabber.org</A>&lt;/stream:maddress&gt;
&gt;<i> &gt;       &lt;stream:maddress&gt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">job at jabber.org</A>&lt;/stream:maddress&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       &lt;body&gt;Hey fool!&lt;/body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/message&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a nice, fairly clean way of doing multicast. Of
</I>course,
&gt;<i> &gt; the application generating the message would have to do
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; aggregration, but that's normal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The downside, of course, is that this would be a most
</I>excellent
&gt;<i> &gt; tool for spamming. :)
