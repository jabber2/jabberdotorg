<PRE>I wrote a little something at <A HREF="http://jabber.org/index.php?oid=651,">http://jabber.org/index.php?oid=651,</A> or here
is the text. Let me know what you think!
...

I asked Jer, and Jabion means 'Jabber-Vision'. It is implied (see the
title).

My belief is that Jabber is only as good as the clients on both ends of a
conversation. Sure, the server may continue on growing, but if everyone is
out there using unfriendly/incomplete clients (Jabberzilla ;-), then their
impression of Jabber will not be good.

(One thing that I have noticed is how the term 'Jabber' has a similarity
with 'Linux', because their definition depends on how the technology is
presented and used)

Everyone in the Jabber community has an idea of what the ultimate Jabber
client is. These ideas seem to be mostly the same, from talking with many of
you. So, how do we get there? What are we looking for?

Somehow we need to work on a client project together, as a group. Not all
would have to program, but anyone with Jabber technical knowledge would be
of help in some form. Like Jer says, manpower is limited, so we have to help
each other out as much as possible.

We all use different types of computers, and have different wants and needs
of a Jabber client. Therefore, the client has to be cross-platform and
flexible. There should be an infrastructure built so anyone can come along
and easily create their own Jabber client to fit their needs. In other
words, create building blocks (feature components) that author can use as
needed, or build their own based on a specification.

How we should do this... is up for discussion :-)
