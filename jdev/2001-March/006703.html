<PRE>Integration of full support for XML-RPC and SOAP

Before I jump into the whats and hows, I want to explain what these
ideas are based on and give them a single generic term: HTTPX.  All of
the work I've been  
doing so far is focused on making the XML bits in Jabber fully
accessible via HTTP, supporting any XML-over-HTTP methodology.  So
instead of speaking here to the
specific work being done to support XML-RPC, SOAP, or any other
HTTP+XML, I'll be using the term 'HTTPX'.                             


There are two ways in which I've been working on blending the XML and
methodologies of Jabber into HTTPX: accessibility of IM/Presence
functionality, and 
native HTTPX call/transport between any Jabber entities.  The first is
an obvious and long-wanted feature, opening up the Instant Messaging
and Presence
Management functionality existing within the Jabber architecture to
applications via HTTPX.  It's already easy to support Jabber, and
although this will add a new
way of accessing Jabber that may be easier, the exciting part is the
potential to extend the power of server interoperability, user
addressing, sync and async
messaging, and presence notifications to the world of HTTPX already
growing.      

The other step forward is in supporting the XML namespaces and calls
used in HTTPX within Jabber natively.  This will allow any Jabber
entity to make and 
receive HTTPX requests just as they would send a message or receive a
presence notification.  The generic namespaces in XML-RPC and SOAP
open the doors for
software using Jabber to do much more than IM and presence, and for
the reach of the software to extend beyond into the growing services
supporting HTTPX.

Jabber is an open project being created by individuals interested in
solving technical
problems to make their software work together better.  Opening up the
excellent work done on Jabber via HTTPX will benefit even more
individuals and software
development.  This has been an area I've been working hard on
supporting, and am inviting others to join me in melding Jabber and
HTTPX.
