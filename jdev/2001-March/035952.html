Probably if he saw it, he would keel over dead (&quot;the horror! the horror!&quot;)

People can dislike it, but the facts are:
1. all their friend use it
2. it does what they need to
3. it doesn't crash often (unless you are using visual studio or running
AIM)

I think in some cases bad UI design (like skins for an application,
similarity to a physical device, etc) are things that look 'nifty' to an
end user, and therefore are interpreted as 'selling points'. Witness
quicktime 4.
