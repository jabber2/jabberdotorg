<PRE>Hehe, I'm only working on this because I havn't seen evidence of anyone
else working on it. In fact, I havn't ever actually encrypted a file in my
life :) or wait, maybe I have, but I've never used pgp or gpg or anything
hehe.

I'm not used to working with XML either really, and I'm not aware of the
subtleties that you allude to when discussing what particular range of xml
elements we're going to allow to be encrypted (a whole xml doc, or just an
x element, etc)?

&gt;<i>From what I know now my impression is that it'd be better to define
</I>routing information (to, from, etc) in a route element; then a sub element
to define message, presence, etc... and I'd say make an &lt;encrypted&gt;
element, so that we can encrypt presence, messages, or anything else we
may wana add later. But I think it's probably too late for that unless
someone wants to start working on jabber NG :)

Thoughts? :)
