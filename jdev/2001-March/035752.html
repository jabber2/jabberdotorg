<PRE>Alrighty, well if anyone is interested, here was the mockup file i created
recently on how i was going to lay out my .web infastructure... it was just
some jotted down notes.

&quot;.web, in short&quot;

Will provide a secure, jabber based method of interfacing with other jabber
based applications that maintain pyzr.com. (middleware)

Every .web application will have a client and a server. The client will
login using a global user.xml file, which will download a roster with all
the .web apps he is subscribed to. The resource of the client will always be
hard coded.

Features:
Security
Instant Messaging
Works from anywhere
The technews.web will be the first pyzr.web.app. It will allow people to
create, submit and post new technews articles on the pyzr.com website

Each .web application will:

-use a simliar .web protocol structure embedded within jabber... but its
attributes will be customized to meet its needs. nodes may also be added.
-have the ability to block users, or unsubscribe from their presence. If a
request is received from a user it is not subscribed to, the request will be
'binned'...or blocked
-will control a 'que' of requests
-will have the ability to deny requests if an iq:version request detects an
incompatible version
-will consist client apps, and a server app.
-will be completely useless if it is not subscribed to any .web server apps.
-will have encryption security

Some additional notes:
a .web client's subscription request can only be confirmed by a human on the
.web server end. A subscription request MUST never interfere with normal
operations of the .web server. A que method is most efficient for this.
no one .web application will control all the .web servers. They are
independent. However, there can be assigned admin JIDs that can have special
abilities... such as shutting it down, restarting.. etc

-------------
END OF FILE

here is an example of an xml packet i used in the old Mantis project. This
was sent through the jabber message interface to the mantis server. From
there it was forwarded on to the JID of the app provided below to be
processed (pending some security measures first)

Pyzr..

If you have some details about your implementation/issues/approach that you
would like
to share, please feel free do so! We need contribution from _everyone_. :)
