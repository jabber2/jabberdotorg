</I>
I can't speak to the &quot;legality&quot; of these transports, since I don't know
how open their protocols are. However, I can say that unlike AOL with
regard to AIM, MSN and Yahoo have not been zealous about blocking access
to their networks in any way (perhaps since they are more concerned
about growing their userbase than in protecting their turf). In
addition, both are members of the IMUnified organization and therefore
have at least a putative interest in interoperability. 

So could they potentially block Jabber? Yes. Are they likely to? Right
now, it seems not. But they might change their minds.
