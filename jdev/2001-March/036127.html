<PRE>The intention isn't to get into a NameSpace Race. (yeh, I'm clever).  I
don't think it makes too much of a difference if current clients cannot/will
not support all namespaces.  Sure there are ones that need to be supported
for sake of widely distributed functionality, as well as an understanding of
what a common support approach would be.  Netscape nor IE (for examples)
supported every one of the HTTP protocols in their early inceptions.  Lest
we forget that Jabber is still an infant (and granted, the kid's growing
fast)!

OOB is nice.  I like the idea of having it for downloading of files, etc.

My understanding (which perhaps is limited) is that the jabber:x namespace
was made to support extensibility.  This would suggest that not all clients
will support all the namespaces within it.

I truly believe that the advertising topic (for lack of better description)
is a viable one and one that needs addressing.  I will glom all my thoughts
on this and produce a thing on it.  Help is more than welcomed, especially
if you're developing within the JAM space.

Being in OOB doesn't preclude being in an IQ or X context - OOB qualifies 
both. Anyway, IMHO, taking this independently of anything, it would seem
that
OOB doesn't fit the bill as it only contains URL and DESC. So some ad-type
namespace may be more appropriate...

Of course, there's always the balance of new namespaces vs current client 
support...
