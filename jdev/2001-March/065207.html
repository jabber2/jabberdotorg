  Unless I misunderstood, there is a set of good reasons:
    - you don't want to have to load and use a DTD to check those
      entities (yes it's a major pain on top of SAX and would definitely
      be too costly on the servers !).
    - you don't want either to use an internal subset (I wonder how many
      Jabber client or server would choke on this [1])
    - all those entities would be used to express single chars which are
      cleanly, unambiguously and easilly expressible and prossessable as
      character references instead.
    - the DtD don't define any entity
      <A HREF="http://protocol.jabber.org/jabber/jabber.dtd">http://protocol.jabber.org/jabber/jabber.dtd</A>
      and is not written in an extensible way which would allow to
      define them as extensions.
Of course this conflicts with the possibility of extending message content
with HTML basic (or SMIL basic) but again all the entities they define can
be conveniently replaced by chareacter references.

 No entities in Jabber please, thanks !

[1] and unless I have missed it there is nothing about entities, PIs
    or Dtd defined in the jabber spec. It would be a good idea to
    define a similar rule as in SOAP where there are all forbidden
    (well more precisely, DOCTYPE and PIs are forbidden, which means
     that no entity can be attached and in this case finding an
     entity reference is a well formedness error).
