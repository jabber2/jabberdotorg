<PRE>&gt;<i> jabber is nothing like COM. it is simple. and jabber::middleware
</I>&gt;<i> should be targeting exactly this niche. the simple, low-tech
</I>&gt;<i> technology can really benefit from it, and, it doesn't take much
</I>&gt;<i> to get there.
</I>
Well, I agree that jabber:middleware will have a big role in this area.
However, it would definatly be a lot more then a web tool.  Even at my
current place of work, it would be a method of bridging languages and
platforms.  Many of the developers use Windows, the others use Linux.
However, with Jabber, we can all work together.

On that note -- the project I am working on, the OpenThought Engine
(openthought.net), is taking a new direction because of JAM, and I hope
that it'll become a useful tool for web developers.  It's currently a
method of creating web apps that don't require the page to reload.  But
it'll be so much more when I Jabberify it :-)

&gt;<i> simple things stick. this is why html became big enough for people
</I>&gt;<i> to try using for what it shouldn't be used. i'm sure that if
</I>&gt;<i> jabber::middleware will be as simple, you  w i l l  find it being
</I>&gt;<i> used as a replacement for corba one day :)
</I>
I sure hope so!  If we're talking simple, it shouldn't be hard at all for
this to kick CORBA's butt :-)
