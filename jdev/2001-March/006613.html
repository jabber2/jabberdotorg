(Agreed * 1000), Eric.

We literally have 6 jabber servers in different states that we're using for
development and testing and yet we are NOT running one for IM use... why?
There is no complete / friendly client out there (no offense to you client
developers.. but, hey..), not to mention we have users on Win32, MacOS and
Linux.

I am all for supporting such a client development.  It is something I have
heard many people say about Jabber: &quot;Wow, that's great.. I wish there was a
good client.&quot;

The component idea I think would work.  Start by defining an API for each
component and then maybe have groups working in different languages to do
this (to me, Java is an obvious choice, but there are concessions you make
using Java for cross-platform work).  I know JabberBeans is an extensive
effort by David Waite, but what clients use it?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote a little something at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://jabber.org/index.php?oid=651,">http://jabber.org/index.php?oid=651,</A> or here
</I>&gt;<i> is the text. Let me know what you think!
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I asked Jer, and Jabion means 'Jabber-Vision'. It is implied (see the
</I>&gt;<i> title).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My belief is that Jabber is only as good as the clients on 
</I>&gt;<i> both ends of a
</I>&gt;<i> conversation. Sure, the server may continue on growing, but 
</I>&gt;<i> if everyone is
</I>&gt;<i> out there using unfriendly/incomplete clients (Jabberzilla 
</I>&gt;<i> ;-), then their
</I>&gt;<i> impression of Jabber will not be good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (One thing that I have noticed is how the term 'Jabber' has a 
</I>&gt;<i> similarity
</I>&gt;<i> with 'Linux', because their definition depends on how the 
</I>&gt;<i> technology is
</I>&gt;<i> presented and used)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone in the Jabber community has an idea of what the 
</I>&gt;<i> ultimate Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> client is. These ideas seem to be mostly the same, from 
</I>&gt;<i> talking with many of
</I>&gt;<i> you. So, how do we get there? What are we looking for?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Somehow we need to work on a client project together, as a 
</I>&gt;<i> group. Not all
</I>&gt;<i> would have to program, but anyone with Jabber technical 
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge would be
</I>&gt;<i> of help in some form. Like Jer says, manpower is limited, so 
</I>&gt;<i> we have to help
</I>&gt;<i> each other out as much as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We all use different types of computers, and have different 
</I>&gt;<i> wants and needs
</I>&gt;<i> of a Jabber client. Therefore, the client has to be cross-platform and
</I>&gt;<i> flexible. There should be an infrastructure built so anyone 
</I>&gt;<i> can come along
</I>&gt;<i> and easily create their own Jabber client to fit their needs. In other
</I>&gt;<i> words, create building blocks (feature components) that 
</I>&gt;<i> author can use as
</I>&gt;<i> needed, or build their own based on a specification.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How we should do this... is up for discussion :-)
