I think too many people who want to use jabber are influenced by the ICQ
Clients and the ICQ Client interface. Ok, Jabber is also an IM service,
but it's more and people should know that it's not ICQ. 
The fact that most of the clients are open-source makes it difficult to
develop the perfect jabber client. Many people code the clients in their
free time and it's not their main job. But the clients become more and
more powerful and they're open to the whole world. And that's their
advantage. So the clients will never be perfect but at the time most of
the clients are very useful and if someone really wants to change
something in its behaviour then he should learn to program and modify it.

I agree with this. There should heavier work an jabber libraries. If the
libs are fast and have a defined API Client developing would be easier and
faster. 
That's what I think.
