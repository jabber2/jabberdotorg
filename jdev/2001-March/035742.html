<PRE>I've been reading this thread back and forth and boys, you need to 
go do a lot of reading first. Don't reinvent the #%@! wheel. In 
particular read Schneir's Applied Crypto and Secrets &amp; Lies, plus 
the docs on the AES standard as well as the docs on SSL/TLS 
(there's also a good book on it, don't have it inf front of me, but it's 
the only one on Amazon :).

You're down the right track. Symetric encryption (used by DES and 
Rijndael) is much more effecient than Asymetric (used by Public 
Key encryption such as PGP or X.509), but you do have a problem: 
how to share the key. 

SSL has the same situation. The way SSL solves it is to use PK 
(through the use of X.509 certificates) to authenticate the session 
(at least the server must authenticate itself, the client auth is 
optional). Then the server sends a random key to be used 
(normally this is 3DES or RC4, but Rijndael would be a better 
choice). 

Another way to negoitate the key is to use Diffie-Hellman protocol, 
but that's almost as much overhead as using PK &amp; not nearly as 
secure.

If you were using a totally stream based system and could 
negotiate a key, then Blowfish would be a better choice. 

You could use SSL to negotiate a session between two parties but 
there's no gurantee that you're on the same server (at least with 
HTTP based XML-RPC you know the app is on the same server). 
Thus if you want the speed of symetric with Jabber, you're probably 
better off setting up a protocol that uses a secure timestamp to 
note latency (ie. say the session is considered over if we don't hear 
anything after x seconds) OR use presence to denote session 
(session is over once either client denotes not-available). Use PGP 
or X.509 cert to verify one another. Then exchange the key. then 
use a symetric encryption to perform the application encryption.

However, SSL or simple message based PK is going to be fine 
99% of the time. Most people don't want hard-core encryption, they 
just want to know that the majority of the world can't read their 
messages without going through a lot of trouble. And a lot of 
people would really just settle with knowing who they were talking 
to ( alot of spam would simply stop if we required signed email), 
and encryption can come or go.

Plus Jabber (and other XML-RPC protocols) are just transport 
layers. while they should have some type of encryption in them, 
applications built on-top of them will require their own particular 
security. That's the 1% standard SSL and PK won't contain. But 
the good news there's plenty of $$ to be mined in them thar hills :).

If you really want to see how encryption should really work in a 
program, check out Groove (www.groove.net). It uses X.509 as the 
default. You don't turn it on. You can't turn it off. It's seemless. 
Groove is what the future should be. :). Oh, Groove was designed 
by Ray Ozzie who created Lotus Notes and was fighting crypto 
battles before most of this list was in grade school (or even born, 
though that makes *me* feel old :).
