<PRE>Hmm... I'm wondering if this is related to something I've been trying
to track down. I've been seeing a similar situation while trying to 
get jabberd to deal with SIGHUP properly. I didnt delve as deeply into 
pth's guts, but I did diagnose it down to pth waking up in the scheduler
prematurely, and calling abort(). ie.. the below..
**Pth** SCHEDULER INTERNAL ERROR: no more thread(s) available to schedule!?!?

I am usually seeing mio as the last log entry prior to the signal. I took
a break to work on some other projects.  My gut says that this might likely
be caused by the fork within the threaded environment. are we missing a
pth_atfork_push() call to clean up something in the childs environment?
I could be offbase with this line of thought though. 

Hopefully the fix to one of our problems is the fix to both. I'll be looking
into this more tomorrow.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have rebuilt libpth in debug mode (-DPTH_DEBUG), and am running jabberd
</I>&gt;<i> in debug mode (-D) as well.
</I>&gt;<i> Within the dnsrv module, the process is running in the infinite loop in
</I>&gt;<i> dnsrv_child_main(), around line 140, where it is repeatedly reading from
</I>&gt;<i> a dns_io.  The server runs fine as long as there is not a read error here.
</I>&gt;<i> As soon as we get a read error, this dnsrv child process exits with the
</I>&gt;<i> expectation that the parent process will restart it.  The parent goes through
</I>&gt;<i> the libpth code --- via pth_spawn(), to pth_connect_ev(), then pth_wait(),
</I>&gt;<i> then pth_yield(), which gives a floating point exception calling
</I>&gt;<i> pth_mctx_switch() at line 466 of pth_lib.c.  (This is just a macro that
</I>&gt;<i> calls swapcontext() -- see pth_p.h).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My first instinct was that I was probably seeing a libpth problem,
</I>&gt;<i> not a jabberd problem.  But a couple of factors are making this
</I>&gt;<i> seem less likely:
</I>&gt;<i>  1) With the libpth debug, I see that we go through this pth_yield() code
</I>&gt;<i>     many, many times without trouble.
</I>&gt;<i>  2) Using the same libpth, but with jabber 1.2, the problem did not
</I>&gt;<i>     occur.  (same server: AIX 4.3.3, Linux clients running Gabber).
</I>&gt;<i>  3) This happens ONLY when there is a dnsrv read error, and it happens
</I>&gt;<i>     EVERY time there is a dnsrv read error (1-to-1 correspondence); it isn't
</I>&gt;<i>     super common... but I wouldn't say it is rare either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last debug entry from the main jabberd process is always from mio.c
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;calling the connect handler for mio object...&quot; in _mio_connect().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I don't know if I should continue tackling the parent/pth problem,
</I>&gt;<i> or if the problem is really this: why the dnsrv read error in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place?  That is, is it expected as normal that the read will occasionally fail,
</I>&gt;<i> and restarting dnsrv is just a part of normal operation?  Or is it the case
</I>&gt;<i> that the dnsrv read should NOT ever fail, and the restart is just an
</I>&gt;<i> emergency attempt to keep things rolling?  (And if the latter, has anyone
</I>&gt;<i> tested the case of read failure; e.g. break out of the read loop after
</I>&gt;<i> a few dozen reads via a counter and see if things start up OK again)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anybody have any ideas on this?
