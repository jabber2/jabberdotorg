<PRE>&gt;<i> Of important note for people doing this all client side is 
</I>&gt;<i> the wonderful world
</I>&gt;<i> of rate limits and karma.  
</I>
Very true.

&gt;<i> Yes they will eat you up and spit 
</I>&gt;<i> you out if you
</I>&gt;<i> try and do too much.  As a matter of fact these were mostly 
</I>&gt;<i> put in for spammers
</I>&gt;<i> (and those crazy whacky clients that lost control and 
</I>&gt;<i> spazzed).  So you would
</I>&gt;<i> need a server side solution at some point.  
</I>
Unless you're not in a hurry to send those 
messages.  The jabberspam program I wrote
only sends one message per second, which
hopefully is such a small number that no
one would ever notice the increase in message
traffic.  It has a very valid beneficial use
and that is to send messages to users of my
Jabber server whose email addresses I don't
have.  So really it's an admin tool, though
it could possibly be used for evil.

&gt;<i> Of course this 
</I>&gt;<i> won't help spammers
</I>&gt;<i> either because they would have to run it on their own server 
</I>&gt;<i> and s2s traffic
</I>&gt;<i> is limitted.  Lot's of problems lots of solutions.  Someone 
</I>&gt;<i> like to post this
</I>&gt;<i> in the Asylum on the website?
</I>
I just did.  I didn't even know the Asylum 
existed.  Thanks for turning me on to it!


Todd.
