<PRE>Hi Derrick,

Thanks for the feedback. Personally I strive to answer all questions to
which I know the answers, and others on this list do the same, so I'm
sorry that you've felt ignored. Also, please note that this list has
split, so JDEV is now dedicated to discussions of Jabber development as
originally intended, and the new-ish JADMIN list (
<A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/jadmin/">http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/jadmin/</A> ) is dedicated to issues of
installing, configuring, and administering Jabber servers.

That said, I must say I've built the Jabber server on Red Hat 7.0, Red
Hat 6.2, and Debian but have not seen this ports problem. However, I'm
not a Linux/networking guru. I'm wondering if perhaps those ports are
closed and/or busy on this machine? What's the netstat output? Is this
machine behind some kind of restrictive firewall? Which version of
Jabber are we talking about (e.g., built from source or the Red Hat
binaries)? This kind of information would be helpful.

Peter
