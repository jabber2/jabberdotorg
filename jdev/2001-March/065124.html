<PRE>well, the way i see it, the question is not so much if an async.
query can be done over HTTP GET (it cannot doesn't matter how
hard you try). the question is what to add to have this functionality.
platform-dependant propriaty COM? heavy, unnecessarily complicated
java? technocrazy corba implementations? or feather-light-yet-powerfull,
free jabber? it's hard to bet on people using jabber as their
native object broker, but i can tell about at least one guy who
will be happy to use jabber to build interactive-web-applications.
sites that are not viewable with lynx  a r e  being created even
if you'll scream. and it makes a lot of sense. it's not only
stupidly conservative but also anti-productive to discard newer
technologies. people will need  s o m e t h i n g.
jabber can be usefull for the web. both mozilla and internet
explorer can support it easily. other browsers are not being
used in this context.

&gt;<i>Quoting tom berger &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">object at blinx.de</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great idea. only it's not COM/DCOM that should be replaced.
</I>let
&gt;&gt;<i> us leave that to bonobo (actually, is someone already working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on a jabber bonobo control, to replace jabberCOM ? i'm interested)...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what i see, is a bottom-line tool for creating 'web' applications.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my experience with web applications showed me the need for
</I>a
&gt;&gt;<i> simple asynchronous protocol. you see, all the big corp. are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying and trying, and they just cant do. microsoft is doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it the COM way, ibm tries to do it the 'geeky' way, and supports
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linux and java, oracle and sybase, borland, all of them. they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> try to give you the  r e a l   p o w e r   of html (they all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know very little about that, but they learn fast).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when i saw jabberzilla for the first time a few days ago,
</I>all
&gt;&gt;<i> i could think about was that this is something that everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is waiting for since a long time. because on the web, you
</I>cannot
&gt;&gt;<i> really work with flash, java, COM and their friends. you cant,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because you knoe that doesn't matter what you do, you always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end up with 90% protocol. the other 10% is browser bugs and
</I>some
&gt;&gt;<i> content. fot those of you who do not browse the web (especially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the people that do not use a modern browser) : people have
</I>been
&gt;&gt;<i> doing all kind of really bizarre things on the web, utilizing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very simple cgi scripts, some clever javascripting, some basic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> html. all of this, for a simple thing. to run an asyncronous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> query or two.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jabber is nothing like COM. it is simple. and jabber::middleware
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be targeting exactly this niche. the simple, low-tech
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology can really benefit from it, and, it doesn't take
</I>much
&gt;&gt;<i> to get there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple things stick. this is why html became big enough for
</I>people
&gt;&gt;<i> to try using for what it shouldn't be used. i'm sure that
</I>if
&gt;&gt;<i> jabber::middleware will be as simple, you  w i l l  find it
</I>being
&gt;&gt;<i> used as a replacement for corba one day :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I agree with that, and while the thoughts are fresh here are
</I>some specifics i 
&gt;<i>think relate to this issue directly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>For web client applications which want to be compatible with
</I>clients which are 
&gt;<i>stuck behind http proxies then XML-RPC or SOAP is fantastic.
</I> This means a 
&gt;<i>normal HTTP GET can invoke a particular function of a particular
</I>named object 
&gt;<i>on the server and get a response in the reply in a wonderfully
</I>generic manner.  
&gt;<i>This is good for Flash , and Java but i think is an impossible
</I>protocol to 
&gt;<i>implement in Javascript (someone feel free to tell me i'm wrong,
</I>i want to 
&gt;<i>be).  The downside to this interface is that you loose the whole
</I>'presence' 
&gt;<i>idea unless you have a webclient-transport which does timeouts
</I>on inactivity.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any solution proposed should consider clients which interface
</I>through HTTP GET 
&gt;<i>protocol, which I think means that they have less 'features'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Just thoughts, Oliver.
