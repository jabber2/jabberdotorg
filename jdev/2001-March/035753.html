<PRE>Dave,

&gt;<i> This is exactly the subject I have been interested in of late, and
</I>&gt;<i> have start investigating in a serious manner.. I've taken a first
</I>&gt;<i> stab at gathering requirements for just such a project:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dizzyd.manilasites.com/stories/storyReader$15">http://dizzyd.manilasites.com/stories/storyReader$15</A>
</I>
Nice site, you're definatly off to a good start!  I'm very interested in what
you have documented so far, and definatly interested in getting a project like
this going.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2. What protocol would be the recommended method of handling the style of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; query I mentioned?
</I>
&gt;<i> Well, I'm investigating the use of XMLRPC and/or SOAP. Either one would be 
</I>&gt;<i> good -- tho I tend to lean towards XMLRPC.
</I>
Well, after some research that I've been doing over the last few days, I might
agree with that too.  In addition to various other reasons, XML-RPC seems much
simpler, which is the basis for much of the Jabber architecture.  Also, as I
saw after following a link on your site, DJ Adams has already written a Perl
module for doing XML-RPC over Jabber.  And to top it off, as seen on Slashdot,
ESR supports XML-RPC.. who can argue with that? ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Speed -- upon proposing a system like this, the first question my boss
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; asked was what kind of performance hit were we going to take for having a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributed system.
</I>
&gt;<i> Well, Jabber _does_ use XML -- and that's gonna inflict a little bit of added
</I>&gt;<i> processing time for each packet. However, the j.org's server can handle up
</I>&gt;<i> to 500 msgs/sec (benchmarked back in December) so that should be fast enough
</I>&gt;<i> for what you need. Of note, j.com's implementation of the server handles
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of msgs/sec.
</I>
Hmmm... 500 msgs/sec isn't bad.  And if that doesn't make them happy, I'm sure
we could splurge for the commercial server.

Now, part of the problem with XML may be the size of the packet you end up with
after you get 100 good sized database records in it.  Which would be slower --
a 500K XML packet being sent from one application to another over 10MB
ethernet, or on-the-fly gzip compression to compress the message before it's
sent?  I'm just wondering if there would be a benefit to compressing
particulary large packets.  I'm referring to compressing the message within the
Jabber packet (the XML-RPC/SOAP stuff), not the entire thing.

&gt;<i> All that aside, I would also question whether retrieving
</I>&gt;<i> a full record for every keystroke is the optimial setup -- so with a few
</I>&gt;<i> optimizations on your system, it's totally possible that using Jabber could
</I>&gt;<i> be as fast as using something more estoric like CORBA/COM. 
</I>
Well, I'm not entirely disagreeing with you here, but the implementation
belongs to my boss.  So, whether good or bad, thats the way it's going to stay
unless I can delicatly demonstrate a better way :-)  Not to pick on him though,
he is very open to better ideas.

&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Just to have some comparisons, what are your opinions on why a system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like this using Jabber would be better then something like Oracle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Application Server, xmlBlaster, and other such products?  And if Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't the right tool here, what is?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I'm not familiar with those other products. Perhaps the biggest
</I>&gt;<i> advantages that Jabber would bring would be:
</I>&gt;<i>  * Cost -- it's free! :)
</I>&gt;<i>  * Ease-of-use -- the protocl is fairly simple and can be read by a human; no
</I>&gt;<i>                   weird IDL compilers or binary syntax/protocol to deal with
</I>
Free is good :-)  And you'll get no arguement from me about not needing bother
with IDL compilers.  Not to mention trying to figure out how to handle such a
beast in a cross platform way.  I haven't run across many CORBA implementations
that claim to be cross platform, free, and have hooks into most programming
languages.  Now, I know some different CORBA implementations can interoperate,
but how much work will it take to figure out which those are.. and what happens
if we discover they don't work 6 months after beginning development?

In any case, assuming nobody has a case to use CORBA, I will gladly cross that
off the list.

&gt;<i> Again, I truly believe a sub-project should start gathering requirements and
</I>&gt;<i> working towards utilizing Jabber just for such an application. Please take a
</I>&gt;<i> look at what I've started and let's see if we can build a nice big snowball.
</I>
Well, count me in.  I definatly think it's possible to do all this without
modifying Jabber at all.  However, Dave mentions (on his website, see the
previous message in this thread) a few ideas that Jabber might be able to
implement that could make Jabber a more robust middleware application.  His
ideas include message queueing, message timeouts/retry, and so on.  I definatly
feel these would be appropriate, but maybe somebody more knowledgable then
myself could take a look at his page and discuss why to or why not to implement
such ideas.

Anyhow, I hope we can get something rolling here, I definatly can see a big
opportunity with this.  Comments welcome.  Thanks,
  -Eric
