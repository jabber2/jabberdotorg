<PRE>&gt;<i> The more I think about it the more I love the idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It also highlights my least favourite part of jabber and offers a better 
</I>&gt;<i> solution.
</I>
Yes yes yes.. this is what the JAM project is all about!  As soon as
somebody (HINT HINT) gets the JAM forum set up, we can talk about
requirements, and get this stuff coded into Jabber!

&gt;<i> I think interfacing say the chat transport through iq/set should not be an 
</I>&gt;<i> obscure flat naming thing (insert flame here) but instead should be an object 
</I>&gt;<i> oriented interface to a series of functions.  What i'm trying to say is that 
</I>&gt;<i> the interface should be XML-RPC across the jabber network.  
</I>
Check out what Dave Smith has to say at this page:

<A HREF="http://dizzyd.manilasites.com/stories/storyReader$15">http://dizzyd.manilasites.com/stories/storyReader$15</A>

Thats only the start of things though.  We're going to add on to that and
really get the ball rolling here.  Do you have any suggestions for
requirements, and any specific cases you would like to use it for?

&gt;<i> so notionally i might call functions on the chat transport by sending
</I>&gt;<i> an iq/set 
</I>
On the website, Dave discusses reasons to use a new Jabber::Middleware
protocol.  We could definatly overload the current system to work, but he
felt there would be advantages to setting up an entire new protocol for
the job.  Any thoughts?

&gt;<i> Obviously this can be done already but it is the jabber way to standardise... 
</I>&gt;<i> has this train of though come up before?
</I>
Until we get a forum of our own (and I'll keep whining about this until
you get it set up.. you know who you are ;-), I'll keep track of the
requirements people are looking for.  But there has been a lot of people
interested in an idea like this, both on and off this list.. and a lot of
them have already contributed some pretty neat ideas.  Lets hear yours!
Be specific :-)  Thanks,
  -Eric
