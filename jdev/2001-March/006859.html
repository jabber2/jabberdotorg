<PRE>(I brought this up within an earlier message but I think it's worth 
raising to a separate thread, esp. since I got no answers / comments.)

The 'oob' namespace seems to be Jabber's current answer for direct 
peer-to-peer communications, particularly file transfer. However, the 
documentation I've seen is really vague and leaves me with worries about 
its reliability and security. Let me list the problems I see, together 
with some possible solutions.

Also, have any clients implemented file transfer or other oob 
communications yet?

As I understand it the flow of control looks like this:
* Sender opens a TCP port on its host and listens for HTTP connections 
on it.
* Sender sends a Jabber message to receiver with an 'oob'-namespace 
element containing an HTTP URL pointing to its own IP address and the 
opened port.
* Receiver initiates an HTTP download via the URL.
* Sender gets the HTTP connection on the port it opened and sends the 
file data.
* Both sides close the connection, and the sender stops listening on 
that port.

Major concern.
This does not work if the sender is behind any sort of a firewall and/or 
a NAT (network address translation) service. This applies to me 
personally both at home and at work. It does however support the 
receiver being behind any sort of firewall that allows HTTP connections 
(though the receiver's client may need to go through an HTTP proxy 
server.)
It also relies on the sender giving out its IP address, which many 
people are loath to do for security reasons.

This can be addressed by allowing the sender's Jabber server to act as a 
proxy: the message is rewritten to include a URL pointing to the server, 
and the server then proxies the incoming request through to the sender. 
This does of course require additional smarts on the part of the server, 
as well as placing additional bandwidth demands on it (but no more than 
the kinds of demands that are currently made on HTTP proxies, for 
instance.)

Secondary concern.
I'm unsure how a secure association can be made on the sender between 
the outgoing file transfer offer and the incoming HTTP request. The 
sender generally wants to be sure that only the specific entity the 
message was sent to can download the file, not some random other entity 
that may be probing the sender's machine for open ports.

This can be addressed in a weak way by using a random port number, but 
since only 64536 numbers are generally available, that's not very secure.

Stronger security could be obtained via regular HTTP authentication, by 
adding a username and (randomly generated) password to the URL.

Of course, for greatest security, the entire message containing the URL 
would have to be encrypted to guard against interception.

Third (tertiary?) concern.
The receiver may well decide not to download the file at all (especially 
if it's named something like &quot;sexy_babes.exe&quot;.) There doesn't seem to be 
any defined mechanism for the receiver's client to indicate to the 
sender that this has occurred.
This means that the sender's client has to keep listening on that port 
until some kind of time-out occurs, and the sender him/herself may get 
confused wondering when the receiver is going to get around to receiving 
the file.

Looks like there ought to be some kind of standard reply message type 
indicating a refusal to download the file, so the sender's client can 
close the port and present a GUI notification.
