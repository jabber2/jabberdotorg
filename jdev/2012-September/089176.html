<PRE>Hello Friends,

I am exploring ideas on how to keep multiple connected resources of a user in sync with chat conversations.

Consider this simple example:
1) User-A have two resource connected a.k.a. User-A/Home and User-A/Work
2) User-A is in conversation with User-B and as per standard workflow User-A/Work resource has been locked in
3) Now suppose User-A leaves work place and wants to continue conversation with User-B from home
4) However, User-A/Home client have no idea about the chat conversations happened between User-A/Work and User-B
5) For&#160;convenience&#160;of &#160;User-A we would like to have a sync up of these chat conversations

Some Possible Solutions:
1) With no server side archival policy, one solution is to relay chat messages even to non-locked in user resources so that they are always in-sync in realtime2) With no server side archival policy, serve 1-2-1 conversations via a pubsub node or muc room so that all user resources are always in-sync
3) With server side archival policy, non-locked in resources can do a sync when user becomes active on those clients

Has anyone worked on a similar use case?
I will be glad to hear how others have solved such use cases.
What are pros/cons of a different approaches assuming this will be&#160;implemented&#160;for millions of user in our system.

Cheers,
