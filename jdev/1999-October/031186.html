<PRE>Quoting Patrick McCuller &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">patrick at kia.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt;   Problem.  The X Consortium is an official entity that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legally recognized.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The 'Jabber Team' is not.
</I>&gt;<i> 	I don't know what you might mean by 'legally recognized'. People are
</I>&gt;<i> legally recognized. So are dogs and houses. Estates, trusts, corporations,
</I>&gt;<i> commonwealths, states, and verbal agreements all exist arguably without
</I>&gt;<i> having a physical body at all. They are dealt with and recognized by law
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> judicial process.
</I>
  Your dog cannot enter into a legally binding contract.  Neither can a group 
of people.  My friends and I cannot sigh a contract as 'Friends of TCharron'.  
Jabber.org really REALLY is a 'club'.  Just like I can't sue the 'Jabber 
Team'.  Good rule of thumb.  If you can sue them, they're recognized.

&gt;<i> Even totally illegal organizations - organized crime,
</I>&gt;<i> criminal gangs, drug cartels, and the like - are legally recognized as
</I>&gt;<i> independant entities.
</I>
  Hrm..  So why not just sue a mob for breach of contract?  Becouse you can't 
simply throw peoples names down.

&gt;<i> 	However, all of this argument is totally moot. Lawyers exist (I have
</I>&gt;<i> personally known lawyers to exist) to create legalese documents such as
</I>&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;<i> 	I suggest the Webb or Corel people put their money where their mouthes 
</I>are
&gt;<i> and donate some general counsel time to the Jabber cause, to the extent
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber contributors have questions about the destiny of the fruits of their
</I>&gt;<i> works, and if this is even neccessary.
</I>
  This would be nice.  A Jabber Foundation of some sort..
