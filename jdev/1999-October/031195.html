<PRE>&gt;<i> At least in Michigan, I don't think it is possible to have a Not for

There is another option that may be significantly less money and is quite a
bit easy to do.

LLC's (Limited Liability Companies) are now available in most states and
when I was researching it cost about half of that of a Subchapter S.

Its actually like a Limited Liability General Partnership.  Ownership and
shares are a harder to manage than a standard corporation, but may be worth
doing.
