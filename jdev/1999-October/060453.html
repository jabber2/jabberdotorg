&gt;<i> First off, I certainly hope that my last post wasn't considered a
</I>&gt;<i> _dumb_ post.  I'm only trying to help, and I certainly don't feel
</I>&gt;<i> that it was noise.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Oh jeez, no! Summaries are wonderful and though a couple points were weird,
that is by no means a &quot;dumb&quot; post! I don't feel it was noise either!

&gt;<i> &gt;We cannot assume TCP/IP and &quot;normal&quot; timestamping. Jabbertransport uses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;TCP/IP and that's the extent of the reliablity issue we can go. etherx uses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;TCP/IP, true, but udpx or 6782x might not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, my apologies, I thought TCP/IP could be assumed.  This brings up 
</I>&gt;<i> another
</I>&gt;<i> issue for me though, and that is, what if a closed network runs IPX or some 
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> yet conceived protocol?  Should we perhaps add a layer of abstraction in those
</I>&gt;<i> codebases to seperate the delivery mechanism?  Just a thought.  I do realise 
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> would add a significant amount of overhead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
etherx (or rather, the JabberBox protocol) is reliable. Future protocols may
not be. Though, code wise, we're treating the system as &quot;reliable&quot;, this may
not always be the case.

The abstraction layer you want is, etherx! (*x) Currently transports connect
via TCP/IP, however in 0.7 a form of IPC is being used to remove the network
communication aspect.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; UNLESS the sender is traversing timezones between messages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Happens to me. Happened to jer. It happens all the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How then can we rely on any timezone information supplied by the client?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The &quot;solution&quot; idea proposed was just to have everyone run with UTC and thus
not worry about passed TZ information.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I think it would be useful if we constructed this discussion in a more 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; high-level manner.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Already have. You're just reiterating.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Taken as a whole, I suppose we have.  My hope was that we
</I>&gt;<i> could do it in a clearer, more intuitive manner.  Perhaps my reiteration
</I>&gt;<i> (and Waleed's summaries) was an attempt in that direction.  Clearly restating
</I>&gt;<i> the issues has been very useful to me in the past in eliminating redundant
</I>&gt;<i> discussions and streamlining decision making.  Upon re-reading your proposal
</I>&gt;<i> I can see that we are futher along than I thought.  Again, my apologies are 
</I>&gt;<i> due
</I>&gt;<i> for contributing to redundancy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You summarized, and I was a bit harsh. Large numbers of useless (julian?)
posts are painful for me.

&gt;<i> Back to lurker mode...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Don't! You contribute, and contribute well! As a team, we need more people
like you.
