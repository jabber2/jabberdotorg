  I tend to agree as well.  Basically, the first tag would have no recieved 
date, only a sent date, and would contain the client data..

</I>
  Yea, I/Q is kinda hazy about this.  I'd say we'd still need the data on ever 
single stamp, becouse the sending client also has no way of knowing that the 
client recieving the message already knows the timezone data.

&gt;<i> These are different, but similiar. The timestamp could be modified by

</I>
  I like that idea.  Basically, the first entry in route would be the sending 
client.  But I'd have to say we really need to include the TZ in every message 
for it to be reliable.  Neither end can really tell what's going to happen.
