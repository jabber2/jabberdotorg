It seems to me that your objective is to make the protocol itself
completely open to use by anyone for anything.  I don't think you should
leave this to chance, as would happen if you simply omitted any discussion
of a license.

I suggest using a similar copyright notice / permission grant to the one
the X Window System Consortium used, so that your intent is clear, and
remains clear.

Here's a paraphrase of the X notice that might be suitable for the purpose
of Jabber's protocol specification.
