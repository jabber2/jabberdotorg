Agreed. Either way is acceptable, but I favor the first, for the reason
stated below.

&gt;<i>

</I>
Some people did not like this, as timezone may change between
messages,and the recieving client would hae no way of knowing when to
update. 
That is why I am in favor what I previously wrote, where the sending
client would modify it's timestamp tag (or whatever) including it's
timezone _when it had changed_
This would be placed on only the first timestamp, which would be sent by
the client.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> the client..  We can tag it at the start, but the only reliable way would be to
</I>&gt;<i> have it in one of the I/Q tables..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
These are different, but similiar. The timestamp could be modified by
the client, as I had said, to includ the timezone. This might be more
appropiate somewhere else, however.
