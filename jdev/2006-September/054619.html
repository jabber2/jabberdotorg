Essentially, you're trying to suspend your subscription to their 
presence. You could do this by unsubscribing and resubscribing, but 
obviously this will cause your contacts to have to permit you to 
subscribe again.

I don't think there's anything within the protocol that would allow 
you to suspend your contacts presence, but I'm curious as to exactly 
what your aim is here - receiving message stanzas will still require 
you to keep the data connection up, and the TCP session open, so 
unless there's a really substantial amount of traffic caused by 
presence stanzas, you're going to have much the same battery drain.

Transmission is the big battery cost, and the incoming presence 
stanzas will just cause a few TCP level ACKs.

I would guess that it's quite likely that a stanza sent to suspend 
and unsuspend presence subscriptions would cost more in terms of 
battery than you'd save, and it would also hurt usability 
dramatically, as you'd inadvertantly be sending messages to people 
who might be busy, or even offline.

Dave.
