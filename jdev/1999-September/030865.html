<PRE>This is just an informational message to give everyone an idea of where we
are at on the road to 0.7.

First I'll mention documentation.  <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/">http://docs.jabber.org/</A> is starting to
come together nicely, but is still missing some important documents.  Here
is what I've been working on in this area:

Note: I've tried to draw a clear separation between the documents
describing the fundamental structural components and the documentation on
our implementation and code that uses those components.  

=&gt; Structural (design/specification docs)
	XML Streams
	Jabber Identifiers
	Message
	Presence
	Info/Query

=&gt; Implementation
	Jabber Architecture Overview
	Client-Server details
	Etherx
	Server (internals, module API, etc)
	Jlib

Some of this has started to make it's way to the docs web site, but much
of it isn't there yet.  My goal is to have all of these documents started
and online by the end of the month.  They will not be complete for some
time yet, but there should be enough there to get started within the next
week.


Now, code!  The core of the 0.7 effort is jlib and that has been
progressing nicely.  Currently it will compile and build, the xmlnode
functionality is nearly 100% complete and the threaded listen/sockets and
xmlstreams are operational and nearing completion.  There are other
aspects of jlib that need much work yet, but this base is enough to start
building on.  If you want to get involved with this check out the
jlib.jabber.org team and join the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">lib-dev at jabber.org</A> list.

This week my focus is going to be on getting the frameworks in place for
the 0.7 etherx, jabber server, and a basic transport.  By this weekend the
framework should be ready and they should be *somewhat* operational.  
Watch for news on the etherx and server team lists!

I'd like to do a 0.7 &quot;developer release&quot; next week, by the end of the
month.  The developer release would have all of the needed libraries,
code(libs, etherx, server, and possibly early icq and aim transports), and
documents in one package that would at least compile and run enough to
test out.  Depending on how the developer release goes, do a 0.7
feature-complete test release a few weeks following that and a final 0.7
shortly after that as it stabilizes.

There is lots of activity within different team sites and lists that you
don't see here on jdev, so if you are interested in any other aspect of
Jabber please join the respective teams and lists:
