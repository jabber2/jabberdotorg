<PRE>[Note: this is crossposted to a few lists, please respond only to the
specific list relevant to your reply]

To summarize things up quickly, this is what my plan is for 0.7.

There are 4 phases that need to happen for a 0.7 release:
=&gt; libjabber
=&gt; etherx
=&gt; jabber transport/server
=&gt; modules

libjabber is starting to shape up.  By this weekend I'll have it building
and have enough of the core API operational to start work on things that
depend on libjabber.  As everything progresses, libjabber will continue to
stabilize and the APIs will mature.

Two big projects for this weekend are to get a framework up for the 0.7
etherx and move much of the 0.6 base into it.  There's not a lot of
complexity in it, so I'd like to have etherx building/running by early
next week.

After I know how etherx is going to work out, I'll be creating a simple
transport &quot;template&quot; that will help get the jabber, icq, and aim
transports started.  Starting early next week once etherx is running, most
of my focus will be on the jabber transport.  If all goes well, a
rudimentary jabber transport will be operational by the following weekend
and we can get a few basic modules working within it.

*whew*, that's a ton to do in the next two weeks but I think it's
possible.  Assuming there are no major roadblocks, I'd like to see another
couple of weeks to fill in some of the missing features and make sure it's
rock solid stable, then release 0.7 before the end of the month.

Note to client authors:  If possible, it would be *really* nice to have a
good set of working clients available at the same time that 0.7 is
released.  Don't hold up your development on the 0.7 server, the 0.6
server should be more than adequate for basic client development purposes.
