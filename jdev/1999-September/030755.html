*Systems* may be required to be all things to all people. That does
not mean that Jabber needs to solve all these problems. When the time
comes, let us start a project to do presence stuff.

The people at the pulver.com meeting were mainly from the commercial
world, right? Their software/hardware needs to solve all problems,
or the buyer will take his/her money elsewhere, right? That is why MS
Word does all things but nothing well.

We don't need to reason like that. Our software is free. If there is
need for a presence mechanism, it will be done. If Jabber is well
established at the time, it will very likely be the platform a
presence project will start out from. If they make persuasive a
argument that Jabber itself needs extension, we will do it then. In my
opinion, the OSS community has proved again and again that integrating
or extending free software is rarely difficult where there is a real
need.

In short, let's take one thing at a time. Don't worry so much if we're
doing the right thing. We can worry about that when we're done. Let us
keep an open mind and focus on the goal.

Don't read me wrong. I don't say that we shouldn't think about presence
or any other part of the Universe Jabber may come into contact with. I
just want to say: &quot;Think about this - *then* go forth and conquer!&quot;

And we who listen to the sky, or walk the dusty grade,
Or break the very atoms down, to see how they are made,
Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand;
The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand.
