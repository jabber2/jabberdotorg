Yes, the clients have to know XML. The whole protocol is based off of
XML so it kinda makes sense that the clients have to know it...

&gt;<i> &lt;!-- keep in the mind iscoming from a perl view --&gt; This would mean

</I>
There is no such problem with reading a single byte at a time. I read
whatever I get from the server and send it to expat. Expat deals with
what it gets. When it sees that first &lt;/message&gt; it has gotten a
&lt;message&gt; before it (heh, at least it better have) and the data in
between has stored in confusing structures that I can use, but don't
understand fully ;) That &lt;/message&gt; causes expat to call the end element
handler, which is where I take a look at the tag.

At the &quot;topmost&quot; level, I look for the &quot;major&quot; tags, like roster. Then
those go to the handler for that type of tag. Those handlers know about
types of tags that can be inside their enclosing tag.

If you were to write an XML parser yourself I imagine it would be no fun
at all, but expat works very well. It handles the messy stuff.
