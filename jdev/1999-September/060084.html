&gt;<i> Just Curious, what if a persons home server goes down and they no longer
</I>&gt;<i> have access to it for weeks on end, what do they do? [tear]
</I>
They get it connected again!

In a more serious tone, since this is a &quot;home server&quot; we must assume it isn't
the most reliable system. ;) I would like a clearer definition of &quot;home
server&quot; though. My &quot;home server&quot; will be an tunneling etherx with a &quot;guise&quot;
transport connected.

&gt;<i> [tear] Why not create the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to mirror a server elsewhere and then the client can pick it up,
</I>
Mirror a server then a client can pick it up. What we're talking about it
fault tolerance. People spend _money_ on fault tolerance. What you want is a
&quot;network&quot; fault tolerance system where messages are queued up on other
servers in case yours is down.

I would like to take this point to point out we're talking about INSTANT
MESSAGING. We're a instant messaging and presense system. If you're not
online, it's a feature of jabbertransport to record your message. It is NOT
part of the protocol, nor is it to be expected. If your server is down, thus
you are down.

If I was to simplify your statement, it says &quot;why not have a server where a
client can connect.&quot; 'Nuff said. If you want guaranteed queuing, the SMTP
network seems to be working.

&gt;<i> [tear] I'm
</I>&gt;<i> still unsure how the back end of the servers work to transfer message
</I>&gt;<i> between each other is it relayed like IRC or is just standalon that connedt
</I>&gt;<i> to the specific server on a whim? [tear]
</I>
docs.jabber.org

&gt;<i> [tear] if it was relayed you caould set it up to
</I>&gt;<i> allow them to log onto any server and have them send a special homeserver
</I>&gt;<i> tag to grab the mirror.
</I>
Which I point to above in MY server setup. Of course, that special &quot;home
server&quot; seems to be remarkably similar to a normal client...
