<PRE>Maybe I can help a little.....heh heh you owe me Jer :)

The &quot;XML for everything&quot; is just the format that was chosen - I can give you
several reasons why it is a good system, though I can't prove if it is
better than any other propritary system....here goes:

1. The XML archeticture is totally expandable - that is, new tags and data
can be easily added by new markup.

2. The &quot;local server&quot; system similar to email would probobly become to
cumbersome for proprietary systems since a lot of those systems use
low-level calls, not text-based data like Jabber.

3. The client development is much smoother and easier because it is
standardized XML - and not just by Jabber, but by W3C and other internet
standard groups.

4. The future of appilcations will probobly be XML-based. For instance,
based on some IETF discussions recently, XML or some FORM of XML may become
used to appliances and computers to talk together....kinda weird but true :)

Hope this helps!

Josh

&gt;&gt;<i> I still don't really have an answer to my original question (see above).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not trying to be a pest, but I just want to understand the ideas behide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the decisions that have been made regarding Jabber.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry 'bout that...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's really difficult to come up with a good answer, since many of us have
</I>&gt;<i> built and deployed solutions with XML at the core that the answer is so
</I>&gt;<i> intimately part of us we just &quot;feel&quot; it :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd say start by reading up on XML, many of the goals for the design
</I>&gt;<i> of XML are synonimous for the goals of Jabber.  Check out xml.com and
</I>&gt;<i> w3.org, they have pointers to some decent XML resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly though, the question &quot;why did we choose to use XML in Jabber&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> isn't appropriate since Jabber is fundamentally an XML-based real-time
</I>&gt;<i> architecture.  XML wasn't a choice, but was the foundation of the entire
</I>&gt;<i> project.
