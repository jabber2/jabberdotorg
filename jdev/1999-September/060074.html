I started putting on together last night, it'll connect to the .6
servers fine and can send raw commands but doesn't yet &quot;hear&quot;
data that gets sent back to it. This is my first attempt at
networking so I'm just diving in.

My Open Transport code that I'm using is a library a friend of
mine just wrote. I don't yet know if it's all I need, but it's
given me a place to start.

As a note for people interested in mac clients, I don't think I'm
aiming for backwards compatibility with pre-OT and
pre-Appearance. This is a project of mine to learn OT and do
something I'm interested in. :) Oh, and yes I did have my own OT
code before I got my friends library, so I'm not ditching the
learning about OT part :)
