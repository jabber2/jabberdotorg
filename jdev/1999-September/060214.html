Sorry 'bout that... 

It's really difficult to come up with a good answer, since many of us have
built and deployed solutions with XML at the core that the answer is so
intimately part of us we just &quot;feel&quot; it :)

I'd say start by reading up on XML, many of the goals for the design
of XML are synonimous for the goals of Jabber.  Check out xml.com and
w3.org, they have pointers to some decent XML resources.

Honestly though, the question &quot;why did we choose to use XML in Jabber&quot;
isn't appropriate since Jabber is fundamentally an XML-based real-time
architecture.  XML wasn't a choice, but was the foundation of the entire
project.
