<PRE>[Note: this might be a bit difficult to grok if you are not familiar with
the protocol, the server/transport architecture, and the concept of user
sessions within one account]

There are two main types of interfaces for instant messaging: message
style (popup window per mssage) and chat style (line by line in one
window).  Jabber doesn't place any restrictions on clients as far as how
they would display messages, but it might be useful to convey which style
is in use between clients.  A user may react or approach the conversation
differently when in chat style versus message style, so it is particularly
useful to flag that one client is in &quot;chat mode&quot; so that the other client
may also display the conversation in chat style.

I think it would be safe to utilize the type=&quot;&quot; attribute on the message
tag for this purpose.  When a user is utilizing the chat interface, the
message could be sent:
  &lt;message type=&quot;chat&quot;&gt;
    &lt;to&gt;joe&lt;/to&gt;
    &lt;say&gt;Hey joe,&lt;/say&gt;
  &lt;/message&gt;
The receiving client could then optionally display the message in a chat
style interface.

This is just a solution for 2-way chats, no different than normal instant
messages but simply displayed differently to the user.  There also needs
to be a solution for group chats which have an interface similiar to
popular IRC clients (chat window with right sidebar listing participants).

The Jabber protocol doesn't have any concept of a group chat, but that
doesn't mean it can't be done within the existing protocol/architecture.
To impliment group chat in the existing architecture, you need to have a
transport that manages the group chat.  This transport might be just for
group chats between jabber users, or it might be a gateway to an IRC
network, but it would technically work the same way.

What happens is that the group is assigned a jabber ID, such as
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">buddies at groups.jabber.org</A>, where the transport &quot;groups.jabber.org&quot; manages
the chat.  All incoming messages are reflected out by the transport to the
participants, and every participant in the chat is assigned a nickname
under that jabber ID.  So, if I join the buddies chat and send a message,
the participants in the chat might get something like this:
  &lt;message type=&quot;groupchat&quot;&gt;
    &lt;from nick=&quot;Jer&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">buddies at groups.jabber.org</A>&lt;/from&gt;
    &lt;say&gt;:-)&lt;/say&gt;
  &lt;/message&gt;

As you can see, the type of the message is &quot;groupchat&quot; which flags the
client to display it in a group chat interface, and each participant is
identified as a seperate nickanme under the group ID.  Also, when you join
a chat or change your status within the chat (away, ops, etc) the
transport managing the group would send out a status to all of the
participants.  All clients would receive a status message for each
participant, and would use that to display the list of chatting users in
the right sidebar.

There would also be a complimentary set of queries that the transport
would support for group chats, such as joining, leaving, etc.  These
queries will need to be determined as we impliment the first IRC or group
transport and have clients supporting type=&quot;groupchat&quot;.

We don't want to go crazy and try to make this the all-encompasing IRC
client or add in all the possible features that other systems have, but
just attempt to find a simple and balanced approach that provides the
basic functionality for everyone to take advantage of.
