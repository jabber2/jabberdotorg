<PRE>&gt;<i> I imagine there is a CVS archive, where is it? The cvs page is not filled
</I>&gt;<i> in; the Quickstart page also had no information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is in the CVS archive right now? What projects are going on?
</I>
Each team has a different archive for it's codebase, but many of the team
pages don't mention this yet.  Until they are all updated, ask on the list
or as the team administrators.  I'll also update the CVS doc and FAQ to
reflect this.

&gt;<i> I have a rather large amount of experience with C++ and relatively low
</I>&gt;<i> amounts in java and networking code, I have been interested in developing or
</I>&gt;<i> helping to develop a IM client for quite a while (thinking about something
</I>&gt;<i> like a java applet so that you can log in from anywhere) . I also am on the
</I>&gt;<i> IMPP list.
</I>
Great!  We can use help everywhere :)

&gt;<i> I guess what I am wondering is, how can I find out where everyone is, what
</I>&gt;<i> projects are going around, how I can help, etc.
</I>
Well, the developer quickstart attempts to answer this but it's still
missing a good deal because of the ra[pid growth of the project recently.
Let me know any particular things that it's missing or lacking information
on and you think should be added and I'll fix it up.

Otherwise, just pick a team (<A HREF="http://jabber.org/developers/teams.jab">http://jabber.org/developers/teams.jab</A>), join
it and jump on it's dev list, and start asking questions :)
