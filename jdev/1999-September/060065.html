  Exactly what I meant when I said 'In a different transport'.  The presence transport will NEED to be there, or else Jabber will die in 18 months, when the 'official' interoperability protocol will come out.

&gt;<i>The people at the pulver.com meeting were mainly from the commercial

</I>&gt;<i>or the buyer will take his/her money elsewhere, right? That is why MS

</I>
  Isn't that what we're doing, though?  The 'unified IM platform' sounds like we're being pretty all things to me.. ;-P

&gt;<i>We don't need to reason like that. Our software is free. If there is
</I>&gt;<i>need for a presence mechanism, it will be done. If Jabber is well

</I>&gt;<i>opinion, the OSS community has proved again and again that integrating
</I>&gt;<i>or extending free software is rarely difficult where there is a real
</I>&gt;<i>need.
</I>
  My point was not that we need to follow the lead of the companies.  My point was that I believe that this is something that jabber will need.

&gt;<i>In short, let's take one thing at a time. Don't worry so much if we're
</I>&gt;<i>doing the right thing. We can worry about that when we're done. Let us
</I>&gt;<i>keep an open mind and focus on the goal.
</I>
  No offense, but 'don't worry if we're doing it the right way' sounds pretty silly.  I'm guessing I'm taking this further then you meant, but it comes accross poorly, to be honest..

&gt;<i>Don't read me wrong. I don't say that we shouldn't think about presence
</I>&gt;<i>or any other part of the Universe Jabber may come into contact with. I
</I>&gt;<i>just want to say: &quot;Think about this - *then* go forth and conquer!&quot;
</I>
  Thinking about it is why I brought it up.. ;-P
