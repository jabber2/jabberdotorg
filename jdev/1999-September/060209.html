<PRE>Just a couple of responses that I knew I could help with..

It seems as though a lot of people have the same feelings.. I've talked to
more than a couple of people who have said that they were about to start a
new IM system, but then they found Jabber..

&gt;<i> What about encrypted messages?  Will that be possible?
</I>
Answered in the User FAQ.

&gt;<i> One thing I really wanted to have with my system is a way for the
</I>&gt;<i> server to store most, if not all, the users configuration (client
</I>&gt;<i> list at least) so that when the user decides to install another

</I>&gt;<i> to run on the same machine, logged in as two users (say, if I'm at my
</I>&gt;<i> friend's house, and we both want to be available for chat).
</I>
The FAQ talks about this as well. The list of contacts (Roster) is all
stored on the server. And of course you can have more than one client on
one machine.. I usually have a zABBER (tk/tcl) client running with the
nick &quot;zABBER&quot; and then cabbar (GTK+) running with the nick &quot;cabbar.&quot; Both
of these are under my name and whichever client has the highest priority
gets the messages (or someone can send a message directly to one of the
clients if they wish). There is also no difficulty in loading two clients
with completely different users.. I do that at my friends house often as
well.

Hope I helped somewhat.. I may need to clarify the client thing in the
FAQ. I will check on that and possibly update it.
