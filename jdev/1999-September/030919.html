<PRE>&gt;<i> You mention the server auto forwarding via a transport to other devices. Can
</I>&gt;<i> presence information be feed (from transports) to a central points for
</I>&gt;<i> determination of what to do. Is the server designed to handle determination
</I>&gt;<i> of best method of contactability. I leave my PC on all day (hence maybe
</I>&gt;<i> logged in) but I'm not always at mydesk but I have my mobile with me.(also
</I>&gt;<i> SMS enabled)  The client may notify of an instant contactability timeout
</I>&gt;<i> period .
</I>
Yes, the server will do determination of which &quot;path&quot; to the user is the
best path.  For the first run here with 0.7 it will use a simple priority
integer, your current location's resource would have the highest integer.
We might need something more complex in the future, but this simple
priority will work to experiment with.

&gt;<i> Also given the above. I was taking nickname to be like  someone's &quot;role&quot; ie
</I>&gt;<i> work or home and hence different levels of contactability for each rather
</I>&gt;<i> than a contactability device / resource. There may be different rosters for
</I>&gt;<i> each of these roles.
</I>
Yes, of course, any &quot;resource&quot; could and would often be their
nickname/role for their sessions and each resource would be a different
level of contactability.  One of the things that needs to be addressed
within the presence system is how to express the &quot;type&quot; of resource it is
so that other clients can provide some sort of visual representation that
a particular resource is a device, pager, live session, etc.

Also, on the different rosters for the different roles, I hope that the
roster info/query exchange would support each resource having different
default rosters but I haven't decided on the syntax just yet.

&gt;<i> I see this as important particularly in line with IMPP model and ubiquitous
</I>&gt;<i> IM. All of this requires serverside processing.
</I>
Absolutely, I'd like to stay as close to the IMPP model as possible, so
that it is easier to adopt the protocol when it is available.

Let me know if I didn't answer any of your questions or misunderstood
them,

Jer
