OK, now I'm really confused! I was working from the JPG and getting 
mixed up about some of the examples. Then temas told me &quot;that's old; 
look at the Generic Conferencing docs instead&quot;. So I started 
implementing that. But from what you're saying, it seems that it's not 
implemented yet.

Also, the JPO [1.6.6] describes the jabber:iq:conference namespace for 
generic conferencing, which seems to be basically the same stuff that 
the proposal describes.

So if I want my client to work today with existing groupchat/conference 
servers, what protocol should I implement?

&gt;<i> I'm currently working on a new draft for 'Generic Conferencing', with a 
</I>&gt;<i> number of changes[...]
</I>
Could I see the new draft and perhaps comment on it? (Actually, I'm 
about to leave on vacation for two weeks, so if you plan on posting it 
before 5/13, just ignore this request.)

&gt;<i> You could both have a non-persistant room in which the last person out 
</I>&gt;<i> turns off the light, or a persistant room which is always there in some 
</I>&gt;<i> form or another.
</I>
Good! Presumably the persistence is a flag specified in the 
jabber:iq:conference query that creates the room?

&gt;<i> One of the things I'd also like to start rolling on is an 
</I>&gt;<i> 'invitation-only'-type room. There would be an invitation list 
</I>&gt;<i> maintained, and only people invited to the room could join.
</I>
I am very interested in such a feature. Basically, a persistent room 
with invitation-only semantics where you can get a list of all members 
[whether or not they're currently present] is a big step toward a form 
of virtual community.
