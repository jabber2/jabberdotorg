<PRE>Sorry, I may have rushed to judgement, but I still think that totally 
reinventing the wheel is always the wrong the thing to do. I didn't 
mean to insinuate what you did was silly or stupid, but that there is 
a right way and a wrong way to do LDAP authentication.

</I>Ok.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't looked at your code, but if you did something silly like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; retrieve the password from the LDAP server and then compare it in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the xdb module, that was very bad thing to do. The password should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; always remain in the LDAP server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How can you judge anything, before even looking at it !
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you're interested in doing LDAP based stuff in jabber, take the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code I wrote for Jabber 1.0 and run with it at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://xdbldap.tigris.org.">http://xdbldap.tigris.org.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was not aware of what you had done, and probably I am not the only
</I>&gt;<i> one. Plus it is good for version 1.0 isn't it ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As you'll find out, we already answered most of the questions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; involved in adding LDAP support to jabber (authentication and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vcard). It just needs to be ported to 1.4.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that you have already answered most of your questions, 
</I>&gt;<i> but the thing is that I couldn't find the answers to mine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Plus there's already a rather good one for 1.4 that I saw last week
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that does authentication, including 0knowledge auth and vcard. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would recommend using that module or extending that module rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than writing your own.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't address my specific needs. I have to use a different
</I>&gt;<i> approach.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While it's always more fun to invent the wheel, it's much more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; useful to the world (and generally more profitable) to hone the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wheel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't do it for fun, unfortunately, I don't have time for that. I
</I>&gt;<i> needed a component to use the jabber server in my specific situation.
</I>&gt;<i> Since I couldn't find it in the available stuff, I built it. Then I
</I>&gt;<i> put it up in the contrib area, in case anyone else needed it. I think
</I>&gt;<i> this is what anyone else, including you would have done. Although we
</I>&gt;<i> wish it was so, nothing in life, is as simple as it looks.
