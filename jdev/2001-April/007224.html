Looks good.  I was thinking though that the JPG is a bit too broad as a 
single document.  Perhaps it might make more sense to split it into three 
JPG's one for creating clients, transports and servers.  Although this will 
result in some overlap between JPG's, since each is really focused on one 
aspect of jabber development, even the overlapping information (such as 
making connections) will probably be discussed in different ways.  And 
different examples could be used to help illustrate important points for 
each audience.

That was my thought looking at the TOC you had.  I think its rare that a 
single person will be doing all three tasks at once... even if that same 
person might eventually tackle all three tasks.

Just my 2cents.
