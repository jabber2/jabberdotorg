<PRE>I thought I'd put my 2 cents in from the JAM perspective.

I am currently developing a commercial software product using Jabber as middleware for chat as well as information sharing. This product relies heavily on the &quot;firewall friendly&quot; single connection point messaging metaphor that Jabber has so elegantly implemented. As in the case of our app, not all uses of Jabber will be purely human to human messaging. 

To require the user to make additional connections or use other software in order to transfer non-chat information, in my opinion, would look like Jabber was only half a solution.  Corporate America has (reluctantly) bought into the messaging metaphor and sees it as safe and non-threatening. If the requirements are raised, many potential users, and software designers, will balk.

I agree with Jens that an in-band, priority based information transfer mechanism must be part of the protocol. Even if it is not implemented in high-performance chat only servers.

  Well, I'm still waiting for evidence that file transfer is going to put excessive load on a Jabber server. But even so, the server could use simple quality-of-service techniques like lowering the priority of file-transfer IQ result elements to preserve the low latency of regular presence and messaging.
