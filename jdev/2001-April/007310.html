Depends on what you mean with &quot;support&quot;. There is no 
type=&quot;invisible&quot;, although a long time ago there was a bug in a TCL 
client (forgot the name of it): it had an option to send presence of 
type=&quot;invisible&quot;, but this of course didn't do anyhting ;)



&gt;<i>  &gt; The only way to do it that I know of, is to send a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;&lt;presence type=unavailable to='X'/&gt;&quot; (for X in each (@roster)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Not necessary; you should _never_ manually send such presence packets

</I>&gt;<i>_server_ your presence, just as you would normally use the default type
</I>&gt;<i>(available) or &quot;dnd&quot; or whatever.
</I>
I disagree! E.g. you might not want to be invisible to everyone, but 
rather show up for a few of your friends. To accomplish this, you 
would first broadcast an invisbile presence, then send a visible 
prence to your choosen buddies.

I am certain on this. Of course I can be wrong, but then, I know the 
protocol pretty well and long (working with Jabber for well over a 
year now, and if you look at the top of the JPG, you'll see my name 
listed &lt;g&gt;).

If this is a design flaw or not is a matter one can be of different 
opinion... after all, it is presence type=&quot;unavailable&quot;, and yes 
indeed, it sort of works like going offline, though you will still 
receive messages. But you will not receive presence updates.

For true invisbility, a type=&quot;invisible&quot; might be interesting. This 
was discussed several times before IIRC. I am not so sure what 
actually where the reasons it was not done. Jer, Temas, anybody, 
comments?



&gt;<i>  &gt; Actually, if I for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  the moment take the role of an IM user, that is good for me! If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  people don't want me to see them, I don't see any reason I should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  allow them to see me! Invisible mode in most IM clients is really a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  spy mode...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think there are valid reasons for wanting to view others' presence without
</I>&gt;<i>currently revealing your own. Several of the people I work with were
</I>&gt;<i>reluctant to use IM at all until I assured them that the client [AIM at the
</I>&gt;<i>time] supported such a mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think the &quot;spying&quot;, to people, feels like it's the other way: some people
</I>&gt;<i>seem to find the idea of broadcasting their presence potentially disturbing,
</I>&gt;<i>and want to know that there's a way to turn it off at least temporarily,
</I>&gt;<i>while still being able to send IMs to their friends.
</I>
You never broadcast your presence to everybody; you broadcast it to 
everybody on your roster... but of course, you might have some ppl on 
your roster you don't want to talk to. Hence, you can send a 
different presence to everbody.



Another neat idea for a Jabber extension: being able to set presence 
roster group based. ;)
