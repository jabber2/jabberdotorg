<PRE>Hi Guys,

David and Jens are correct (I should have posted the resolution). A day or two ago, I discovered that I had a couple of bytes containing 0xB7 in the CDATA. The weird part was that the XML checkers I used (on Windows) didn't complain (go figure, right? :-) which led me in the completely wrong direction. Thanks for your help.

    bytes &gt;127 are actually supposed to be UTF8-encoded


  That's actually almost certainly why the server was barfing on the data -- bad UTF-8, not bad XML. For example, IIRC, a byte &gt;127 indicates the first byte of a multibyte character, and the subsequent byte(s) of the same character are supposed to also have the high bit set. So any three byte sequence of the form [&lt;128] [&gt;=128] [&lt;128] would be illegal UTF-8 and cause the parser to barf.

  So David's recommendation to go with base64 should fix the problem.
