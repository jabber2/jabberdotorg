<PRE>Currently, it can connect to Jabber over base_accept, base_connect, 
or base_exec (for that portion of the connectivity, I'm using
David Waite's JabberBeans, which is delightfully independent of
connection type).

JOSL looks good, I've got some people here looking into
what would best support our interests. (there are others in
consideration)

Anyway, it's still HIGHLY preliminary right now, and I'm 
looking for people to test on a variety of
platforms, give me feedback, and force
me to make this a really solid piece of software.

This sound real cool. 

Are you doing it as a server or command line call?

As for packaging, I think org.jabber.xdb is prefferable since that's 
what it is. And anyone familiar to Jabber server will know that xdb 
is the backend to Jabberd.

Licensing -- Most of the Jabber stuff falls under JOSL but an 
Apache or BSD license would be ok by most people, but GPL 
probably wouldn't (at least it would limit to the places where it 
might get used). However, note that under JOSL, Apache/BSD 
people can take it, &amp; compile it into their code &amp; can add 
proprietary extensions. That may or may not matter to y'all.
