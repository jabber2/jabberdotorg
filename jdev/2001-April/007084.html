Subject: Re: [JDEV] Relationship with .NET?
&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I suggest if we as an industry are going to back anything we back small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; peices of wood made so we can pick our teeth, and LET TOOTHPICKS DIE..&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Shesh..
</I>&gt;<i> Shouldn't that be &quot;sheesh&quot;? Or is that &quot;shush&quot;???
</I>
  HeHe..  Sheesh.  If thats really a word..

&gt;<i> Oh, and I don't use toothpicks... any chance of letting us in on how you
</I>see
&gt;<i> .NET, SOAP and Jabber developing - sorry to be so slow -:)
</I>
    It depends on which side of Jabber your looking at.  If you look at it
as a transport for carrying an XML payload to an enpoint, aka, a messaging
middleware, then Jabber could be used as a means of transporting SOAP calls
'over the wire' between clients and transports.  This would serve as a
replacement for HTTP at that end.

    On the other hand, if you look at Jabber as an Instant Messaging
platform, then SOAP via any of the implemented over the wire protocols
(HTTP, SMTP, etc..) can serve as the messaging layer for Client to server
communications, or even an alternate means of server to server
communications.  This would provide for the ability for any given transport
to be run practically anywhere, under any environment that supports SOAP.
If you look at it, the IQ packets are basically RPC calls MADE over the
Jabber 'over the wire' protocol.  I would almost say if someone created a
client socket manager whos sole job was to serve as a gateway for SOAP
requests, it would allows clients to have MUCH greater flexibility, due to
the fact that they could now take advantage of the many over the wire
protocols SOAP current has, allows things such as firewall traversing, etc,
to happen transparent to the Jabber system itself..

    Remember, though all of this, that when I use the term SOAP, you can
interchange it at any point in time with '.NET'.  '.NET' is simply the
entire idea of making the network servers smarter, so they do the work, and
can extend things in a centralized manner.  Not a new idea.  About to
Microsoft saw this.  C# is simply a language that allows Microsoft to use a
Java like language under its own environment (Ok, their own terms..).  An
example onw can look at it the Perl.NET initiative, by activestate, which is
simply Perl bundled together with some SOAP modules.  This also allows
previously incompatible systems to talk to eachother in a generic way.  An
example of this would be C# and the capability for it to serve up COM
interfaces and SOAP interfaces without any effort at all..

    This is why I made the statement I did.  It was simply stating we should
go with one, and let that same thing die..  8-)..
