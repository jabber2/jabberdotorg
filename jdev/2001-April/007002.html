Far as I can tell, this is a problem with Jabber at the architecture 
level.  A very common source of this kind of disconnect is loss of the 
&quot;flow&quot; through a NAT (ipmasq) box interfacing an office LAN to the public 
net.

Winjab works around this problem.  It sends, once a minute, the five byte 
no-op message
    space space tab space space
to the server.  This keeps the flow open.  In xml terms, this message is 
formally a noop; very cool.

We got into a jam here because a custom client I and my colleagues 
developed didn't send this message.  I fixed this without requiring updates 
of the client in the field by hacking jpolld to send the keepalive message 
from the server to the client.  Works great.

Well, Winjab has the keepalive message, but I don't think the jabber 
session-layer architecture says you HAVE to have it.  (Correct me if I'm 
wrong, Jabber mavens!)

I think the session-layer architecture SHOULD require keepalive. For one 
thing, on a highly scaled-up system the connection ports are a scarce 
resource.  A keepalive message in the architecture would allow a server to 
free up ports for clients that had gone out to lunch in the ways you described.
