<PRE>I think using Jabber to send files is a waste of bandwith and time. 
Look, email attachments were a bad thing. 

Attachments waste bandwith, disk space and you force every user 
who you send the message to, to consume network resources 
*even* if they don't want to.

They were only implemented because we didn't have any other 
mechanism, more importantly nothing like a URL for universal 
naming scheme had been created and hyperlinks weren't widely 
known/popular. 

Don't make the same mistakes with IM. Recognize the fact that for 
every person who has access to an IM client, they also have 
access to a Web browser. Instead of sending actual data around 
the jabber network, send URLs to files on a Web server. If I want to 
read your file, I'll download it.

The hardest part about using URLs is getting the files to a web 
server. But that's fairly easily solved by using the WebDAV 
protocol. If people want to attach a file in the jabber client, have it 
save teh file to a public directory via DAV (IIS has DAV out of the 
box and Apache has mod_dav, with Apache 2 DAV will be out of 
the box as well). The jabber client maintains knowledge of the URL 
and sends that to the end-user(s). They click on the URL, their 
browser starts up and they download the file.

This conserves network resources because the largest component 
(the file to be downloaded) is only sent on request, instead of 
pushed out whether you want to or not.

BTW This idea was mentioned by Jer himself about a year ago.

Come on people, we're pushing a new envelope here.
