I don't think its stupid!  And I'm warning up front that I'm not a 
Jabber.com employee.

My understanding is that the distributed nature of the jabberd being sold 
by jabber.com is one of the reasons jabber.com hopes people will pay for 
something they could otherwise get free... so a competitive advantage so to 
speak.  As such, that particular technology is being held by jabber.com as 
theirs.  It would be up to you to decide (as an &quot;end user&quot;) if its better 
for you to either purchase their solution, or to expend the effort to 
modify the jabber.org jabberd to support multiple machines.  For most 
commercial entities, I would imagine the former (paying for Jabberd.com's 
server) is the best solution.  In addition, they will get paid support with 
all that implies...

If you don't want to buy it, you're going to have to roll your own.  I'm 
not currently aware of any such efforts (although I definitely haven't been 
around long or spent much time investigating this so its best if you check 
also).  From reviewing the current jabberd design, I would think it is 
relatively easy to envision several areas where the server could be split 
up and distributed (its packet messaging and modular architecture makes 
distribution a much simpler task).
