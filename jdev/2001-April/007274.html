Several other people already explained why XML is not a bad choice, 
and I fulyl agree. The only valid point I see in your mail is the 
complaint about the user db done on  a one-file-per-uers basis. 
However, this is just a simple default implementation, done this way 
because it was very cheap to implement.

If you inform yourself a bit, you will find out that the user db is 
actually done in a quite powerful way: there is a generic interface 
called xdb which allows you to basically plugin any user storage. 
There are XDB backends for LDAP, ODBC and MySQL, and you can easily 
write your own. This is much more flexible, as many users (esp. the 
&quot;big&quot; ones) already have existing user DBs, and want to use those. No 
need to sync two DBs this way, just use one for everything!
