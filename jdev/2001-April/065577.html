Far as I can tell, this is a problem with Jabber at the architecture 
level.  A very common source of this kind of disconnect is loss of the 
&quot;flow&quot; through a NAT (ipmasq) box interfacing an office LAN to the public 
net.

Winjab works around this problem.  It sends, once a minute, the five byte 
no-op message
    space space tab space space
to the server.  This keeps the flow open.  In xml terms, this message is 
formally a noop; very cool.

We got into a jam here because a custom client I and my colleagues 
developed didn't send this message.  I fixed this without requiring updates 
of the client in the field by hacking jpolld to send the keepalive message 
from the server to the client.  Works great.

&gt;<i>Some other presence protocols solve this by requiring the client to send a

Well, Winjab has the keepalive message, but I don't think the jabber 
session-layer architecture says you HAVE to have it.  (Correct me if I'm 
wrong, Jabber mavens!)

I think the session-layer architecture SHOULD require keepalive. For one 
thing, on a highly scaled-up system the connection ports are a scarce 
resource.  A keepalive message in the architecture would allow a server to 
free up ports for clients that had gone out to lunch in the ways you described.
