<PRE>&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: Thomas Parslow (PatRat) [mailto:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">patrat at rat-software.com</A>]
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re[2]: [JDEV] Buddy icons &amp; File Transfer
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Instead, I think I'll just build another mini-web server or maybe 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an NSAPI or ISAPI DLL that both senders and recipients will connect 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to simultaneously to send a file.  When the sender decides to send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a file, the client will first connect to this server and do a post 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that tells this web server that it wants to send a file.  This web 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server will respond with a unique URL that the client will use to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give to the recipient.   The client will remain connected to this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> web server, and then send a iq:oob to the recipient, with the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corresponding  URL.  The recipient client will then connect to that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> web server and do a GET on that URI.  Once the recipient is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connected, then he will send an iq:oob result back to the sending 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client.  When the sending client gets this, it will start pushing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the file to the web server.  Once its done, it will close up the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection.   The web server will pipe the data it gets from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> post back to the recipient's connection.  The recipient will GET 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the file and everyone is happy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But that would be incompatible with the current systems...
</I>
How would it be incompatible?  

&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be easier to send the senders ip as part of an url then as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as the other client connects to this and requests the file (an
</I>&gt;<i> http get) the sender stops listening on that port. So while it would
</I>&gt;<i> be possible for a third party to get the file by eavesdropping on the
</I>&gt;<i> conversation and grabbing it before the other client does it would be
</I>&gt;<i> quite unlikely :)
</I>
In P2P file transfers, the sender's IP is part of the URL, for example: 
<A HREF="http://232.132.0.3/foo/file.exe.">http://232.132.0.3/foo/file.exe.</A> But we where talking about file 
transfers when a firewall was in the way.  So I wouldn't need to send
the sender's IP in that case, but the IP of the web server instead.

It certainly would be easy for a 3rd party to snoop on a conversation 
and grab the file in place of the intended recipient.  I believe
that would be a major security hole for our users and some hacker
would take advantage of it eventually.

&gt;<i> That way would remain compatible with the other way being used in
</I>&gt;<i> clients like JabberIM and WinJab, the receiver does not need to know
</I>&gt;<i> whether he/she is downloading directly from the sender or via a third
</I>&gt;<i> party.
</I>
When you say compatible, I'm guessing you are talking about the
recipient having to send the &quot;result&quot; back before the file actually
starts flowing across the pipe?

I don't understand why this wouldn't work in WinJab.  Back a number of 
months ago I was told that this was the right way to do things.  The 
&quot;jabber:iq:oob&quot; section in the JPG, in the &quot;result&quot; method also suggests 
that this is the correct way to send and receive files.  I do know that 
there isn't much documentation on this, so I wouldn't be surprised if 
there are some incompatibilities.  Clearly this needs to be documented 
better.
