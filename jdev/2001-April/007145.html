<PRE>What I really need for webbased chat to be useful is support in the Jabber
Java applet for the new conference subsystem.

&gt;<i> Looking to leverage the Jabber Server for Inline WebBased Chat and
</I>&gt;<i> Notifications.
</I>
I would be very suprised if Jabber server in it's current state was ported to
run on a MS-Windows platform. It would require quite a bit of effort for little
or no gain- it would be more efficient to spend a few hundred bucks on a 2U
chassis x86 pc server and install FreeBSD to run the jabber server :-)

What somebody could do with less effort is compile and execute jabber under
the new Microsoft 'unix execution environment' (Not POSIX, this is new). The
drawback to this is that every host that wants to execute the jabber binary
would need a licensed installation of the execution environment, at a cost of
around $100 per machine. FreeBSD should start looking better and better to you...
