Yup. This obviously isn't an issue for buddy icons, which would be 
~2kbytes.

For file xfers, at the time I suggested breaking the file into 
manageable chunks (32k?) and sending them as separate elements with 
sequence numbers, from which it would be really easy to reconstruct the 
file at the other end. Someone objected that this is an attempt to 
re-implement TCP, but it isn't since we already have a reliable channel 
and out-of-order delivery isn't a problem.
