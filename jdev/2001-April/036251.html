<PRE>Hi All, No body answered to my previous days question about the stability of 
the jabber server 1.4 I am pasting the error log and also the gdb dump. Any 
suggestions on how to avoid the following warning.
xdb_file failed to open file ./spool/tucson/eresmas.xml: No such file or 
directory
After this warning the server core dumps saying segmentation fault.
Any suggestions or thoughts are appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Amar.
