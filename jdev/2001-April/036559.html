<PRE>Well I'm sorry you think our choices are poor, but we believe them to be
rather powerful.

XML is the best way to make the protocol truly extensible, are you
worried about parsing it?  CPU is cheap, so what's the prob?  The only
binary protocol I've seen that is anywhere near as extensible as
Jabber's is AIMs, but once you reach it's level of complexity it's
downright annoying and confusing.  It becomes much simpler to have an
ASCII protocol that is well laid out, XML provides that.  So you ask,
why not just use something else?!  Well, guess what, you can!!!!

Jabber is designed to be front end agnostic to the IM server.  I still
feel XML is the best choice though.

As for your concerns on the storage backend, I suggest you research XDB.
It should squash your fears there.
