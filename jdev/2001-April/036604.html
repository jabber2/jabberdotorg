Naw, being invisible to your ex-girlfriend would be a good way for an angry
ex-boyfriend to know when she is at home. Thank goodness Jabber doesn't
give out the person's IP like ICQ does; I managed to anger lots of random
(apparently pre-teenage) people; they would find my IP and start trying to
hack/crash my machine.  Some people I know stopped using IM clients
completely just because of this reason.

I would not promote an 'invisible' mode which allowed you to stalk people
in these ways. I would proposal a method where you are only online to a
select group of people period; people who were not in your group would not
receive *or* show any presence.
