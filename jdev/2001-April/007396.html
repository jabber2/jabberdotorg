<PRE>Ok lets see if I can summarize what we came up with so far. Figured since I
started this thread I should see if I can bring some conclusion to it, and
maybe even some recommendations. Things that I have since been wondering
about (and did not put in first message) will be included at the end of
this.

It looks like there are 3 options available for transfering files. Each of
these options have pro's and con's. I'll try and list them here. The first
two options (P2P and sepereate server) are the preferred option, the last
option (In-band) should be considered a last option.

For a P2P transfer has the advantage that all the transfers will happen
without the server being involved, this will make sure no extra burden is
placed on the server. The disadvantage of this is when clients are behind a
firewall (restricted ports), or are using NAT (no real address). However in
case of NAT I think if we have the client set up the connection it still
should work. I can see the following protocol:
  Sender -&gt; Receiver [iq file transfer request, IP-address, port, filename,
filesize]
  Receiver -&gt; Sender  [iq no thank you] protocol ends (allows sender to free
up port etc)
or
  Receiver -&gt; Sender &lt;connect to ip:port retrieve file&gt; protocol ends.
This will allow the receiver to keep their IP address hidden (NAT) and will
let the receiver decide whether they want to download the file.

The second option would be to use an additional server. The advantage of
this is that a user can upload the file to the dedicated server once and
have multiple people download the file. Disadvantage is that a specialized
server is required, with usernames and passwords. But there are already this
type of services available, on the other hand people can just place the file
in their personal webpace and send the URL. Advantage is the same as before,
no burden on the server, and both sender and receiver ip address stay
hidden.. I can see the following (very simple) protocol.
  Sender -&gt; Receiver [iq file transfer request, URL]
  Receiver receives file from URL (by potentially passing the URL to a
browser)
This is the easiest protocol to implement, but the sender has to trust the
inbetween agent.

The final option is for users to use the server as an intermediary. The
advantage of this is that we can use the existing infrastructure and if
people can connect to the server they can transfer the files. Disadvantage
(and this can be major, this why this should be a last possibility) that the
server will be in the middle of the file transfer and will have to handle
all messages. I can see the following protocol
  Sender -&gt; Receiver [iq file transfer request, &lt;cookie&gt;, filename,
filesize]
  Receiver -&gt; Sender [iq request file chunk, &lt;cookie&gt; | filename, chucksize,
&lt;last ID received&gt;] (
  Sender -&gt; Receiver [iq file chuck, &lt;cookie&gt; | filename, chucksize, ID]
(repeat untill file is received)
This allows the receiver to control how fast it receives the data. If the
receiver requests more data than the sender is willing to send in one chunk
it can send a smaller chunk.

Best would be if we have some sort of global process. So maybe a total
protocol would be something like
S --&gt; R : &lt;iq file-transfer-request, cookie, filename, size&gt;
R --&gt; S : &lt;iq file-transfer-request, cookie, &quot;No Thanks&quot;&gt; END
R --&gt; S : &lt;iq file-transfer-request, cookie, &quot;Yes Please&quot;, list of transport
mechanism in order[P2P, URL, IB]&gt;
and then depending on what the server wants and what the client can do, jump
to the right protocol as listed above.

Interesting becomes when we start to add gateways to other IM's to the whole
problem. Now the gateway will pretend to be the sender. In the case of the
transfer protocol with the other IM is not a P2P connection, or requires
some additional data to be send before the connection is established the
gateway will need to become a sender and receiver (receiving the file from
the other IM and sending it to the jabber user). YUCK

Anyhow, hope I did not miss anything and this helps a  little,

Rob
