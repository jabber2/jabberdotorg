<PRE>&gt;<i> Ah, but have you tried downloading and registering an new ICQ account?
</I>Sure
&gt;<i> when you have set it up it's OK, but as soon as you have registered a new
</I>&gt;<i> account within a few seconds you get spam'd!
</I>
Not wanting to turn this list into a spam discussion, but I have a very low
iCQ number, and you'd have thought i'd get more spam, being at the
beginnings of their list (esp. seeing as iCQ numbers only start at 100,000).
They can't spam you if you have those options ticked, as iCQ simply ignores
it. They're not on your list, you don't get anything. They send it thru the
web or email, again, you don't get it. Not sure what the implementation is
in iCQ-t, but i'm sure such ignore measures could be put in, but obviously
in most cases wouldn't be desired, as many haven't imported their entire iCQ
lists.
