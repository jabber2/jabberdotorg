Okay, &quot;fast enough&quot; isn't really accurate, you need to cheat to be faster
than someone's own server.

Suppose I want to target someone and I know the server they use, the account
there, the fixed resource they have set and that I have control over the
network my target is using.

I can see there's an outgoing connection to an XMPP server, but it's using TLS
so I can't directly manipulate it. However, the initial packets on a stream
usually have a set ordering, depending on the client. If I know the roster
retrieval is always the 3rd iq packet, and always the 7th TLS packet, then I
can delay the 7th TLS packet while I send an new packet to the target's
server:

    &lt;iq type='result' id='2' to='<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">target at domain.lit</A>/Resource'&gt;
        (evil spoofed roster contents here)
    &lt;/iq&gt;

If the client doesn't check 'from' adresses properly, it won't notice this
reply didn't come from their own server, but from me.


A less complicated attack:

Suppose I'm in a MUC, I see you join and your client starts requesting vcards
for everyone in the MUC sequentially. I get request with id x, but I reply
with a spoofed image for requests x+1, x+2, x+3, etc. It's not guaranteed to
work as I need to be faster than the other clients, but as long as it can
occasionally work it's a vulnerability.
