<PRE>Carolina,

&gt;<i> I was searching for XMPP C++ libraries, but I was unable to find
</I>&gt;<i> anything useful.
</I>
You'll have to expand on your definition of 'useful.'

&gt;<i> Jaberoo is no more maintained, oajabber is in early stages is
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to compile (also requiere xerces). There are others
</I>&gt;<i> libraries like loudmouth but requires gnome libraries or iris that
</I>&gt;<i> need qt libraries. I must say iksemel? (but is in c).
</I>
Is it an issue of dependencies?  Why can't you use these libs?

On a side note, last I looked, Loudmouth is C (not C++) and it depends on glib 
(not GNOME).  Also, there is the recently announced &quot;libstrophe&quot; (in C), 
which by the sound of it probably doesn't have much in the way of 
dependencies.

&gt;<i> I think that this lack of good libraries, is comploting agains the
</I>&gt;<i> succes of Xmpp protocol. Each application must develop it's own
</I>&gt;<i> libraries like psi, gaim, exodus, miranda, etc. A good idea maybe to
</I>&gt;<i> centralize the development of one library that everyone can use (like
</I>&gt;<i> openssl, libz, libpng).
</I>
Well, of those clients you mention, the only C++ client is Psi, and both it 
and KDE's Kopete are powered by the Iris library.  So at least there you see 
some code re-use.  But you're right, jabber-lib sharing among end-user 
clients is depressingly uncommon.

As for Gaim and Miranda, they were developed before there were any C libs.  
Maybe they could switch to using iksemel, loudmouth, or libstrophe.

-Justin
