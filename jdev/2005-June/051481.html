<PRE>Hi Peter !!!!!

    I was selected for the SOC on jabber and I must say that I am
honored with it !!! It seems that there were so many good proposals
for jabber and, according to your blog, a lot of discussion, and I'm
happy to have mine considered !!! I will do my best to make this
decision worthy !!! I was selected to write a lingo director library
for the Jabber Protocol !!! It will be a lot of fun !

   Unfortunatly, my best project (in my opnion, not that a lingo
library isn't nice =) ) wasn't select (social network component to
jabber), perhaps because it was too big for a summer job ... I'll try
to write it anyway, because it was something that I tought for a while
... Anyway, I am happy to be in your blog comments !!!!!!!!

   hope to keep in contact, 

  Cya, mel

    

In the latest installment of his critique of social networking
applications, Stowe Boyd argues again for their integration into ways
that people really work and communicate over the Internet, especially
instant messaging and weblogs. He further observes:

    MSN and AOL have fiddled around with integration of the most
obvious social tools -- instant messaging and blogs -- but I am
waiting expectantly to see something huge come out of Google and Yahoo
in this area. Google is going to launch its own Firefox-based browser,
and integrating instant messaging (from Picasa?), blogging, and
son-of-Orkut friend of a friend stuff should follow. Ditto with
Yahoo's integration of Flickr (which was an instant messaging tool
before it was a social networking photo world), including it's
blogging capablities, into the Yahoo Messenger and Groups world.

Well, that's all fine and I expect it to happen, but there are plenty
of folks who don't necessarily want to get into bed with MSN, AOL,
Yahoo, or Google. For them, decentralized solutions are needed -- and
for that, we need integration of decentralized IM, blogging, and
social networking technologies. My conclusion: we need a conversation
between Jabber folks and WordPress folks (among others) to explore
this space and build tools that are under the individual's control. I
was chatting about this stuff the other day with one of the Google
Summer of Code applicants and I think there are exciting possibilities
here. Stay tuned...

( this is me in your blog !! hehe ... unless there is someone else
with the same idea ... )
