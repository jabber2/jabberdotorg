</I>
Lots of clients support this feature using a protocol that I will
document Real Soon Now [tm].

&gt;<i> * Pubsub support
</I>
We have the service implementations (Idavoll component, ejabberd server)
but (IMHO) no compelling applications or client-side support yet.

&gt;<i> * VoIP support (but this one is rather a Ph.D. project)
</I>
Um, yeah, I think that is a Ph.D. project. :-) But I know of one Summer 
of Code proposal about integrating some Jabber features into Asterisk
(more about notifications etc. than the VoIP side of things, but you
never know where a project like that might lead).

&gt;<i> * Virtual presence
</I>
Heiner loves VP, but I haven't seen a lot of demand for it myself yet.
;-)

In general, the main focus of the Summer of Code is to get students
interested in and familiar with open-source software development. IMHO
the best way for that to happen is to work on a project that really
excites you. Naturally it would be nice if such a project also added a
feature that lots of people want, but that is not the primary goal, I
think. If the top #1 issue was avatar support but the only proposal we
received was to write a C++ library for Jabber/XMPP development, we'd
approve the proposal and not tell that person to work on GUIs. :-)
