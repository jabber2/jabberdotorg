Well, I think if Psi in particular wanted someone for Summer of Code,  
you should have looked into becoming a sponsor yourself. Psi is  
certainly a popular Jabber client, but that's no guarantee that the  
JSF would pick proposals specifically for Psi.

If it's your brother and he's already interested in helping out with  
open source stuff anyway, perhaps you could still convince him to do  
it...
