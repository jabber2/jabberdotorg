Xhtml-im is part-written, I was planning on helping with the plugins  
code as I have a particular interest in that, and the UI overhauls  
weren't to be major. Additionally it was my brother who happens to  
live in the same city as me, so co-operation wasn't going to be an  
issue. 3 months is a long time to code if you're doing nothing else.

Anyway, it didn't happen and I'm very sad on behalf of Psi, but hey,  
our release schedule will just trundle along at it's usual slow pace;  
the features are all planned anyway, it's just likely to be 2006  
sometime. I think I'd put too much hope in getting the help over the  
summer :/
