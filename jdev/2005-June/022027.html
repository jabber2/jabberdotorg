<PRE>Hi,

I'm a french student from Toulouse on IT who have 19 years old, and who
want to participate to the Google summer of code.
I have seen that Jabber is on summer of code organisation. So I think
it's an organization which can be an mentoring organization.

I 'am interested to participate to this summer of code.
I have an idea of project for the summer. I don't think if a lot of
people is agree with. 

I think jabber is very good, but for the moment I think it only have
one problem : jabber is only on software for end users. A lot of people
doesn't want to install any new software because a lot of virus travel
over packages.
So my idea is to create from scratch( to get the summer more hard ) a
java applet destined to end users, with no really advanced functions,
only vCards, chatting, getting with transports, MUC support, and roster
utilities.

I think it's a good idea because no one applet does exist really for
end users. Only greenthumb can be for end users and I think it have a
lot a problem, only about graphical organization. But it's good :)

Well, I think someone like Peter Saint-Andre can answer to my proposal.
Perhaps it does not interest really. But I think it can do the jabber
comunity more large.

I hope my project will be accepted by Google and Jabber Foundation.
