&gt;<i> * Presence notification as you said.  For example next to the name of

</I>&gt;<i> I've seen this done using a bot to maintain the presence subscriptions
</I>&gt;<i> (see Edgar <A HREF="http://edgar.netflint.net">http://edgar.netflint.net</A>).
</I>Any features edgar could use? This one seems pretty straight forward to me.

&gt;<i> * Authentication is a good one.  Drupal used to have a module that
</I>&gt;<i> would allow you during the account login process to use your Jabber ID
</I>&gt;<i> as your username.  And when you enter your password, it would pass it
</I>&gt;<i> to your jabber server to auth you.  Very novel, for a GPL CMS.  And if
</I>&gt;<i> your account didn't exist during login, it's created on-the-fly,
</I>&gt;<i> because of course a user ID will have to exist in Drupal's database
</I>&gt;<i> for permissions and stuff.  Note the phrase &quot;used to&quot; above.  It's no
</I>&gt;<i> longer maintained, and if I recall correctly, it would require
</I>&gt;<i> updating to be compatible with the current version.  I for one could
</I>&gt;<i> really use this Drupal mod.
</I>I like this idea, but also like openid authentication. I'd really like
a discussion comparing the advantages of both before I pick one. It
would certainly be interesting to integrate openid into a jabber
server.

&gt;<i> * Send jabber messages (as type=headline) to subscribers to a
</I>&gt;<i> forum/wiki/cms when certain criteria is met, such as: new article,
</I>&gt;<i> article you are monitoring is changed, opt-in announcements list has a
</I>&gt;<i> new item.  Some systems do this already (e.g. Unclassified Newsboard
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://newsboard.unclassified.de">http://newsboard.unclassified.de</A>), but MW and Drupal are extremely
</I>&gt;<i> popular and lack this native functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> * You could be the first to implement a pubsub service that would mate
</I>&gt;<i> with a CMS.  Maybe every article is exposed as a node, and users can
</I>&gt;<i> maintain subscriptions that way?
</I>&gt;<i> * Same for remote control (<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0146.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0146.html</A>),
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps for administration purposes?
</I>&gt;<i> * Perhaps an XMPP messaging API for a CMS?  It could be used by other
</I>&gt;<i> plugin authors for integrating IM into their sites.
</I>&gt;<i> * XML-RPC-style pings over Jabber that create automated links between
</I>&gt;<i> Wiki pages.  <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">WikiArticleA at server1.com</A> has &quot;See Also:
</I>&gt;<i> [interwiki-link-to-server2:WikiArticleB]&quot;, and the act of saving the
</I>&gt;<i> article will ping server2.com and create a trackback-style entry in
</I>&gt;<i> the destination article.  Wow, that's a good idea.  Put my name in the
</I>&gt;<i> credits please.  :)
</I>Wow. There are a ton of related ideas here. Seems cool, but would it
be worthy of a jabber sponsorship? Mediawiki isn't a sponsor, but it
would benefit from these ideas more than drupal, in my uniformed
opinion.
