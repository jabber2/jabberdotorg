<PRE>Quoting Richard Dobson &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">richard at dobson-i.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The thing is they work in fundamentally different ways and simply 
</I>&gt;<i> adding use cases will not allow JEP-0070 work in the way JEP-0101 
</I>&gt;<i> does, JEP-0070 requires that the web server be tied to a jabber 
</I>&gt;<i> server for it to work which creates some serious scalability and 
</I>&gt;<i> security concerns which are especially problematic for web farms, 
</I>&gt;<i> whereas JEP-0101 allows the jabber (ticket serving) component to be 
</I>&gt;<i> completely separated from the webserver. JEP-0101 also potensially 
</I>&gt;<i> means less network roundtrips in the jabber layer as the client can 
</I>&gt;<i> use the same ticket across multiple websites and pages without having 
</I>&gt;<i> to re-request it, overall JEP-0101 is a much more scalable and 
</I>&gt;<i> efficient solution.
</I>
You're right, but regardless of scaleability and efficiency, it's still
defining more or less the same thing which was already defined in JEP-0070.
The title of JEP-0070 pretty much reads as exactly what JEP-0101 does.
It could have been co-authored or something to merge the two ideas so
that it would work either way. :-)

Actually, I'm not entirely convinced that JEP-0070 requires a Jabber
server to be embedded in the web server.  The same protocol would work
with only a client embedded in the server, just like existing web sites
don't require an embedded email server to send email confirmations.
It's a little inefficient, yes.  It's not so conceptually perfect, because
it did require the user confirming the message, rather than having anything
automated... but I do think the two could have been merged somehow.
