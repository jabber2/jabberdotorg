<PRE>&gt;<i> By jabber notifications support in MediaWiki, are we talking presence
</I>&gt;<i> notification? What else could be worth noting?
</I>&gt;<i> And by jabber authentication like Drupal in MediaWiki, do you mean
</I>&gt;<i> also like OpenID? I wonder what the advantages, most importantly the
</I>&gt;<i> integrity of both identity systems happens to be. Or is something else
</I>&gt;<i> intended?
</I>
I can list a few ideas that apply to either system, or many other
wikis and CMSs.

* Send jabber messages (as type=headline) to subscribers to a
forum/wiki/cms when certain criteria is met, such as: new article,
article you are monitoring is changed, opt-in announcements list has a
new item.  Some systems do this already (e.g. Unclassified Newsboard
<A HREF="http://newsboard.unclassified.de">http://newsboard.unclassified.de</A>), but MW and Drupal are extremely
popular and lack this native functionality.
* Presence notification as you said.  For example next to the name of
the author of a page is a graphical indicator of their jabber status. 
I've seen this done using a bot to maintain the presence subscriptions
(see Edgar <A HREF="http://edgar.netflint.net">http://edgar.netflint.net</A>).
* Authentication is a good one.  Drupal used to have a module that
would allow you during the account login process to use your Jabber ID
as your username.  And when you enter your password, it would pass it
to your jabber server to auth you.  Very novel, for a GPL CMS.  And if
your account didn't exist during login, it's created on-the-fly,
because of course a user ID will have to exist in Drupal's database
for permissions and stuff.  Note the phrase &quot;used to&quot; above.  It's no
longer maintained, and if I recall correctly, it would require
updating to be compatible with the current version.  I for one could
really use this Drupal mod.

Let' see what else... 

* You could be the first to implement a pubsub service that would mate
with a CMS.  Maybe every article is exposed as a node, and users can
maintain subscriptions that way?
* Same for remote control (<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0146.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0146.html</A>),
perhaps for administration purposes?
* I can think of a dozen other ways a new jabber server component
could integrate with a CMS...
* Perhaps an XMPP messaging API for a CMS?  It could be used by other
plugin authors for integrating IM into their sites.
* XML-RPC-style pings over Jabber that create automated links between
Wiki pages.  <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">WikiArticleA at server1.com</A> has &quot;See Also:
[interwiki-link-to-server2:WikiArticleB]&quot;, and the act of saving the
article will ping server2.com and create a trackback-style entry in
the destination article.  Wow, that's a good idea.  Put my name in the
credits please.  :)
