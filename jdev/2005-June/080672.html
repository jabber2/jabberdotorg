<PRE>Does anybody know about implementations of workflow using jabber protocol?

</I>&gt;<i> Sure using the word &quot;server&quot; was probably the wrong term to use, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it does require some kind of jabber &quot;component&quot; or other to be tied 
</I>&gt;<i> into the webserver for it to work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's a little inefficient, yes.  It's not so conceptually perfect, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it did require the user confirming the message, rather than having 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automated... but I do think the two could have been merged somehow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe so but im not sure how as the author of the other spec seemed to 
</I>&gt;<i> want to go about it in an entirely different way which was not really 
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with how I needed it to work (I use a version of this spec 
</I>&gt;<i> in production and had been before either protocol came out), all I was 
</I>&gt;<i> doing was documenting a method I use that works very well. After 
</I>&gt;<i> JEP-0070 came out I considered implementing that instead but it 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldnt have worked very well in my situation for the reasons already 
</I>&gt;<i> outlined and since they do go about it in two fundamentally different 
</I>&gt;<i> ways I didnt see the problem at the time with releasing my spec too, I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought it might come in useful for someone.
