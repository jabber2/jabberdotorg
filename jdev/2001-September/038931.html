<PRE>FWIW, we had a lot of discussion about next-gen XDB at Jabber Inc. a few
months back. The current XDB is not designed to support more granular data
operations such as updating a specific field in your vCard (right now, you
get the whole vCard and then overwrite the whole thing). But to make these
changes, we'd need a major XDB protocol overhaul. That's one reason we
pulled back from the brink of creating a next-gen XDB component (the
variety of &quot;bindings&quot; such as LDAP, SQL, and so on is another -- you need
a layered approach to building this kind of component in any kind of
generalized fashion).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Duh, I wasn't thinking here.  I still need a mechanism to pass to xdb a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; e-mail address to search on.  Sooo, I pose the same question about adding an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; xdb search to the already coded xdb set, and xdb get.  Am I the only one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that thinks this would be a good idea?  Input from anyone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought about doing something like this. The problem is that the XDB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is designed as a layer that hides the details of the backend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation. So what would the search string look like? For LDAP, its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a filter. For an SQL backend, it might be a certain SELECT query. There's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no easy way to do it without knowing something about the backend.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What would be really good, though a significant development effort,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be an implementation of something like XML Query (see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query">http://www.w3.org/XML/Query</A>). I haven't looked into this in any depth,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but it is quite interesting. I will do some reading.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am also aware of some new Data Management components (aka XDB++) in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the works, though I'm not aware of their capabilities. Perhaps one of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the developers on this project would like to give an overview of whats
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different?
