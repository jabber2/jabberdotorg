<PRE>I am also  getting conference messages truncated, often at the first byte
of a one-liner. Using JabberIM I will type something like:

	I see this problem too, looks like it is a bug in the server?

And what the participants see and what I get echoed back is just:

	I

Has anybody seen this exact behavior? Any suggestions for a fix?


This is running Jabber-1.4.1 on a Solaris 8 server. I had been running on
a FreeBSD system and _never_ saw this bug, then I copied the source code
over to Solaris, recompiled, and now I have this annoying problem!

After migration I went from having 1-3 users in a conference to 8-20 users,
so at first I thought it was related to the increased number of participants,
but it could just be a Solaris issue.

&gt;<i> I noticed very similar behavior when sending a message to an offline contact
</I>&gt;<i> using the 1.4.1 code on a Solaris 7 machine.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the same exact code
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.4/final/jabber-1.4.1.tar.gz">http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.4/final/jabber-1.4.1.tar.gz</A>), compiled
</I>&gt;<i> on a linux box (redhat 6.2), does NOT show this behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was forced to conclude that either something went awry during the
</I>&gt;<i> compilation process under solaris, or one of the open-source libraries I
</I>&gt;<i> installed (from www.sunfreeware.com) was responsible for this bug.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, even more likely, one of the utilities from sun is responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> this behavior.  Either way, I could not duplicate the problem under Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know this info might not help you get it running under solaris, but at
</I>&gt;<i> least you wont have to be overly confused if other people tell you they
</I>&gt;<i> can't duplicate the problem.

</I>&gt;<i> Many moons ago I mentioned that the conference module often cuts off 
</I>&gt;<i> chat messages if they contain XML metacharacters like quotes, angle 
</I>&gt;<i> brackets, etc. In fact I've had to make my client translate those 
</I>&gt;<i> characters into less offensive ones (like curly quotes) on the way out 
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid hitting this bug.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I found a related problem: Multi-line conference messages often 
</I>&gt;<i> appear to get cut off after the first line. (That is, a newline is 
</I>&gt;<i> causing message truncation just like the XML metacharacters do.) What's 
</I>&gt;<i> weird is that the sender will (about half the time) be echoed the full 
</I>&gt;<i> message, but other people in the chat never receive the full message. 
</I>&gt;<i> I've looked at the raw XML on both sides to verify this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is with the 1.4.1 server on Solaris.
