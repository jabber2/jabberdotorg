hm... my first reaction is &quot;jabber can do it, i'm sure, and do it better 
than anything else, so to hell with porting to other platforms&quot;. then i 
caught myself and realized that you do have a point with 
interoperability. so i'm going to propose a comprimise between my old 
and your ways: we treat auth in jabber like we treat IM. that is, jabber 
has it's own protocol that works best for it, but then also has 
'transports' to other auth systems (like liberty alliance's, passport 
federation, and dotgnu's when/if they get it done). this way jabber 
keeps the power of having it's own custom system, but interoperates with 
ease to others... i think this is the best approach.
