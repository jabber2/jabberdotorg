Yes, it may be a small amount of data but that doesn't excuse us from
fully considering it's impact.  What happens when you have millions of
users and each one has multiple resource.  It's hard to tell but I have
some proposals, although these aren't implemented currently, we are
looking at new Data Management components (XDB++).  What if per resource
data stored int he DM was only persistent through the life of that
resource, but data stored for the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at server</A> scheme would be always
there.  To further enhance this we could make it so that if a
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at server</A>/resource lookup fails, then it could fall back on the
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at server</A> data if it is available.  Again, this would be future, but
who know, I might convince jer to do it for 1.4.2.  Thoughts?
