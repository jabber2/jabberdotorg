<PRE>First off, I don't believe in the idea of having similar-looking Jabber 
clients. It would be nice to have a defacto client for each OS which 
looks and acts similarly, but beyond that, I want creativity to shine. I 
want to see different approaches at IM, not 20 VB clients for windows 
which look and act *exactly the same* - what's the point in that?

Replies within.

Actually, latest jabberd does support invisible.


&gt;<i> * You don't mention one issue that bugs me about current Jabber clients. 
</I>&gt;<i> The Jabber &quot;resource name&quot; is associated with a particular login. The 
</I>&gt;<i> best usage of this is to identify the location of the client, i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;work&quot; or &quot;laptop&quot; or &quot;home&quot;. For a non-PC client the type might be 
</I>&gt;<i> useful, like &quot;cellphone&quot; or &quot;T900 pager&quot;. However, whenever I look at my 
</I>&gt;<i> buddy list it seems like most of the clients (gabber, winjab, etc.) just 
</I>&gt;<i> use the name of the client as the resource name. This is fairly useless 
</I>&gt;<i> -- usually I don't care what brand of desktop client they use. It /is/ 
</I>&gt;<i> often useful to know whether they're at home, at work, in a cafe, 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever. IMHO the client, when first run, should ask the user to enter 
</I>&gt;<i> a resource name, and it should store that as a persistent preference. 
</I>&gt;<i> This type-in field should not default to the brand name of the client; 
</I>&gt;<i> it should be blank to encourage the user to type something meaningful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

According to all statistics I can get ahold of and from various small user tests - people do *not* easily understand the concept of a resource unless they specifically intend to be logged in multiple times - and *most* users never use that feature of Jabber. Therefore, 'Gabber' is the default resource to reduce confusion - if the user doesn't understand it, they don't have to become frustrated trying to figure out what is going on. They can live happily without know what a resource is. That's the entire point of the MacOS HI guideline which states that options are nice, but you *must* *have* *good* *defaults*.


If in the future the majority of users need to understand the concept of 
a resource, I'll gladly remove the default, but the point of UI is to 
reduce the amount of information a user must learn and retain.

I need sleep
