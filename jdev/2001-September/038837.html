<PRE>&gt;<i>  I, of course, agree with temas here. I have quite a few
</I>&gt;<i> comments  already, but I'll look at your guide a bit
</I>&gt;<i> more thoroughly tomorrow and make a reply.
</I>
Thanks, that would be great.

&gt;<i> One major thing that struck me was that you said
</I>&gt;<i> server hard disk space won't be wasted by history.
</I>
Did I?  Depends on what you mean by &quot;wasted&quot; I guess.  Data is going to take
some space obviously.

I will go back and review that section actually.  I cut and pasted it from
an old note and maybe it could be better worded.  It's not really a UI
issue, I just wanted somewhere to put my rant.

My main point, is that the history should not be saved locally.

&gt;<i> My logs from the past two years total 50 megs.
</I>
Really?  My ICQ history database for the last 4 years is only 20MB (more
once it's indexed).
Have you tried zipping it?

&gt;<i> 50 megs... 100 000 users on a server. Even 10 000 users on
</I>&gt;<i> a server. Would you care to pay for that much disk space?
</I>
Nope, but I'd be happy to pay for 50MB for my own account.

I think you miss my point(s) somewhat...

- It doesn't actually have to be on the same physical machine, just
somewhere that all clients can access it.
- It doesn't have to be enabled on every server, or it can be an optional
(chargeable) feature.
- Admins can fix a limit to archive sizes - most people won't want to refer
to a chat session 4 years old.
- Not all people will want to save message history.
- Disk space gets cheaper every year.
- The advantages outweigh the storage issues.

&gt;<i> And remember, these messages are all plain text.
</I>&gt;<i> Just wait until we have rich text formatted messages.
</I>
Good point...I was thinking that ICQ was rich text, but looking at it now,
it just seems to save the font and colours.  I guess there are a few
options - wear the extra resources, or convert to plain text maybe.  I
wouldn't get hung up on the space issue...  A good design is more important
at this stage.

Michael.
