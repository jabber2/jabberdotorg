<PRE>Can someone please help!

I sent a request to the admin group for a working sample of a jabber.xml server file and got no response. We are trying to setup a jabber server for conferencing and can't get it to work. Does anyone have a copy of a working jabber.xml config file such as the one used on the jabber.org server?

Thanks,
Stuart

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'll take a stab; how about:

Entity - Any thing which interacts with the Jabber system, and/or which
is available to be interacted with by other Entities in the Jabber system.
Jabber IM User - An entity using the Jabber system as an
Instant-messaging platform.
Component - An entity which has a trusted relationship with a Jabber
server, and which provides some set of services to Entities (either to
Jabber IM Users or to other Components)

Gateway - A component which provides direct access to non-Jabber
services to Jabber IM Users. No distinction is made to whether the
component also allows a mapping from the non-Jabber service to access
all of Jabber
Agent - A component which provides a mapping between a non-Jabber
services and the Jabber system by authenticating with that remote system
on behalf of a Jabber User.
Transport - An agent which specifically provides access to a non-Jabber
Instant Messaging system.

Examples:

    * Jabber conferencing would be a component, because it is providing
      a native Jabber service
    * IRC access would be considered a gateway since IRC is a remote
      service, but there is no registration required
    * Access to an IMAP mailbox (some sort of jabber-biff) would be
      considered an agent, since registration is required
    * Access to AIM or Yahoo! would be considered a transport

How is that? :-)
