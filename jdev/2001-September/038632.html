Depends on the protocol - with the &quot;groupchat&quot; protocol, all IQs may or 
may not get rewritten and delivered to the user's resource; as you said, 
it was never defined. With the &quot;conference&quot; module in jabber.org CVS, 
there is a 'privacy' tag you specify when you join to indicate whether 
or not IQs should be routed. With &quot;jcf&quot;, all IQ traffic is defined to go 
to the user's representation within the room, i.e. no IQs will be 
delivered to a user.

What we really have here is a need for subscribing to more than just a 
user's sessions, but to also to indicate interest and get published 
updates for other user data and session data. Presence just isn't 
fine-grained enough for that. If we had something fine-grained, you 
could just as well serialize the data within the push, rather than 
trying to use a hash to save bandwidth.

On a different note,  what is the benefit of being able to define an 
avatar for different resources? It seems like what a user wants is to 
see the same picture for the same person everytime.
