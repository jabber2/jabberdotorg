i'm using mozilla on linux, mail is getting through fine... mozilla 9.4, 
although it's crashing on me alot...

first, let's look into proper terminology first. i've been watching a 
few other mailing lists and newsletters, and there seems to be a common 
misconception between 'authentication' and 'authorization'... alot of 
open source people are saying MS is improperly using the term 
'authentication' or improperly labelling their system, or something like 
that... i'm going to investigate this more...

last, should we do this as out own JIG, or as poart of the security-jig?

i'm thinking maybe as the security-jig, but would change my mind if it 
could be shown this is outside their scope, or we would not be efficient 
as a broader JIG.

great work, mike!
