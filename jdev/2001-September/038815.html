</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As part of an R&amp;D project, we have created a telephony transport that 
</I>&gt;<i> lets users manage phone calls. They can make outgoing calls, accept 
</I>&gt;<i> in bound calls, create audio conferences, redirect calls to voice 
</I>&gt;<i> mail, screen calls, pick them up and so on. So for so good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The telephony transport interfaces with a server system that provides 
</I>&gt;<i> all of the telephony support as well as maintains information for 
</I>&gt;<i> each user including an address book. The back end system is also 
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining presence and availability for its user community.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> would be real nice to integrate the address book and presence 
</I>&gt;<i> information from the back end system via the transport with the 
</I>&gt;<i> roster and presence information that the user has available with 
</I>&gt;<i> their Jabber client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally both the Jabber server and the Transport server would be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to access common address book and PAM servers/services and this 
</I>&gt;<i> problem would go away. But they don't as yet.  The telephony system 
</I>&gt;<i> makes the Transport aware of the user's address book entries and 
</I>&gt;<i> presence info. The Transport in turn would like to hand that to the 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber Server on behalf of the registered user and have it magically 
</I>&gt;<i> appear in the Jabber client for that user.  Roster updates on behalf 
</I>&gt;<i> of a user by the transport are blocked apparently for security 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons.  Makes sense.  Presence information gets through and is 
</I>&gt;<i> reflected by the client.  Is there a legitimate way for a Transport 
</I>&gt;<i> to modify/update/alter a user roster?  Is there some other mechanism 
</I>&gt;<i> that would make it possible for the Transport to set up and maintain 
</I>&gt;<i> rosters that could then be accessed by specific user clients?  Will 
</I>&gt;<i> this require a Jabber Server module to work in conjunction with the 
</I>&gt;<i> Transport?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any and all pointers and help would be appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks

Hey, this sounds like a really neat project.  Sounds like you are going
to want a specific XDB module.  It could be that it only handles a few
of the namespaces and let another one handle the regular user info.  I
wish I had a doc to point to about this, but I don't =(  If you have
more questions about XDB modules and how they work feel free to email me
or msg me.  <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">temas at jabber.org</A> for both.
