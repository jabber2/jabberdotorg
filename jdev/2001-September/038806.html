<PRE>I just found out the O'Reilly P2P Conference has been rescheduled to Nov
4-8, which is really bad for me since that puts it in a *perfect* time
for me to attend. I've been planning to head up the east coast in mid
November to visit my best friend. Along the way, on Nov 9th, I'm
stopping off in Baltimore to attend the 'Open Source in Banking and
Finance' conference, which Harold Gottschalk (aka 'Heg') has been
gracious enough to sponsor me to, under IMissary, Inc
[<A HREF="http://www.imissary.com].">http://www.imissary.com].</A>

So I was elated to find that the P2P conference worked in perfectly with
my time schedule... But then saw the price, and realized there was no
way in hell I was going to afford that. I almost dropped the idea before
a little voice pipped up with a suggestion that I just can't get rid of,
no matter how absurd it is...

Anyone willing to help me out?  :-)  :-)  :-)

Yeah, completely absurd question...

I have no idea what I can offer in return, except taking really good
notes of it, maybe taking along a cassette recorder, and pumping Jabber
to the crowds...

I doubt Jabber, Inc would be willing to dish out any kind of money to
pay a non-employee to go, so I'm going to plead to the community as a
whole... Any chance, or am I just 'on something'?  :-)

Well, I guess I'll just keep my fingers crossed, and hope...

&lt;voice type=&quot;whine&quot;&gt;Aww... c'mon, people, you know I love ya, right??
help a fellow jabberite out... i'll love ya even more...!&lt;/voice&gt;   :-)

</PRE>
