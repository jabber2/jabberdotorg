<PRE>Oh, yes, I agree. We still are lacking a very good windows client. We 
definitely need some UI designers (who are aware of the Windows UI 
guidelines, by the way, and try to make the app follow them) to work 
with some programmers to get a really good windows client out there. But 
that's completely different from having an official Jabber specification 
stating that all clients must be ICQ. Even an informal one, I don't 
agree with. All it takes is one really good Jabber client, then the rest 
are free to do what they want, we can all point toward the one we like.
