<PRE>Hiya,

Firstly, I'd like to make clear that I am well aware of the difference 
between authentication and authorization. The JIG says this:




The rise of the Microsoft Passport system has demonstrated that users 
want and need authentication services on the net. In brief, distributed 
authentication allows you to login to the network once, and from that 
point on be recognised by all sites that conform to the standard. This 
is known as Single Sign-In. Passport however suffers fundamental 
limitations - this document is not really the place to discuss them - 
and Jabber can do better.

Authorization is something different, as commented on below. The JIG 
would deal first with authentication, then moving on the authorization, 
to allow services to access aspects of the users account. Again, we 
would attempt to do this in a server transparent fashion, so that the 
users host doesn't necessarily have to be running a Jabber server - just 
any server that conforms to the protocol will do.




I thought about calling it the auth jig, but I'm not sure how good a 
name that is. I decided upon authentication as this would be the primary 
focus, moving on to authorization later. I'm fine with changing it 
though, if people want me to.
thanks -mike
