agree 100%

But, even if a user doesn't intent to log on multiple times simultaneously, a description of where they are currently logged in from is still useful.  Surely it is clear to a user that they are entering a description of what computer they are logging in from and when they look at another user in their roster they can see where they are logged in from?... even if they don't understand the concept of resources and how they interact.

If I gave a Jabber client to an inexperienced Jabber user and it said enter a description of where you are connecting from, they would enter &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Laptop&quot; or something and then they would never have to worry about it again.
