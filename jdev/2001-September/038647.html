Just thought of another, more technical, reason for per-resource avatars.

If the avatar image is _not_ per-resource, then every connected resource 
needs to know immediately when another resource changes the image. 
Otherwise the next time it sent a &lt;presence&gt; element it would send out a 
stale hash for the old image.

However, this kind of notification won't happen by default since you 
don't receive &lt;presence&gt; elements from your own resources (right?). I 
guess you could make it happen by adding yourself to your own roster, 
but that seems kind of awkward. And there's still a potential for race 
conditions if two resources try to simultaneously change the image.

It's the same fundamental thing I said in the other email: Avatar push 
is done as part of presence; presence is per-resource; therefore avatars 
should be per-resource.
