<PRE>Probably referring to me since you used my XDB++, and I think I'm the
only person to use that so far ;-)

It's still a conceptual thing, and I would love to have design talks
around it.  Anyone really interested in this should probably join the
jablein dev list.  I would also like people to ponder if XPath is
enough, or if you really need the full and complex XQuery.  Just a
thought.
