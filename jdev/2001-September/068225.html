The only problem that I see with this is that the solution that Jabber took for 
interoperating with Yahoo, ICQ, AIM, MSN, etc. is a kluge. If I have a buddy on one of 
those systems I still have to have an account on one of those systems to communicate 
with them, even if I never launch my IM for that specific system again.

Within the Jabber Environment, (I.e. from jabber server to jabber server) I do not have a 
problem. I can communicate with you if you are on a different Jabber Server, because in 
one way or another jabber servers pass the messages for me.

&gt;<i>From what little I read, about all that the microsoft offering provides is access to your 
</I>account when logging into another platform. and making use of that platform only to 
communicate with people on the host system your account belongs on. Little more than 
what I can do with my ATM card at a competitors bank ATM. I can manage my account 
and withdraw money. Maybe. If I have an account at the bank the ATM belongs to (or 
rather is &quot;responsible for&quot;) I can even get money from the ATM without paying aditional 
fees. So long as I limit myself to the account at that bank.

Jabber comes closest to a solution for this with the transport system. I can communicate 
with IM users on other platforms. I still have to have an account with that other system 
however.

I think I will go back to bed. Let me know when there is a client available that allows me 
to communicate with my friends on whatever platform
