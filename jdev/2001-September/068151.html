Well, this is all true except that I suspect most people who can't grasp the idea of a unique identifier are not very likely to be running multiple clients at once.  Now I can see that in the near future they might be running multiple apps that are Jabber enabled... maybe these apps could adopt the convention of asking for a location and prepending it with the app name: &quot;Gabber_Home&quot;??  I do this sometimes myself because my friends know what features I have available based on what client I'm running.  Obviously this is a default that the user can override with any resource they want but it would be a more meaningful and unique resource.

Also, isn't a user far more likely to try to run the *same* client from two locations than two clients on the same machine?  In this scenario, they still won't be able to log in and won't know why...  hmm, actually, I guess the newer connection always bumps the older one... but if their first client automatically reconnects.....
