Not yet. I had to finish up implementing feature #n-1 before I could get 
to this one. But I've started coding now.

How much server space do we really waste? Remember that we have agreed 
on an 8k limit for the pictures (and in my experience the JPEGs will be 
about 2k). It takes a lot of those to eat up any meaningful amount of 
storage.

I would be sad if we had to make avatars per-account. That prevents you 
from doing many creative things like
- showing a picture appropriate for the location (i.e. wearing a suit 
for at work, a Hawaiian shirt for at home)
- showing a different picture per state (or just for whatever reason, 
like happy or sad faces)
- periodically updating your picture from a live webcam
