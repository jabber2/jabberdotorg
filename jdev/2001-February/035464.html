</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Reply after each section of comments...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have you tried changing the &lt;ip /&gt; section in your jabber.xml? I use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;ip port=3D'5225' /&gt; for a lot of my personal testing, works great, still d=
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oes with final.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
  Of course I tried changing the ip section of my configuration file, the pth
module doesn't work, because it is hard coded to the jabber ports.  Look at my
original posting to see the lines that contain the 5222 and 5269 ports.


&gt;&gt;<i> I am the maintainer of the AIM Transport and I battled this for 3 hours and yes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is a known problem =3D) I'll have a fix put together soon for it. In the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meantime you can compile it by going into the src directory and running the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compilation by hand, including all the .c files as well as those in the libfaim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subdirectory. I'm not going to support this method (read: don't ask me how),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so unless you understand how to use the compiler fully I would suggest against
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
I tried to compile it by hand and it blows up at the linking stage with the error
I gave.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Compilation in some cases can be a bear, and we're trying to cope with this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We're working on a tool called jbox. It will know how to compile, installand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configure different jabber packages. Watch for it soon.
</I>
Actually I finally used the absolute path to the jabberd directory in the yahoo
./configure set and it worked. Now my only problem is that the documentation hasn't
been updated to the 1.4 version. :)

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have you played with the jabber.xml settings for logging? They are decent and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide a whole lot of options, although it sounds like you may need to write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a quick module to do some of the updates you are looking for.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
Jabberd has logging?  Will each modules give a status every X number of minutes
telling me how many messages and the number of bytes processed since the last status


&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm sorry but I disagree, the jabber server is distributed as a system designed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to compile itself, not any random thing that people stick in it. If you are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developing a new component or module for the jabber server it is not difficult
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to add it in to the build system, or have your own external build system. Again,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jbox will help solve some of these problems.
</I>
I am vaguely offended by your comment.  I am not sticking random things in the
directory, I am placing an authentication module that authenticates users against
a global registration system with several million entries using xml over http.  It
will make my life easier to simply place the module into the directory and have it
compile rather than have to edit two different make files each in a different directory
everytime I upgrade to a new project.  It is certainly not difficult, but it is somewhat
annoying, especially when it is trivial to fix the problem.

And what happens when I have 50 extra modules that different people have written that
I want to include, certainly you aren't even recommending that I hand edit two different
make files with 50 different entries every time jabber.org comes out with a new release?

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It sounds like you want to be using xdb. Look at the xdb_get and xdb_set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functions.
</I>
No, if you add a new section to the jabber config file the system won't start because it
complains about the configuration file being wrong.  I can modify the configo function to
handle this, but I find doing this to be kinda annoying.  Ideally it would simply parse
unknown sections for retrieval by another module later.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would seem that a lot of your problems come due to poor documentation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's always been a hard issue for us, as many of the developers do some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation, but we find ourselves spending most of our time on the core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system. As soon as the new website backend goes live (one of my current top
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> priorities) I plan to spend significant time doing documentation. Expect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> status reports to the list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --temas
</I>
Thanks, good documentation would be appreciated.
