<PRE>Yes!  Please!

It is getting very busy, and I have no interest (at the moment) in wading
thought all the &quot;How do you compile &lt;something&gt; on &lt;some Linux platform&gt;
using &lt;some version of Jabber server&gt;&quot; messages, but I am really interested
in client development, and general Jabber architecture design threads.

I would suggest three lists:

- Server install and config
- Client development
- Jabber architecture

Comments?

Michael.

Subject: [JDEV] should we split this email list?


&gt;<i> Having read JDEV religiously since August, I've been wondering if we
</I>should
&gt;<i> split this email list in two lists--one for Jabber developers and one for
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber administrators.  Here's my thinking, and tell me if I'm wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like there are really two sets of people who read this
</I>list--people
&gt;<i> developing software based on Jabber (clients, servers, transports, etc.)
</I>and
&gt;<i> people installing and administering Jabber servers.  Early on, I think
</I>these
&gt;<i> groups were one and the same, but as Jabber matures and becomes more and
</I>&gt;<i> more popular, I see the group of people USING Jabber--and by &quot;using&quot; I
</I>mean
&gt;<i> running Jabber servers for fun or profit--vastly outnumbering the group of
</I>&gt;<i> people developing Jabber software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Look at Apache as an analogy.  How many people run Apache?  Now, how many
</I>&gt;<i> people write Apache mods or fix bugs in the server code?  Jabber is
</I>quickly
&gt;<i> headed to the same distribution of interested parties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I have another related supposition and that is that some Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> software developers get turned off by the high volume of install/config
</I>&gt;<i> related traffic on JDEV and tune out of the list.  And that's bad, just as
</I>&gt;<i> the flipside is bad--that people who just want to help each other get the
</I>&gt;<i> latest Yahoo! transport working get turned off by all the talk about
</I>&gt;<i> building SSL enabled clients and the esoterics of XML grammar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think what's inevitable is that there will have to be some kind of split
</I>&gt;<i> to keep the respective groups' S/N ratios high, perhaps into JDEV and a
</I>&gt;<i> JADMIN lists.  What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Todd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ps.  One other thing I've noticed over the months is that whatever the
</I>list
&gt;<i> is called, we need an FAQ that is regularly maintained and is sent to all
</I>&gt;<i> new subscribers to the list.  I can't count the number of times someone
</I>asks
&gt;<i> a question on Wednesday, someone else answers it on Thursday, and then by
</I>&gt;<i> Monday a newcomer asks the same question (and usually gets ignored,
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> pps.  Ironically, I fit into both the JDEV and JADMIN groups.  I'd
</I>subscribe
&gt;<i> to JDEV, as I'm the maintainer of the Jabber Tcl client.  But I'd also
</I>&gt;<i> subscribe to JADMIN, since I'm responsible for Jabber.com's public Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> server and also provide commercial tech support to other administrators of
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber servers.  Maybe everyone's like me, but I doubt it.
</I>&gt;<i>
