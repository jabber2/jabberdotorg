</I>&gt;<i> Jabber Server 1.4 Released
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The sources can be found at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.4/final/">http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.4/final/</A> (binaries and packages
</I>&gt;<i> available in contrib).  Besides being our easiest release ever in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of installation and ongoing administration, the 1.4 server
</I>&gt;<i> contains a general round of bug fixes and stability enhancements,
</I>&gt;<i> making it the most stable Jabber server platform to date. The focus of
</I>&gt;<i> development has been on stabilizing the server architecture introduced
</I>&gt;<i> in 1.2, enabling all of the standard services (including transports)
</I>&gt;<i> to work smoothly, and adding many new features. The entire server team
</I>&gt;<i> has worked hard to ensure that the 1.4 release is an incredible IM
</I>&gt;<i> platform and a significant step forward in advancing Jabber as an open
</I>&gt;<i> XML architecture.  Because of the increased stability of the 1.4
</I>&gt;<i> server as well as the availability of improved transports and other
</I>&gt;<i> server add-ons to coincide with this release, now is a great time to
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade your old 1.0 or 1.2 server. To make this easier, we have been
</I>&gt;<i> putting more effort into documentation, and there is a new HOWTO for
</I>&gt;<i> the 1.4 server that is now available at <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/.">http://docs.jabber.org/.</A> In
</I>&gt;<i> addition, we've created a new mailing list especially for Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> server administrators, the sign-up page is located at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/jadmin/.">http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/jadmin/.</A>  The 1.4 server is
</I>&gt;<i> available in various formats for many platforms and has been built
</I>&gt;<i> successfully on a wide range of Linux and Unix platforms. If there is
</I>&gt;<i> not a package or binary available for your platform, it is very easy
</I>&gt;<i> to build from source and should work on almost every Unix platform.
</I>&gt;<i> There is also a 'make static' option available for platforms that do
</I>&gt;<i> not have the standard dynamic loading capabilities. In addition, a
</I>&gt;<i> combined and pre-configured package of all the transports and base
</I>&gt;<i> server should be available shortly.  Compatible versions of all of the
</I>&gt;<i> major transports/services are available with this release as separate
</I>&gt;<i> tarballs and are very easy to add to the base server (see the HOWTO
</I>&gt;<i> for details). While some of these are officially still in beta, the
</I>&gt;<i> quality of the transports has improved dramatically and release
</I>&gt;<i> candidate or final versions will be available in the coming weeks. The
</I>&gt;<i> components currently available are:   Conference (supports the 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> presence-based and 1.4 draft protocols)   Jabber Users Directory
</I>&gt;<i> (limited non-DB version for small servers only, the mysql and perl
</I>&gt;<i> based 'users-agent' is preferred for larger installations)   IRC (1.4
</I>&gt;<i> draft conferencing support only, will be available shortly)   AIM,
</I>&gt;<i> ICQ, MSN, Yahoo   The recent protocol enhancements supported at this
</I>&gt;<i> time (some client-side and some server-side) are listed at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/draft-proto/">http://docs.jabber.org/draft-proto/</A> and include:   authentication:
</I>&gt;<i> support for zero-knowledge authentication, for more secure login
</I>&gt;<i> browsing: a friendly way for clients and users to access the list of
</I>&gt;<i> services available on a server or for a user   cryptography: support
</I>&gt;<i> for end-to-end encryption of messages and presence   message
</I>&gt;<i> expiration: allow a user to specify how long a message should be
</I>&gt;<i> stored offline before being deleted   message formatting: support for
</I>&gt;<i> XHTML-Basic to format messages   server dialback: a security mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> to prevent server spoofing   time-based queries: querying sevice
</I>&gt;<i> uptime, user last-login times, and client idle time   xml storage:
</I>&gt;<i> generic xml can be stored in any namespace under a user account
</I>&gt;<i> privately or made public so that anyone can access it   conferencing:
</I>&gt;<i> an extensible protocol for managing and accessing the list of
</I>&gt;<i> participants in a multi-party conference room  New administration
</I>&gt;<i> features in 1.4 include:   general server-wide announcement messages
</I>&gt;<i> automatic welcome messages after registration   message of the day,
</I>&gt;<i> delivered only once after next login   administrators can browse to
</I>&gt;<i> view the list of online users   users can have certain groups in their
</I>&gt;<i> roster that are automatically managed and configured   As with 1.2,
</I>&gt;<i> extensibility is an important focus and continues to advance with this
</I>&gt;<i> version. The architecture is fundamentally a distributed xml-based
</I>&gt;<i> component architecture, so any piece can be replaced or distributed
</I>&gt;<i> across the network in any language and new components can be added
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically to the server similiarly to adding cgi scripts to a web
</I>&gt;<i> server. The session manager component also contains a module API
</I>&gt;<i> allowing server logic and user packet processing to be modified or
</I>&gt;<i> extended. The data access layer (XDB) is also abstraced allowing user
</I>&gt;<i> and server data to be stored in any data source; files (default), SQL
</I>&gt;<i> database, LDAP, etc. Socket management is also abstracted, allowing
</I>&gt;<i> socket handling to be implemented in a platform or performance
</I>&gt;<i> specific way (a new Linux-based scaling socket multiplexer project is
</I>&gt;<i> being started in conjunction with the Open Source Development Lab).
</I>&gt;<i> Taking a peek into the future, the server team is going to be focusing
</I>&gt;<i> on the 1.4.X series for some time. This release is the first stable
</I>&gt;<i> platform that we are all excited about and plan on building on top of.
</I>&gt;<i> Look for upcoming point releases that enhance stability, performance,
</I>&gt;<i> and farming-based configurations. The server team and other members of
</I>&gt;<i> the Jabber community are already working on many new components that
</I>&gt;<i> will transparently extend the Jabber platform even further, such as
</I>&gt;<i> http (web based clients, SOAP), email/SMTP, VoIP (SIP), whiteboarding
</I>&gt;<i> (SXPM and SVG), calendaring, and many more.  The 1.4 server gives us a
</I>&gt;<i> solid, long-lasting platform for instant messaging as well as for
</I>&gt;<i> developing of a variety of exciting new applications that make use of
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber to tap into information and connect people together. Your
</I>&gt;<i> feedback is welcome and we hope you'll join the conversation!
