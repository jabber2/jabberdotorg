<PRE>Quoth Jonathan Siegle &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jsiegle at psu.edu</A>&gt;:
|<i> I am looking into using kerberos authentication for my server. The
</I>|<i> user-user example in the kerberos sample code suggests that I open another
</I>|<i> port to do the auth. My question is: would it be difficult to create an
</I>|<i> xml tag to the kerberos auth over the standard jabber port or should I
</I>|<i> just do the auth over the kerberos port and send the result to the server.
</I>|<i> I am thinking it would be easier to do the second solution, but would I
</I>|<i> take a performance hit by doing it this way.
</I>
No, I think you have the right idea.  I don't know user/user Kerberos,
so I can't say why they call for a separate connection, but then if
you're looking at a normal server based authentication you don't have
to worry about user/user.

The system works like this:
  1. Client connects to server.  This first, so it's clear who the
     actual server turns out to be.  (In practice you probably have
     only one server, but in theory it could be cluster and you need
     the specific host.)
  2. Client gets jabber/jabberservice.psu.edu service ticket from the
     Kerberos KDC, sends it to the application server.  Along with the
     user identity _and_ the authenticated principal.
  3. Server decrypts/verifies service ticket with its key.
  4. Server makes up an encrypted mutual authentication reply, sends
     it back to the client.
  5. Client decrypts the reply, verifying bona fide application server.

That takes one round trip.  The tickets are just blocks of data, you
can base 64 encode them or something and drop them in the XML stream.

Now, the politically correct perspective is that you should use GSSAPI
to handle the Kerberos transaction.  (I assume you are working with
Kerberos 5.)  It's theoretically able to accommodate other authentication
options, and I'm told it's similar enough to the Microsoft Kerberos
(SSPI?) API that they're relatively easily adapted to each other, though
of course (go, US Dept. of Justice!) neither directly supports the other.

I believe that to do it right, you have to give GSS the opportunity
to decide how many trips it needs.  GSS-Kerberos needs only the same
1 round trip, but if you provide for only that, you're sort of defeating
the purpose if any of the alternative authentications could need more.
I personally think that if that's a big problem for the application
protocol, then sort it out later and implement today what you have to
work with today.

When I was looking at this, the protocol and server architecture worked
out fine, at least for the 1-round-trip model.  I didn't do so well for
clients, though, since I could not find a client to try it with that
looked like it was worth bothering with, where I could modify the library
level source and build on a useful range of platforms.  That must have
gotten better since, or were you going to write your own application?
