<PRE>Hello there to all of you jabber's.  
I'm hoping some of you can help me with a search I am conducting.  I am working with a Web-based instant communications company and they are in need of a Dir or VP of Engineering.  They are a start-up, founded in 1999, have approx 25 employees, and are gearing up to rock and roll.  I am working with the CEO on this project, so if any of you are at that level, or know of any entrepreneurs who are, please let me know, and I will make sure the CEO sees their resume.  This is an absolutely fantastic time to join a company where stock options is the name of the game (plus they are well funded and willing to pay for top talent).  On top of the awesome opportunity, they are a really fun group of people, very causual, where flexibility and having fun is manditory.
I can be reached via email, or by phone at the number listed below.  Thank you for putting on your thinking caps for me.
