<PRE>I'm obviously doing something wrong or there is something wrong with my
configuration.  I just brought up 1.4RC, and it is behaving the same way
that 1.2 behaved for me.  I can use a client to connect with a new user, but
when that user quits and then tries to come back in, the user can't connect.
Right now WinJab can't even make that initial connection.  Both WinJab and
JabberIM show a 10061 socket error (MyJabber says that the user is
unauthorized on the server).  On the server side, I basically just see login
fail messages.   On the 1.2 server I was seeing access problems to the spool
directory.  It would claim no such file or directory when it (and the xml
files) did exist and the jabber user had full access.  It seems to read the
xml file now, but denies access.

I am sitting on an Intranet behind a firewall.  However, the clients and
server are are on the same ethernet segment.  I compiled both jabber servers
with gcc.  I am running them on a two processor Alpha under Redhat 7.0.  The
clients I am using are all windows based; I've tried WinJab, JabberIM, and
MyJabber.  Any idea as to what I might be doing wrong?  I think I've read
all of the relevant documentation, but I haven't seen anything like this.
Thanks for any help.

Cheers--

Al Gaspar
