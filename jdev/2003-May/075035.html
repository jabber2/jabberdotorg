By &quot;consumer service&quot;, do you mean MSN Messenger? So, that MSN Messenger 
isn't based on SIMPLE, but just another proprietary protocol? Of course, 
even if it would be based on SIMPLE, they still had to provide 
extensions, as SIMPLE doesn't support chat sessions.

Phew, still all a &quot;little&quot; bit complicated,
