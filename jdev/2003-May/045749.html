<PRE>Hello,

&lt;&lt;Please listen to me.&gt;&gt;

Nothing to get upset about: I wanted the buglist for one thing: Trying to
avoid features that are not stable in 1.4.2.  That's all.

&gt;<i> &lt;&lt;All I know is that if anyone is keeping a buglist, its not in any
</I>obvious
&gt;<i> location. Feel free to prove me wrong.&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Easy: Java's Bugparade. I have also dealt with several other
</I>[...]

&gt;<i> A &quot;hidden&quot; bug-list for a Open Source project seems to me it is defying
</I>the
&gt;<i> whole concept of Open Source !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the very least it is very unconvenient.
</I>
Please listen to me.

 - The jabberd 1.4 branch has not been worked on in any serious way for
   well over a year. All development effort (such that it is) is going
   towards the jabberd 2 project, which _does_ have an online buglist.

 - There might have been an online buglist for jabberd 1.4 in the past.
   I don't know; it was before my time. If there was one, it doesn't
   seem to be online any more.

 - If you have problems with jabberd 1.4, the best chance you have of
   getting them fixed is to post to JDEV and then, if you get no useful
   response, fix the problem yourself.

Its not a question of whether or not its a good idea to put a buglist
online - such a thing is useless unless there are people around to look
after it.

Its also worth noting that because a project is Open Source does not
require that resources are made available for assisting development on
the project.

As someone else noted, there is a fork of the jabberd 1.4 code called
WPJabber ( <A HREF="http://wpjabber.jabberstudio.org">http://wpjabber.jabberstudio.org</A> ) which is under active
development. You could begin using that and file bugs with that project.

Alternatively, you could take over management of the 1.4 codebase - talk
to OOB if you (or anyone else) want to pursue this further.

Rob.
