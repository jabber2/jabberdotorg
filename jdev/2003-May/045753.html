</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even if it would be based on SIMPLE, they still had to provide 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extensions, as SIMPLE doesn't support chat sessions.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I mean MSN Messenger. As far as I know, there is no support for
</I>&gt;<i> SIMPLE in MSN Messenger and there are no plans to switch MSN Messenger
</I>&gt;<i> from its proprietary protocol to SIMPLE (but of course what do I know

MSN version 4.7 on XP has a full SIP stack built in. This can be used to
access a communications service, or to access MS Exchange IM.

MSN accessing the public MSN service uses its own protocol (at the
moment anyway).

Their new Grenwich server is the basis for enterprise communications
services including SIP.
