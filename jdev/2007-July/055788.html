No, I haven't. This introduces new dependencies on the platform,
security and what else. When I write a PHP application, it's because of
its portability and wide support on web servers. Mostly.

</I>
That's even worse. Then I have the PHP runtime and the .NET runtime in
memory... I was going to look into ASP.NET or Mono on an Apache/Linux
server, but that's a different thing I guess.

</I>
Ruby on Rails sounds interesting. I've seen a short demo video of it
some time ago. I don't know how widely it is supported on web hosting
servers. I haven't installed it yet on mine, nor do I speak that
language yet.

&gt;<i> Have you considered trying to fix code.blitzaffe.com's code?
</I>
I think I have looked at it when I stumbled upon that problem. Not sure
why I didn't fix it. Either because I had no time or no sufficient
understanding of the code. As I said, complex XML in PHP always looks
like random [array] noise to me. Maybe I'll get back to it if the
situation doesn't change noticeable.
