So they are not XMPP-compliant. File a bug report. ;-)

RFCs are not updated, they are superseded. We'll start working on that 
after we have an XMPP interop event. Stay tuned for details, I'm 
planning that now.

&gt;<i> I think this topic has

</I>
I'd say that rfc3920bis will *not* get rid of the requirement for SASL. 
If anything, it will get rid of dialback (we could write that up in an 
informational RFC or historical JEP).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And since the RFC also states -

That is correct.

&gt;&gt;<i> Thats why I said that any server that advertises version=1.0 MUST also

You are correct.
