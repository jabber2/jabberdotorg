<PRE>HI Vinod!

&gt;<i>The RFC states that SASL must be done after TLS.  Though its not

</I>&gt;<i>question of TLS.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>... but you cannot tell me that TLS+dialback is worse than just 
unencrypted dialback. Therefore I think it has been a good idea to use 
the starttls extension on dialback as well.

&gt;<i>Regarding the issue of SASL EXTERNAL and support for subjectAltNames,
</I>&gt;<i>I dont think it is currently possible to have a valid certificate with
</I>&gt;<i>subjectAltName extensions since none of the CA's are supporting it.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Right. That's why as a fallback all server implementations I know check 
the CN if there is no subjectAltName extension.

&gt;<i>I think there should be something done for enabling federation between
</I>&gt;<i>servers using DIGEST-MD5 or even PLAIN.  Otherwise, this looks like a
</I>&gt;<i>no-go.  Servers will keep relying on dialback.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Using DIGEST-MD5 or PLAIN for interconnection between servers would mean 
that EVERY PAIR of jabber servers would have to agree on a shared 
secret. That's very much impractical.
