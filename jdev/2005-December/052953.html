<PRE>Hi Vinod,

I just wanted to mention that I ran into the same trouble.  When I was working 
on my server implementation, I had compatibility problems because other 
servers went against RFC 3920 by including version='1.0' in s2s when they 
didn't actually support SASL.

The RFC definitely needs to be updated about this.  I think this topic has 
come up often enough that it is not something to brush aside as an 
implementation note.  For now, servers implementors seem to be taking matters 
into their own hands, and so not only do we have 1.0 without SASL, but we 
have TLS+dialback.  These things are not in the RFC.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thats why I said that any server that advertises version=1.0 MUST also
