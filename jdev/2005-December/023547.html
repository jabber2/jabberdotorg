correction: I'm an 7-bit ascii kinda guy, the only reason I've ever
used the eight bit for anything was line-and-box-drawing, or typing
second language essay's at school.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but these two are invalid examples. Both &#1077; and &#1105; are kept and not

</I>
I thought that was the whole point of stringprep? (make similar chars
the same), but it seems not: RFC, section 9.1: &quot;&quot;stringprep does
nothing to map similar-looking characters together nor to prohibit
some characters because they look like others&quot;&quot;

The point of stringprep seems to be: (RFC, section 1): &quot;&quot;these
[stringprep] profiles will allow users to enter internationalized text
strings in applications and have the highest chance of getting the
content of the strings correct.  In this case, &quot;correct&quot; means that if
two different people enter what they think is the same string into two
different input mechanisms, the strings should match on a
character-by-character basis. [...] In addition to helping string
matching, profiles of stringprep can also exclude characters that
should not normally appear in text that is used in the protocol.&quot;&quot;

Having only ever lived and worked in a english centric world, I have
troubles understanding the issues that stringprep address, but I'm
trying!

I have this great concern that a lot of xmpp developers might think
the same thoughts that I thought the first time I looked at
stringprep, mainly:  &quot;&quot;It's too hard, and I don't understand it, and
my application works at the moment, so why should I care?&quot;&quot;   Then two
months after the release of your code, you get some
spanish/polish/russian guy using non-english characters telling you
that 'your program doesn't work', because you were too lazy to figure
out stringprep.
