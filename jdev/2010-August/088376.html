</I>There are always attacks like this. A malicious user can generate  
thousands of fake resources without PEP, and you still need to track  
them in order to do presence optimization.


&gt;&gt;<i> Honestly, I don't find PEP too much of a pain - it does have a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cost, but it's really not astronomical, and the benefits are very  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for clients and users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We choosed another approach in ejabberd, where we don't store

</I>&gt;<i> wondered:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) caps_hash-&gt;features table is only for *local* users. The  
</I>&gt;<i> overhead is really small for obvious reason.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) since we already store local user's presence in C2S state (this  
</I>&gt;<i> is MUST in RFC), a server filters out *every* outgoing PEP message  
</I>&gt;<i> (based on caps from user's presence and features from  
</I>&gt;<i> caps_hash-&gt;features table) right before sending the message to the  
</I>&gt;<i> local user. No memory, no cpu overhead here.
</I>
So you're snooping all messages even from remote sources to guess if  
they're PEP events intended to be filtered? How would you know? If I  
(or my client) explicitly subscribes to a particular node on  
PEP/PubSub-onna-jid service, you'd filter it out anyway.


&gt;<i> 3) for S2S users a server sends PEP message blindly to bare JID. In  
</I>&gt;<i> fact this doesn't even violate the XEP :)
</I>
I'm struggling to understand how that does not violate the XEP?

auto-subscribe is defined as a depth=all items subscription to the  
root node from the bare_jid, and filtered-notifications then only  
sends the notifications to those full jids that have requested them.  
Both are required for PEP. I don't see how you can claim to be  
conformant to PEP without doing both.

So because you filter on the subscriber's end, you restrict  
PubSub-onna-jid to the PEP subset, and because you don't filter on  
the service end, you break even that if the subscriber isn't on  
ejabberd.

So you end up with a interop matrix like:

Subscriber -&gt;
v Service		ejabberd	Standard
ejabberd		PEP		No
Standard		PEP		Full

I don't see why you think this is a good thing.

Dave.
