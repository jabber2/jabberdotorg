There is also a possibility where a malicious user can generate 
thousands of fake resources with different caps/features which you 
should also track. A server should also have a protection against this, 
especially if it is a small server.

We choosed another approach in ejabberd, where we don't store anything 
except of caps_hash-&gt;features hash table. If you are wondered:

1) caps_hash-&gt;features table is only for *local* users. The overhead is 
really small for obvious reason.
2) since we already store local user's presence in C2S state (this is 
MUST in RFC), a server filters out *every* outgoing PEP message (based 
on caps from user's presence and features from caps_hash-&gt;features 
table) right before sending the message to the local user. No memory, no 
cpu overhead here.
3) for S2S users a server sends PEP message blindly to bare JID. In fact 
this doesn't even violate the XEP :)

So I suggest adding two &quot;SHOULD&quot; statements in the XEP:
1) a server SHOULD filter PEP messages before sending it to local user.
2) a server SHOULD broadcast bare PEP message to all available local 
user's resources.
