<PRE>Hey everyone,


Since I took on the role of Openfire project lead, the Openfire developers
have been working amazingly hard across almost every part of the server's
code, with a view to making a new release we can all be really proud of.


After a huge amount of work, the Openfire team is really excited to
announce we've reached a beta state with the 3.10.0 release, available from
<A HREF="http://www.igniterealtime.org/downloads/beta.jsp">http://www.igniterealtime.org/downloads/beta.jsp</A>


This release aims to improve security and stability over the current 3.9.3
stable release, provides a set of important new protocol extensions, and
modernizes the XMPP core protocol support - in short, this is going to be
the release we wanted to make.


While this is a beta release, we're not recommending it for critical
production use; however this is running on igniterealtime.org itself and
developer sites, and we'd appreciate people trying it out in non-critical
production cases.


We're hoping it'll reach full release rapidly, and we'll be welcoming
experiences of anyone deploying so we can add that last polish. Having
dealt with the last remaining blocking bug, we're expecting this to move to
a final stable release within a week or two.


Dave.
