</I>I am talking about Adam Theos Ransom License on the theoretic-smtp
jabber gateway.

I find it amusing and annoying on the positive side,  Even creative.

On the negative side I feel violated having seen this source code, now
how can I implement the same under a GPL without getting into a nasty
conflict? Why should I get source code out of CVS that I have to
delete?
I just did a &quot;co .&quot; to get all the branches.

QUOTE &quot;3 Once the evaluation period ends, you agree to either
purchase a registered copy of the software at usd$5.00, or immediately
stop any further use, copying and modification of the software and any
modifications and to destroy all such copies or modifications.&quot;

I mean come on! What type of BS is that? Sure Adam is only 21 years
old,   but it is a bit silly.

I have written my questions to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">theo at theoretic.com</A> before, and have
gotten no statement from him. The point is, that it is ok, I would say
to put it on his own web server, but what is it doing on the jabber
server? 
Do you have to delete the source code from your server after 30 day?

There is not anything really special about this source code, and
<A HREF="http://www.jabberstudio.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/theoretic-smtp/jabber.pl?rev=1.6&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">http://www.jabberstudio.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/theoretic-smtp/jabber.pl?rev=1.6&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup</A>
is missing any license statement.

Also , how can I contribute to jabber if we are not all playing on the
same level playing ground? 

Also, adam has been pushing to get jabber into DotGNU, 
project and I have not wanted to make a big deal about it, but
jabber is now an officially endorsed project.

But it is strange that I cannot even use his contribution as part of a
GNU software,
the license is totally unacceptable for a free software project and
represents an inpurity that has to be removed.

Dont take me as being negative,
I think that he should be able to license his ideas and software as
he likes, but not mixing it up with free software. I dont want anything
to do wiht this ransom license for my software that is under GPL.

If you feel that this is good, then collect the money,
pay him off, and remove the license. Otherwise you will just scare
people off.

Best Regards,
James Michael DuPont
