I'm not that familiar with HTTP either, but the main reason for choosing it would be 
that that's what most people use today in their clients and the availability for libraries 
for it. During the signaling fase a client could specify that it only support HTTP GET, 
but that means it would loose the ability to transfer files if it is behind a firewall. Maybe 
we shouldn't specify HTTP as the way to transfer files at all (also concerning what 
you point out below, about how far we should go in telling people how to implement 
their clients).

&gt;&gt;<i> This ofcourse still leaves the need for better p2p signaling. Best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be ofcourse to combine both of them, letting both clients
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indicate wich options they have and then choosing the best one

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best is a good idea rather then argueing about wether inband is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good or bad..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I fully agree. The question is not, *if* one should use the server 
</I>&gt;<i>for file transfers or not, but *in what situations* it is best to use 
</I>&gt;<i>inband data, depending on the capabilities/attributes of the clients 
</I>&gt;<i>(and the server) and the actual load(s).
</I>&gt;<i>Example 1: After a chat, I'd like to transfer a file to my friend, 
</I>&gt;<i>using DSL. He has only a 56K modem, has started three downloads and 
</I>&gt;<i>the network of his ISP is already on its knees. But the load on the 
</I>&gt;<i>jabber server is low and I wouldn't have any problems to transfer the 
</I>&gt;<i>file to the server. So I (or my client) uses the server. This 
</I>&gt;<i>solution is user-friendly, because I can go offline directly after 
</I>&gt;<i>transmission and my friend can first download the other three files 
</I>&gt;<i>and later decide to download mine. It is ISP-friendly, because I 
</I>&gt;<i>don't cause much traffic for my own ISP and if my friend is 
</I>&gt;<i>responsible enough to download the file somewhat later, it's better 
</I>&gt;<i>for his own ISP as well.
</I>
This would be sort of like the jabber.com situation, simply uploading a file somewhere 
and then having someone else download it. But if this is, as someone pointed about 
this would make us the &quot;hotmail&quot; of filetransfering. In this case the file is probably not 
even send inband (since it doesn't directly reach the other user), wich means you 
have to open second connection after all, etc. etc.

&gt;<i>Example 2: We're only chatting, my friend doesn't download anything 
</I>&gt;<i>else. The load on the Jabber server is high, almost nothing gets 
</I>&gt;<i>through. It is possible for my friend to establish a direct 
</I>&gt;<i>connection to my client's HTTP server and download the file. In this 
</I>&gt;<i>case, wouldn't that be the better solution?
</I>
It would be better.. during the signaling fase the clients would discover that you are 
not behind a firewall and decide to do it that way. If they discover you are behind a 
firewal they would have to decided to let you upload it. If this is not possible either they 
could decide on doing the tranfer inband (with a big warning: &quot;this is only for small 
files, it will slow your connection if the file is too big, etc.), or havig you transfer it to 
some other server, and having your friend download it (like you describe above).

&gt;<i>What I don't like about all that is:
</I>&gt;<i>a) Although we want to implement an IM client, we're thinking about 
</I>&gt;<i>problems and asking questions how to implement the most efficient 
</I>&gt;<i>file sharing peer-to-peer application.
</I>
Well, I'm not just thinking about implementing an IM client, I'm thinking of the best way 
to transfer binary data from JID to the other, I really think this (espc. inband data) has 
more usefull applications then just filetransfering in IM applications.

&gt;<i>b) The rules to be applied after the signaling you're talking about 
</I>&gt;<i>could become complicated. How far should we go? Determine them 
</I>&gt;<i>manually, once and for all, based on rather theoretical assumptions? 
</I>&gt;<i>Work on them based on empirical data gained from real networks? 
</I>&gt;<i>Invent a highly sophisticated algorithm based on statistics/machine 
</I>&gt;<i>learning which is able to adapt to changes in the network and to 
</I>&gt;<i>predict future network load, leading to better decisions? Wouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i>*that* go even far beyond HTTP, making things for clients highly 
</I>&gt;<i>complicated instead of keeping it simple?
</I>
Whatever action you're going to undertake if you want to keep it simple just 
predetermine what action you're going to undertake For example: sending filetranfers 
should always be p2p not inband.
Or these small midi files I want to send along with my messages should always be 
inband, not p2p. (Good example of where inband has huge advantages over 
p2p-HTTP.. you don't want to wait till all these connections get established etc.)

We should provide a way for clients to let them be aware of each others capabilities 
for transfering binary data, including their &quot;firewall situation&quot;. There is already a JEP for 
feature negotiation wich I think we should use for this. I do think we should provide a 
standard for filetransfer (it be HTTP or something else) to increase competability, but 
that we should not make it mandatory: just recommend clients to implement it. After 
all there is more then just filetransfer outthere, what would prevent me from sending 
you the adress to a shoutcast stream, or initiating a videoconferencing stream etc. 
etc. 

&gt;<i>I think the problem here is that with any data (let's say three 
</I>&gt;<i>times) bigger than the average message a user would normally send to 
</I>&gt;<i>another user (by using a keyboard), we're more or less leaving the 
</I>&gt;<i>realm of instant messaging. Though applications can *use* the Jabber 
</I>&gt;<i>protocol for their own instant messaging needs (p2p, a2p, a2a), also 
</I>&gt;<i>leaving the area of pure GUI IM clients, nevertheless the Jabber 
</I>&gt;<i>protocol is (and should remain, IMO) an open protocol for instant 
</I>&gt;<i>messaging. Everything else is file sharing and those protocols are 
</I>&gt;<i>fundamentally different from IM.
</I>
Agreed... inband data should always remain small. As someone pointed out here 
though, an imagine of what you typed could be smaller then what you actually typed in 
some cases :) I don't agree really agree with you yet on *how* small though, since 
there is already data being transfered inside messages more then 3 times bigger, but 
I'll assume that that was just an example.
Jabber is more then just IM, and if it wants to be able to be used for non-IM purposes 
(like in DotGNU) it should be able to handle messages quite large. Lot's of people 
working on Jabber don't think it is or should be just an open protocol for instant 
messaging...

&gt;<i>So either combine IM and file sharing in one app, but use different 
</I>&gt;<i>protocols underneath - or invoke a thirdparty app based on the URL 
</I>&gt;<i>the client got out-of-band, like browsers can invoke telnet when 
</I>&gt;<i>getting URLs like <A HREF="telnet://213.123.466.237">telnet://213.123.466.237</A> ...
</I>
I will need inband tranfering of binary data (small images for example) for some of my 
applications, since I don't have the option of using a different protocol or a thirdparty 
app. And yes one of my applications is an IM application. I think it's important to have 
this capability and to have decent feature negotation for it, as well as p2p tranfers. 
(simply sending a URI will not solve the firewall problems)
