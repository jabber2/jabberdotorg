<PRE>Took a few days :( but the secret was in this:

<A HREF="http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/gcc.html#gcc2952-fixes">http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/gcc.html#gcc2952-fixes</A>

!! WARNING: DO NOT USE WINZIP OR SOME SUCH WINDOWS TOOL TO UNPACK.
              That will certainly screw up hard links and you'll end up with
              a non-working system. And, please do resist the impulse to
send
              me email telling me that I am wrong about this.  !!

After I followed the *nix instructions for building (manually decompressing)
it worked first time.
This should be put into the howto at
<A HREF="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/howto.html">http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/howto.html</A> really

Hope this helps some people anyway
