<PRE>&gt;<i>Guys, if you're going to take this offlist, can you please keep me on
</I>&gt;<i>the CC list?  This discussion may be wearing out its welcome on the JDEV
</I>&gt;<i>list, but that doesn't make me any less interested in finding out about
</I>&gt;<i>any interesting ideas you folks have.  If the Jabber community decides
</I>&gt;<i>to examine file transfer again at some future point, it'd be very good
</I>&gt;<i>to have this discussion lying around in an archive somewhere, so we
</I>&gt;<i>don't have to have it all over again then.  (Sadly, most discussions
</I>&gt;<i>I've seen go off-list end up disappearing in mid-argument, and a few
</I>&gt;<i>months later, they repeat themselves, before being taken off-list again,
</I>&gt;<i>only to die again.)
</I>&gt;<i> - Dave

Amongst everything at Jabberconf Europe I had a bit of a talk about this with Joe 
Hildebrand, Peter Saint Andre and others..  they might come out with a JEP about 
handeling inband filetransfer and out of band filetransfer signaling. Like pointed out 
before ofcourse feature negiotiation will handle part of this...  Had an intresting 
discussion about doing transfers outside the XML-stream but still over the same 
socket connection..
Dunno how long it will take before something will come up, Jabber people spread all 
over Europe right now :) (eg PSA in Prague, Joe in Italy I think, and Dizzy in Paris), and 
espc. after such a conference everyone is especially busy..
As for taking it off the list.. I don't think that's true since all discussion about the actual 
subject (filetransfer) stopped and turned into an in-band vs. out of band thing.. If you 
have someone usefull to discuss about maybe we can start it up again :)
