&gt;<i> Perhaps here is a problem with JabberSMTP being on JabberStudio. I have
</I>&gt;<i> not thought so until now, but if it is decided Jabberstudio is only for
</I>&gt;<i> free software (as in liberty) and open source projects, I will certainly
</I>&gt;<i> remove it from there, since it is not yet those things (but will be soon).
</I>
This isn't true.  I checked this with Temas before I got him to create a
project for Yabber on JabberStudio.  The answer (back then at least) was
that they were happy with propriety licence free software projects to be put
up, but it may not be appropriate to use CVS, as they couldn't guarantee the
security/privacy of any code put up. (Which is understandable)

I can't see why JS can't be a central place for Jabber projects of varying
licenses.  You are free to not use any particular code if you don't like the
terms.  Or maybe do something constructive like rewriting it as a GPL
project rather than making comments about the age of the author.  I agree
that maybe the CVS might not be the best place for code that is not covered
under an &quot;open&quot; license (yet)

I would actually like to make more use of JS myself, but many of the
features are still umm...somewhat &quot;funky&quot;.

Michael.
