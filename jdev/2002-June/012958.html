<PRE>&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>We are final year Electronics &amp; Communication Engg,
</I>&gt;<i>India. students and have been actively developing JAVA
</I>&gt;<i>applications for past two years. We are already Sun
</I>&gt;<i>Certified Programmers and are currently appearing for
</I>&gt;<i>Developer Certification. We have been following the
</I>&gt;<i>development of P2P movement and recognize the
</I>&gt;<i>importance such p2p apps will play. We have already
</I>&gt;<i>developed  a decentralized p2p file sharing system
</I>&gt;<i>based on truepeer model and have won First prize in
</I>&gt;<i>IEEE, National Level Technical Fest, organised by
</I>&gt;<i>student branch of our college.
</I>&gt;<i>We are very much interested in helping you to develop
</I>&gt;<i>Jabber(Yahoo-Transport) and other we can actively
</I>&gt;<i>contribute to.
</I>&gt;<i>Looking forward to a positive reply.
</I>
I think noone is working officially on the yahoo transport right now, but some patches 
to the yahoo transport have been made that are available on www.amessage.de or 
more specific <A HREF="http://www.amessage.de/patches/.">http://www.amessage.de/patches/.</A> This work was done by Matthias 
Wimmer (<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jabber at matthias-wimmer.de</A>), and I think he still subscribes to this list..

Like with most opensource projects, you don't have to sit around and ask for 
permission to develop something, just pick something you think is intresting or 
something you'd like to see in jabber and start building it :) If your ideas require a 
modification or addition to the jabber protocol you can submit a JEP, read more about 
JEPs here: <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/.">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/.</A> Note that if you already have a working 
implementation of these enhanchments your JEP has a better chance of being 
accepted, and that JEPs that break excisting client implementations don't stand 
much of a chance anymore these days (at least I'd hope so..).
