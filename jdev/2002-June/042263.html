<PRE>In-band transport of large payloads is something we and others have been
looking at pretty intensely. Obviously it would be a nice thing to have,
but it is also very, very difficult to do properly. If you just stick
base64 in an X element, you have huge problems because if that takes 10
minutes to transmit, you can't send anything else for those 10 minutes. You
could chunk them, but that hardly makes things simpler for the client
software. This also makes it massively more difficult to distinguish
legitimate traffic from a denial of service attack. Furthermore, it means
the server has to do a whole lot more XML processing (which may already be
a bottleneck), because all XML content has to be at least checked for
well-formedness. To speak nothing of the bandwidth implications.

Ultimately, I don't believe there is a satisfactory way to transport large
payloads in-band while keeping things simple for the client. The solution
to this problem will involve a more complex system on the client endpoints
- though not necessarily in typical client software.

I've set up jabberd and got a couple of clients connecting to it (winjab).
I
tried a file transfer which worked no problem. What I saw looking at the
Winjab source is that the receiver downloads the file from the sender on
it's own socket based connection.

I'm just thinking that there should be a better way to do this and inside
the message. I'm not saying my idea is the best or anything, but I do think
that it would present the client authors with less headaches. Anyway, my
idea is that a message element can have a child, let's say attachment or
even an x, which will contain the contents of the file. XML can handle this
if the file is base64 encoded, as it ends up as plain text.

Just some thoughts
