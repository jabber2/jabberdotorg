<PRE>I've set up jabberd and got a couple of clients connecting to it (winjab). I
tried a file transfer which worked no problem. What I saw looking at the
Winjab source is that the receiver downloads the file from the sender on
it's own socket based connection.

I'm just thinking that there should be a better way to do this and inside
the message. I'm not saying my idea is the best or anything, but I do think
that it would present the client authors with less headaches. Anyway, my
idea is that a message element can have a child, let's say attachment or
even an x, which will contain the contents of the file. XML can handle this
if the file is base64 encoded, as it ends up as plain text.

Just some thoughts
