&gt;<i> And alternative, would be to create a simple(-ish) PASS type component
</I>that
&gt;<i> would run as a service under WinNT/2000/XP or under Linux, and make it
</I>very
&gt;<i> simple for consumers to install.  When they install a client behind ICS or
</I>&gt;<i> other NAT box, you could make it very clear to them that they need to
</I>&gt;<i> install this PASS component on the gateway machine that has the private IP
</I>&gt;<i> address, or their files/voicechat/webcam etc will not work.  Of course
</I>this
&gt;<i> isn't going to help the people that use hardware NAT boxes, but they will
</I>&gt;<i> have to wait for UPnP I guess.
</I>
Thats good I like this local PASS component idea, this would mean not just
file transfers, but other oob data like voice and whiteboard etc could be
done, all you have to do it is in the client tell it where the PASS server
is, and the client connects to the PASS kind of like a server but with
little or no authentication to a local port that cannot be accessed from
outside on the internet (to prevent hackers etc on the internet taking
advantage of it) to tell it to setup ports like PASS for any purpose the
client might need.

Could also just use SOCKS5, but I dont think there are any good free SOCKS5
servers for windows platforms available, plus it wouldnt be as fun ;)
