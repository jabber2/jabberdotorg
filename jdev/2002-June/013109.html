<PRE>Guys, if you're going to take this offlist, can you please keep me on
the CC list?  This discussion may be wearing out its welcome on the JDEV
list, but that doesn't make me any less interested in finding out about
any interesting ideas you folks have.  If the Jabber community decides
to examine file transfer again at some future point, it'd be very good
to have this discussion lying around in an archive somewhere, so we
don't have to have it all over again then.  (Sadly, most discussions
I've seen go off-list end up disappearing in mid-argument, and a few
months later, they repeat themselves, before being taken off-list again,
only to die again.)

 - Dave

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I'm not even trying to do file transfers, just trying to keep the Jabber

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would clean mean a standard for inband data transfer rather then everyone

</I>&gt;<i> interoperatable with p2p datatransfers? I think so but everyone has the right to 
</I>&gt;<i> disagree with me ofcourse.. I'll look into SOAP over Jabber..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems there is no real intrest for this on the list though, most are Desktop Instant 
</I>&gt;<i> Messenger oriented perhaps? 
</I>&gt;<i> Or just too busy with others things to mix themselves in this lengthy partially offtopic 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion (that must be it), so this will be the last of it then...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Just to clarify, many ISPs, including us, *do not pay* (directly) for bytes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;between a dialup customer and &quot;the Internet&quot;, but DO pay for bytes between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;their servers and &quot;the Internet&quot;.  Therefore, inband data transmission will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cost $$$ in the latter case, but not in the former.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This.. well if you say so I believe you :) I assume this is American market? In the 
</I>&gt;<i> Netherlands most dailup ISPs make their profit by receiving kickback for every minute 
</I>&gt;<i> someone is connected by the telco's. If on top of that their data traffic is free then why 
</I>&gt;<i> are they all collapsing? Or does this simply mean your ISP outsources Dailup acces 
</I>&gt;<i> alltogether and just supplies the services like email, webhosting, support, etc. ?
</I>&gt;<i> Just wondering (I don't think a reply belongs on the list though, email perhaps?)...
