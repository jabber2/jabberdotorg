POP, IMAP and MAPI (Exchange) ARE NOT &quot;client-to-client&quot;, PLEASE!

sendmail is just an SMTP mail transfer agent program and no different than
any other SMTP mail transfer agent program like those from Netscape and
Microsoft...ARG!


&gt;<i>For
</I>&gt;<i>every byte send to a sendmail server, two bytes traverse the
</I>&gt;<i>network.  Most unfortunately, those two bytes always involve
</I>&gt;<i>just the one sendmail server and its attached network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What positives do you get for having the sendmail server involved
</I>&gt;<i>in a large file transaction between two parties?  You get a
</I>&gt;<i>guarantee of delivery and no need for continued storage on the
</I>&gt;<i>sending party's side (since the file 'moves' to the sendmail server).
</I>&gt;<i>If you're sending the file to multiple users at once, you get less
</I>&gt;<i>traffic on your local network (the server takes the load).
</I>&gt;<i>You also get an opportunity to mediate the file somehow (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i>virus checking it as a service, converting it from aac into mp3,
</I>&gt;<i>storing it for later delivery to other users..)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What positives do you get for not having the sendmail server
</I>&gt;<i>involved?  The network on the sendmail server sees 0X load
</I>&gt;<i>rather than 2X load; the latency is lower; the sendmail server
</I>&gt;<i>has no storage requirement; and you have arguably fewer points
</I>&gt;<i>of failure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Pragmatically, taking the load off the server is more valuable
</I>&gt;<i>in the normal case than replicating HTTP/FTP/SMTP/FXP yet again.
</I>&gt;<i>The fact that 'SMTP does it' is not a great rationale for forcing
</I>&gt;<i>all the jabber servers to pay 2X bandwidth costs for file transfers
</I>&gt;<i>between their users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>F.
