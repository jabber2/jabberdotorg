<PRE>Where to start...

#1, the server has to get involved bandwidth wise in a client to client
transfer.  This is bad from a cost perspective, not to mention the gallons
of oil it will cost in the end. :)
#2, the server has to get involved from a load and storage perspective.  If
the sending client is on a T1 and the receiver is on 28k, disconnecting and
connecting during transer... Having the server manage that mess is
non-workable
#3, base64 encoding expands the size by 33%, which is unacceptable for a
file of any real size.

I guess it's a valid question to ask is there a file size (e.g. 5k) below
which encapsulating it in a message would be acceptable...  I think it would
probably encourage bad design, but could see a convenience argument...

Subject: [JDEV] File transfers


I've set up jabberd and got a couple of clients connecting to it (winjab). I
tried a file transfer which worked no problem. What I saw looking at the
Winjab source is that the receiver downloads the file from the sender on
it's own socket based connection.

I'm just thinking that there should be a better way to do this and inside
the message. I'm not saying my idea is the best or anything, but I do think
that it would present the client authors with less headaches. Anyway, my
idea is that a message element can have a child, let's say attachment or
even an x, which will contain the contents of the file. XML can handle this
if the file is base64 encoded, as it ends up as plain text.

Just some thoughts
Andy Beetz
