There is no right way. At least not yet. Client to client 'data' transfers
are fine, no problem as long as a single or range of ports can be agreed
upon. As long as everyone uses the same protocol again everything should be
cool. Which I think it needs to be specced out.

Standardizing a client port or ports and protocol would be beneficial to
everyone.

Corporate network admins, if company policy is to block data transfers into
and out of the company, there is a nice and easy target for the firewall
rules, the clients should not be able to bypass the firewall. If they want
to do content filtering, there could be a component on the jabber server
which intercepts the oob packet (if this were the way it was done), waits to
see if the receiver wants to accept, if so download the file from the sender
scan, and action as appropriate.

Jabber Server Admins, there world obviously doesn't change much if at all.
Clients will go direct no more traffic than normal.

Client Developers, they would be happy (I'm sure) because their products
will work together (without crashing each other), if the 'standard' is not
ambiguous or open to interpretation.

End users, they would surely get a system that is reliable, the lack of
needing to worry what client their friend is using before sending or
receiving some data. For corporate users, they would not be allowed to step
outside the company policy (which could get them in trouble anyway). For
home users, especially those behind NAT routers, they also benefit from the
agreed ports, because it makes it very easy for them to have the
file-sharing.

How about this?

Subject: RE: [JDEV] File transfers


I don't understand the arbitrary port comment... They are arbitrary.
Marshall and others picked em, and that was that.  When I hit the send
button in my email client (Outlook) it connects to exchange on some god
awful port with some god awful protocol that is most definitely not 110 and
is most definitely not SMTP (SMTP is 25 by the way, not 110).  Now there's a
connector that plugs into exchange and sends my message out to the
appropriate SMTP server via port 25, but that has nothing to do with POP
unless the other end HAPPENS to be using POP as the mailbox access
mechanism.  That POP server on the other end in some ways acts as a client
to the SMTP server, although not via networked protocols but via file system
semantics or whatever the particular package has decided the right way to
communicate between components is (e.g. on Win2k simple SMTP server, I would
just look in the mailroot\Mailbox directory, or use the CDO &quot;client&quot; objects
to access the mail store from a POP server I could write).

POP, HTTP, SMTP and most modern protocols are really nothing special.  I
could implement a POP &quot;server&quot; on my &quot;client machine&quot; pretty damn easily,
and could pretty much reuse the same code for an HTTP &quot;server&quot; on my client.
This would blur the lines in the case where, for example, I wrote a local
POP proxy.  From the point of view of Outlook Express, my POP proxy is the
server, but from the distant POP server it is the client. The fact that all
of these protocols are text based, fixed command set protocols blurs the
importance of clients and servers because of exactly what you say, that a
client asks and a server answers.  This is not a component-wide or &quot;process&quot;
wide distinction necessarily, it is a REQUEST wide decision, and any or all
components can make requests of each other.  This is why it is generally a
good idea to implement file transfer by having the client act like an HTTP
&quot;server&quot;.  #1, it's easy, and #2, if it really IS a full blown web server
(i.e. for a firewall workaround) everything still works just the same.

This is all turning into a conceptual argument, and clearly you're not going
for the analogy/metaphor, which is fine.  I can't speak for Mike, but I
certainly don't need any lessons in Internet protocols, I've been here since
there weren't any.  In one paragraph I think you're saying you want to make
client-server into peer-to-peer/client-client.  If I'm understanding you
right, I totally agree.  And what I understand that to mean is that these
labels of distinction really aren't relevant.  So the question comes down to
what components are well suited to doing what tasks.  The Jabber server is
not well suited architecturally to act as a byte repeater for client
non-messaging data transfer.  I'm not sure I'd want to do anything to
encourage this just so some client developer can be lazy about implementing
things the right way.  (Not to mention that this is actually complex to
implement in ADDITION to a proper file transfer mechanism, and in the end
costs our poor client developers more time, not less)

I trust the maturity and experience of the members of this list to be able
to understand conceptual discussions of this nature, this isn't developer
school.  The original discussion was about whether the Jabber &quot;server&quot;
should be used to shuttle packets on behalf of clients and whether that
should be part of the protocol, at this point I'm confused reading your mail
whether you advocate this or don't.  I'll be clear, I do not advocate
creating protocol elements to allow the concept of a &quot;file&quot; to be routed,
split, encoded, and reassembled by Jabber servers.  I advocate a mechanism
for negotiating protocol based multi-party &quot;connections&quot; (i.e. clients
providing endpoints) for things like file transfer, video conferencing,
networked full-motion-video Parcheesi, and whatever the heck else the
developer community thinks up.  Whatever mechanism is used should not use
the words &quot;file transfer&quot; in anything but string literals in my opinion.
