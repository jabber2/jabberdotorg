<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; An alternative, would be to create a simple(-ish) PASS type
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; component that would run as a service under WinNT/2000/XP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or under Linux, and make it very simple for consumers to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; install.  When they install a client behind ICS or other NAT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; box, you could make it very clear to them that they need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; install this PASS component on the gateway machine that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has the private IP address, or their files/voicechat/webcam
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc will not work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course this isn't going to help the people that use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware NAT boxes, but they will have to wait for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UPnP I guess.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thats good I like this local PASS component idea, this would
</I>&gt;<i> mean not just file transfers, but other oob data like voice and
</I>&gt;<i> whiteboard etc could be done, all you have to do it is in the
</I>&gt;<i> client tell it where the PASS server is, and the client connects
</I>&gt;<i> to the PASS kind of like a server but with little or no
</I>&gt;<i> authentication to a local port that cannot be accessed from
</I>&gt;<i> outside on the internet (to prevent hackers etc on the internet
</I>&gt;<i> taking advantage of it) to tell it to setup ports like PASS for
</I>&gt;<i> any purpose the client might need.
</I>
The problem is however, with the current PASS JEP:

<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0003.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0003.html</A>

The PASS server has to be able to understand and reply to Jabber XML
packets.  This is probably too complicated for a simple PASS type service
that you are running on your home machine.  A simpler way for the client to
negotiate with the &quot;PASS&quot; server would have to be found I guess...

Michael.
