<PRE>Ok adding value, you simply don't know what you are talking about.

How's that?  POP AND IMAP are protocols for Clients to talk to Servers to 
access stores of messages and attachments.  A Pop or IMAP Client DOES NOT 
talk to another Pop or IMAP Client...EVER...SMTP is the way you SEND 
messages to those stores and every single email message you send is 
transferred using SMTP and BTW SendMail is just an SMTP Program for sending 
mail, it has nothing to do with &quot;bulk&quot;.  Have you ever setup an email 
client?  If you did you had to setup the email server for getting your 
email and choose POP3 or IMAP4 and then an SMTP server for outgoing, or if 
you leave that blank it tries to use the same server you setup for 
incoming.  But these are on different ports even if on the same ip 
address/dns name.

If YOU want to add value, don't spout about things you obviously know 
NOTHING about.  Read the specifications about POP3, IMAP4 AND SMTP and you 
can find those at <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org">http://www.ietf.org</A>

I completely agree it depends on where you are standing and you are 
standing in the dark.
