<PRE>I've tracked down where the problem was occurring and I can
fix it. Not sure though why it was occurring and if I should
fix it as I have.

When a new user registered they were added to the sql db but
no entry was added to the users0k table and the server
crashed. When the server was restarted the user still didn't
have a 0k entry so couldn't log on, but logging on as an
existing user added a 0k entry for the newly registered
user. The server was falling over at mod_auth_0k line 217.
To see what would happen I commented out lines 215 - 217

//    /* if the password is to be changed, just remove the
old 0k auth vars, they'll get reset on next auth get */
//    if(xmlnode_get_tag_data(m-&gt;packet-&gt;iq,&quot;password&quot;) !=
NULL)
//        xdb_set(m-&gt;si-&gt;xc, id, NS_AUTH_0K, NULL);

and I was able to register new users and log them in without
server crashes. 0k entries get added into the sql db
immediately on registration. The code I commented out says
it's for changing passwords but I tried changing some after
the comment out and was able to.

Anyone know what's going on?
