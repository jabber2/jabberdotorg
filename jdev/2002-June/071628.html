Okay. I just wondered why no one from jabber.com commented on the security
issues and/or pointed out how jabber.com intends to act concerning these
issues.

The whole point is that wide-spread implementations of this protocol
should be avoided but without discussion this will be a fait accompli.

&gt;<i> 3) Same as 2, but add some big bold letters that say &quot;THIS PROTOCOL IS

I agree.

I think we should try to set up some standards track JEP quickly. Perhaps
you can refer to that JEP then in JEP-0025 or simply withdraw it.
See discussion in standards-jig.

&gt;<i> I'd like to see more people document protocols that they are using as

Of course.

&gt;<i> to at least seed the discussion of what ought to be a standard.
</I>
Well, discussion has to take place then. I got no real response when
contacting you even by mail (no offense).

&gt;<i> As I've said to a couple of people, I think that HTTP polling is a security
</I>&gt;<i> nightmare, no matter how it's implemented.
</I>
Well now it's a nightmare for both user and firewall admin. With a proper
protocol it's only a nightmare for the firewall admin ;-).

&gt;<i> I believe that if you do your polling over HTTPS, none of the stated attacks
</I>&gt;<i> are possible, as far as I know.
</I>
Of course. Polling over HTTPS is both a bandwith and processing power
nightmare for the server though - as you said.
