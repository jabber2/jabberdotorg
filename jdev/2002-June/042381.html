<PRE>---------- Original Message ----------

&gt;<i>I'm not even trying to do file transfers, just trying to keep the Jabber
</I>&gt;<i>protocols and architecture clean and functional.  I have no horse in this
</I>&gt;<i>race. :)
</I>
Would clean mean a standard for inband data transfer rather then everyone 
implementing their own inband data transfer? Would functional mean that it is 
interoperatable with p2p datatransfers? I think so but everyone has the right to 
disagree with me ofcourse.. I'll look into SOAP over Jabber..

It seems there is no real intrest for this on the list though, most are Desktop Instant 
Messenger oriented perhaps? 
Or just too busy with others things to mix themselves in this lengthy partially offtopic 
discussion (that must be it), so this will be the last of it then...

&gt;<i>Just to clarify, many ISPs, including us, *do not pay* (directly) for bytes
</I>&gt;<i>between a dialup customer and &quot;the Internet&quot;, but DO pay for bytes between
</I>&gt;<i>their servers and &quot;the Internet&quot;.  Therefore, inband data transmission will
</I>&gt;<i>cost $$$ in the latter case, but not in the former.
</I>
This.. well if you say so I believe you :) I assume this is American market? In the 
Netherlands most dailup ISPs make their profit by receiving kickback for every minute 
someone is connected by the telco's. If on top of that their data traffic is free then why 
are they all collapsing? Or does this simply mean your ISP outsources Dailup acces 
alltogether and just supplies the services like email, webhosting, support, etc. ?
Just wondering (I don't think a reply belongs on the list though, email perhaps?)...
