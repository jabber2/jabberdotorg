<PRE>I have actually used both libs to a very indepth degree. JabminRPC in 
its short lived life has been written in J::C and then rewritten in N::J.

J::C is really nice for things other than jabber since it depends 
strongly upon XML::Parser, and that allows you to basically parse things 
other than jabber packets (like the jabber.xml config file) in an xpath 
like way.

I also really like N::J for those really high level abstractions. I 
wrote a simple webpresence bot using N::J and the part that took the 
longest was talking via DBI and DBD::ODBC to MySQL. I had the jabber 
connection up and running in under 2 minutes.

But alas both have flaws too. After while you get tired of 
typing/cutting/pasting, all of those methods with J::C to accomplish the 
simple things that N::J does in one method. As for N::J Everything is an 
object and you only get objects back, and that can be cumbersome with 
things that are not fully implemented, such as XDB(understandable since 
its not written into a JEP or anything anywhere. No official means no 
support), that you could easily just get a jabber node and parse it out 
via J::C.

The only major problem right now with _both_ libs, is the complete lack 
of asynchronous parsing. This means the major bottleneck in your perl 
apps is the parser and you must wait in the queue to get parsed. Part of 
that issue falls upon perl's inability to be properly threaded. And this 
in turn leads people to write parsers that are explicitly blocking 
because of the serialization.

But overall, I love the work and love that goes into these libs. It 
enables anyone to jump into jabber programming and to add jabber 
abilities to just about anything that has a perl interface.

</I>&gt;<i> GetFrom(), it allows you to build your own (the equivalent here is 
</I>&gt;<i> attr('from')) using the NodeFactory module which was loosely aimed to
</I>&gt;<i> reflect the API of the xmlnode library in the open source Jabber server.
</I>&gt;<i> It gives you the flexibility to manipulate the nodes of the Jabber XML
