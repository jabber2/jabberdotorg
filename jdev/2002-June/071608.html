<PRE>He knows what he's talking about, he's just assuming too much in his
descriptions.  People who don't know what they're talking about don't use
words like MTA and MUA, and if they do they act very proud of knowing it. :)
 
Hard distinctions between client and server are SOOO last century. :)  From
a conceptual perspective, a *local* POP server (i.e. mycompany.com) is in
some ways a client for the overall server &quot;cloud&quot; of Internet mail.  SMTP is
essentially a non-realtime store and forward network, which is &quot;batch&quot; in
many ways, for lots of good reasons.
 
And those points of view are part of the reason we both think that putting
this special &quot;realtime non-messaging packet forwarder&quot; hat on the Jabber
server is a stretch, and has all the problems we've previously mentioned.

Ok adding value, you simply don't know what you are talking about.

How's that?  POP AND IMAP are protocols for Clients to talk to Servers to
access stores of messages and attachments.  A Pop or IMAP Client DOES NOT
talk to another Pop or IMAP Client...EVER...SMTP is the way you SEND
messages to those stores and every single email message you send is
transferred using SMTP and BTW SendMail is just an SMTP Program for sending
mail, it has nothing to do with &quot;bulk&quot;.  Have you ever setup an email
client?  If you did you had to setup the email server for getting your email
and choose POP3 or IMAP4 and then an SMTP server for outgoing, or if you
leave that blank it tries to use the same server you setup for incoming.
But these are on different ports even if on the same ip address/dns name.

If YOU want to add value, don't spout about things you obviously know
NOTHING about.  Read the specifications about POP3, IMAP4 AND SMTP and you
can find those at <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org">http://www.ietf.org</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org/</A>&gt; 

I completely agree it depends on where you are standing and you are standing
in the dark.

There's a great way to add value to a thread. :) 

&gt;<i> POP, IMAP and MAPI (Exchange) ARE NOT &quot;client-to-client&quot;, PLEASE! 
</I>
Sure, why not?  user --&gt; sendmail --&gt; mail spool accessible via POP, 
at which point the server stops being so much of a server and starts 
acting a little more like a peer (POP, IMAP and MAPI being ad hoc, 
connected, conversational programs, unlike SMTP, which is largely a 
batch-oriented bulk drop).  It all depends where you're standing. 
No need to question my mudball of origin. 

&gt;<i> sendmail is just an SMTP mail transfer agent program and no different than

&gt;<i> any other SMTP mail transfer agent program like those from Netscape and 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft...ARG! 
</I>
Netscape makes an MTA?  What's it called?  I've seen their MUA, but 
I'm surprised to hear they have an MTA.  I bet it crashes a lot. :)
