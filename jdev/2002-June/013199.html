<PRE>&gt;<i>Quit your license whining. 
</I>Fine, I wont bother you anymore with it.
I just was looking for some XMLRPC over Jabber or over SMTP stuff and
found his code days ago and had written to him about the license. 

Later on after reading the outdated docs and fighting to get cvs
access, I figured out how to get cvs and downloaded the repository to
scan for XMLRPC code. I found his code again.

You can leave in on CVS if you want,
 but it is not fair to the users to obligate them to delete it if they
download the code by accident (like me).

I support alternative licenses and think that Ransom is a good idea,
but just not in this context, it only confuses people and causes bad
feelings, at least I *WOULD* feel guilty stealing snippets from you,
and alot of my perl code is written from snippets from other peoples
code who I give fair mention to. 

&gt;<i>It's not like Adam (or I for that
</I>&gt;<i> matter, the author of that code) have any money to sue you if you 
</I>&gt;<i> decided to write your own jabber&lt;-&gt;smtp transport in perl. 
</I>And I am not going to do that,
I want to use XMLRPC over jabber or smtp, 
I mean it would be nice to use SMTP for the queuing of the messages as
well, but the server can do that.

&gt;<i>So lay off.
</I>You creativity is applaudable, so bravo. 
I wont complain any more about the Ransom licenses.
