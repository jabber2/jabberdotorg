<PRE>Hi, all. Sorry, I don't often pay attention to the list on a daily 
basis, so this thread slipped me by until James CC'ed it to me. I'd also 
like to apologize for not replying to any previous emails about the 
issue. I get way too many emails a day, and am experimenting with ways 
to solve that problem. As it is, some messages to slip past me or 
accidentilly find their way into the trash along with the 70+ spams I 
get a day.

First of all, Ransom [<A HREF="http://www.theoretic.com/?Ransom]">http://www.theoretic.com/?Ransom]</A> is a model I'd 
like to develop into a mature option for other software developers. It 
certainly isn't perfect, but I see great potential in it. I'm using 
JabberSMTP (the Perl SMTP Transport on my website) 
[<A HREF="http://www.theoretic.com/?JabberSMTP]">http://www.theoretic.com/?JabberSMTP]</A> as an experiment to try and flesh 
it out. Unfortunately I have not had the time to really dedicate myself 
to it like I've wanted, and alot of inconsistencies do exist as a result 
of that.

I understand JabberSMTP still needs alot of work, and I frankly don't 
care about the $100 I'm trying to get from it. I just care about 
developing the Ransom model. If I don't get the $100, nothing will 
change. I will never try and stop people's use of the code, and there is 
not a 30 day period like shareware. Think of Ransom as &quot;freeware (as in 
cost) that *will* become free/open software (as in liberty), just not 
right now&quot;.

JabberSMTP is not GPL *yet*, although it will someday (at the lastest, 
end of December 2002, although possibly earlier as part of the Ransom 
license). This has no bearing on Jabber or the other implimentations of 
it. Jabber is an open protocol, not any set of code. It is like email 
and HTTP in that respect. Anyone can make code using the Jabber protocol 
under any license, and they can all communicate to each other over the 
Jabber open protocol. Because JabberSMTP is not GPL or free software yet 
does not in any way &quot;taint&quot; the rest of Jabber.

I will be ahppy to answer any questions, and use them to improve 
JabberSMTP and Ransom, even if it means accepting I was wrong in the 
past in some way. I am already beginning to fix the problems you list 
below, getting off my ass finally to dedicate time and attention to 
them. I'll keep you updated if you want.

Perhaps here is a problem with JabberSMTP being on JabberStudio. I have 
not thought so until now, but if it is decided Jabberstudio is only for 
free software (as in liberty) and open source projects, I will certainly 
remove it from there, since it is not yet those things (but will be soon).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Also , how can I contribute to jabber if we are not all playing on the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Also, adam has been pushing to get jabber into DotGNU, 
</I>&gt;<i>project and I have not wanted to make a big deal about it, but
</I>&gt;<i>jabber is now an officially endorsed project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But it is strange that I cannot even use his contribution as part of a
</I>&gt;<i>GNU software,
</I>&gt;<i>the license is totally unacceptable for a free software project and
</I>&gt;<i>represents an inpurity that has to be removed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Dont take me as being negative,

</I>&gt;<i>he likes, but not mixing it up with free software. I dont want anything

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you feel that this is good, then collect the money,
