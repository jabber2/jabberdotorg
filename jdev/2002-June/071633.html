<PRE>Mike angrily flames:
&gt;<i> How's that?  POP AND IMAP are protocols for Clients to talk to
</I>&gt;<i> Servers to access stores of messages and attachments.  A Pop or
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP Client DOES NOT talk to another Pop or IMAP Client...EVER...
</I>&gt;<i> SMTP is the way you SEND messages to those stores and every single
</I>&gt;<i> email message you send is transferred using SMTP and BTW SendMail
</I>&gt;<i> is just an SMTP Program for sending mail, it has nothing to do
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;bulk&quot;.
</I>
Oh dear, I appear to have killed your cat or something with my
message.  I apologize.

The distinction I was making -- apparently not well enough for you
to understand -- was that in SMTP, there is usually minimal conversation;
the conversation is, in 99% of cases, the same between the two partners,
and the task is a batch-like, bulk task usually involving one transaction.

By comparison, POP/IMAP are chatty, and they tend to stay connected for
multiple
discrete 'transactions'.  This is more 'peer'-like behavior, a la Jabber,
etc.
There isn't a hard-and-fast definition of what a server is and what a client
is
any more; more and more we're talking shades of grey.  Certainly it's
nothing to
get screamy about.

&gt;<i> Have you ever setup an email client?  
</I>
I think so.  Over the course of my 17 year career as a Unix hacker, I've
also written about 20 sendmail.cf files, most from scratch (starting with
a UUCP feed), as well as written about a million lines of Perl, including
the first opcode-based safe remote execution protocol in any language
anywhere.  Somewhere in there may have been a few e-mail clients on
desktops.

&gt;<i> If you did you had to setup the email server for getting your email
</I>&gt;<i> and choose POP3 or IMAP4 and then an SMTP server for outgoing,
</I>
Well, maybe on Windows.  I distinctly remember not having to do that
on Xenix, SCO Unix, Unixware, Irix, HP/UX, Domain/OS, RSTS/E, VMS,
Digital Unix, Linux .96c, QNX, VxWorks, *BSD, BSDI, Netware, or
PalmOS.  For that matter, I didn't have to do that on Windows, either.

&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> if you leave that blank it tries to use the same server you setup
</I>&gt;<i> for incoming.
</I>
Not all the world is Outlook Express.

&gt;<i> If YOU want to add value, don't spout about things you obviously know
</I>&gt;<i> NOTHING about.  Read the specifications about POP3, IMAP4 AND SMTP and
</I>&gt;<i> you can find those at <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org">http://www.ietf.org</A>
</I>
Thanks for the pointer.  So what exactly is Netscape's MTA again?

&gt;<i> I completely agree it depends on where you are standing and you are
</I>standing in the dark. 

It happens to the best of us.  Good luck with AppsAsPeers.com; if you need
any pointers, I have some work I did in 1996 which could be relevant.
