<PRE>Jabber::Connection vs Net::Jabber is a matter of taste.  It depends
whether you want a style and construct forced upon you for doing node
manipulation or not.  J::C allows you to do what you want - including
getting into trouble ( very Perlish if you ask me ), where as N::J tries
to express the Jabber Protocol in Perl, and therefore must enforce the
rules of it.

Personally I prefer to a more free flowing format - but as I said it is
a matter of taste ( J::C was invaluable for prototype work for pubsub
JEP24 - which is after all defining new protocols ).

As for having to repeat code again and again, perhaps that is a style
issue too.  Explore Larry Walls programming characteristic of Laziness.

Also, as far as threading goes Perl 5.8 is almost upone us ( RC1 has
just been released ), with a completely new threading model - it will be
very interesting to see what that brings.

Cheers.

</I>&gt;<i> other than jabber packets (like the jabber.xml config file) in an xpath 
</I>&gt;<i> like way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also really like N::J for those really high level abstractions. I

</I>&gt;<i> connection up and running in under 2 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But alas both have flaws too. After while you get tired of 
</I>&gt;<i> typing/cutting/pasting, all of those methods with J::C to accomplish the 
</I>&gt;<i> simple things that N::J does in one method. As for N::J Everything is an 
</I>&gt;<i> object and you only get objects back, and that can be cumbersome with 
</I>&gt;<i> things that are not fully implemented, such as XDB(understandable since 
</I>&gt;<i> its not written into a JEP or anything anywhere. No official means no 
</I>&gt;<i> support), that you could easily just get a jabber node and parse it out 
</I>&gt;<i> via J::C.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only major problem right now with _both_ libs, is the complete lack 
</I>&gt;<i> of asynchronous parsing. This means the major bottleneck in your perl 
</I>&gt;<i> apps is the parser and you must wait in the queue to get parsed. Part of 
</I>&gt;<i> that issue falls upon perl's inability to be properly threaded. And this 
</I>&gt;<i> in turn leads people to write parsers that are explicitly blocking 
</I>&gt;<i> because of the serialization.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But overall, I love the work and love that goes into these libs. It 
</I>&gt;<i> enables anyone to jump into jabber programming and to add jabber 
</I>&gt;<i> abilities to just about anything that has a perl interface.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Jabber::Connection is the odd man out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; J::C's process() uses IO::Select (specifically the can_read() function).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The behaviour is the same - it blocks for up to X seconds waiting for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something to be available. Calling process() (i.e. with no explicit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; value) just makes the function assume 0 seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;As for the differences between the two.  DJ wrote Jabber::XXXXXX as an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;exercise and is slowly adding more to it.  Net::Jabber is meant to be a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;100% protocol compatible and high level implementation (in other words 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;GetFrom() is high level as it hides the guts from you).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It did start out as an excercise but turned out to be the module I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking for too ;-) It's different to N::J in that it's a lowlevel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lightweight approach. Rather than include high-level functions like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GetFrom(), it allows you to build your own (the equivalent here is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attr('from')) using the NodeFactory module which was loosely aimed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reflect the API of the xmlnode library in the open source Jabber server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It gives you the flexibility to manipulate the nodes of the Jabber XML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol as you see fit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The examples you see on some of my web pages are with N::J as that was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what I was using at the time. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Although I've seen examples of people using both J::C and N::J together,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's usually the case that people will find one or the other that they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feel comfortable with (bottom-up vs top-down approaches).
