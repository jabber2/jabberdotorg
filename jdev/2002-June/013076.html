:<i>-)))) Maybe we should chat over jabber, but transfer our files using 
</I>a file sharing application, using the applications exactly for the 
purpose they were originally created for??? And optimized (hopefully)?

It looks a bit strange to me to use Jabber at all for file transfers. 
I'm reading that book &quot;Peer-to-Peer&quot; (O'Reilly) at the moment and 
also &quot;Programming Jabber&quot;. My first impression is that though Jabber 
is much more than an IM client/server, it nevertheless provides and 
was made for IM-like functionality, which could be used - of course - 
by any application which needs that. Maybe sitting on top of a 
peer-to-peer app, creating another address space, bringing in the 
notion of &quot;presence&quot;, *coordinate* file transfers (in comparison to 
doing them) and the like.

When I think of &quot;messaging&quot;, then I'm thinking of something 
lightweight almost immediately, but not of transferring huge files. I 
wouldn't call that &quot;Instant Messaging&quot; or &quot;Messaging&quot; any longer, but 
file sharing/file distribution. I have to admit though that the 
distinction is getting blurred the smaller the files become. A JPG 
might be smaller than a text I'm pasting into a message window ...

&gt;<i> That's probably better, but the gestalt of the discussion at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment seems to be &quot;server-assisted transfers are stupid,&quot; which is
</I>&gt;<i> why I posted in favor of server intermediation.
</I>
As I said in my new posting again: IMHO, that depends on the 
situation and the rules to decide that aren't easy to set up. 

Without real tests and numbers, we're lost, I fear.

Have a nice day,
Marco
