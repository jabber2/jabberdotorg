<PRE>Why doesn't pth-1.4.0 compile under cygwin?
Just finished a full cygwin install, tried to make pth and fails out with
the same error and warnings as usual.

Anybody know what's going on?

I've also tried downloading 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 from pth's site and building it
independently but it's still a no go.
