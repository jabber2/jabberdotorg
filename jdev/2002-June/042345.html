<PRE>Joe, while I respect your collected response to my over-aggressive
criticism, I am being over-aggressive for a reason.

I understand that HTTP polling is still a developing concept and there have
been bumps along the road. I'll agree that a standards track should be
pursued, and I'll go along with your option #3 below. I hope that puts
JEP-0025 to rest.

What I find impossible to overlook is that Jabber, Inc. is publishing
software with known and fairly severe security deficiencies. It's up there
on a polished web site, with a cool-looking diagram, white papers and price
tags ($25,000 if I'm not mistaken) to go with it. Granted none of this
claims the client is secure, but neither does it provide any sort of
warning that it is not a good idea to use this for sensitive purposes.

I understand this is Jabber, Inc.'s business decision. But I believe it is
an irresponsible business decision. In 2002, a hole of this magnitude in
any moderately deployed software should be fixed within days or hours -
even Microsoft is getting OK at this. Letting security fixes come through
in the next &quot;release cycle&quot; is _so_ last decade. :-)

Anyway, I hope you can take this as the one nugget of constructive
criticism in all my ranting. Jabber, Inc. should get in the habit of
pushing security fixes out quickly, because it will absolutely need to do
so if and when Jabber gets really big. As you are concerned about the
precedent of suppressing a JEP, I am concerned about the precedent of
letting Jabber, Inc. become associated with insecure software.

-Mike

OK, as one of the authors of the JEP in question, I do have the
responsibility so say this at least one more time, I suppose.  I may not
have done it on the jdev list, but I thought I'd gotten the gist across in
foundation meetings.

I realize that there are security holes in JEP-0025.  I'm not convinced
that
any of the solutions that have been proposed are the &quot;right&quot; solution.  I
think we need to have a discussion about it.  I think the way to do that is
to have a new, standards-track JEP.  Yes, it would be nice if I could get
around to doing that, but I've been fairly swamped.  If someone else could
take a crack at a strawman, it would be helpful.

Next, there *is no way* for me to modify our current product in the
timeframes involved, due to our existing release cycle.  Once we have a
standards-track JEP approved, we'll see if we can support it in a future
version.  Because of this, it makes no sense to modify JEP-0025 to add any
security measures.

So, the foundation needs to choose one of these:

1) I can withdraw the JEP, in which case there will be no public
documentation of the polling protocol.  That doesn't seem neighborly to me,
but I'm willing to bow to overwhelming pressure.  Remember, it's
INFORMATIONAL, which means that it documents an existing protocol.

2) Leave it as is.  The council can decide whether or not to approve it.
For informational JEPs, I think the criterion should be &quot;does this JEP
accurately portray the existing protocol.&quot;  If the council decides that the
criteria should include &quot;... and we like it,&quot; then the council should
reject
it.  If that happens, I don't know if it should stay on the JEP list or
not.
That's a process question.

3) Same as 2, but add some big bold letters that say &quot;THIS PROTOCOL IS
INSECURE.  ITS USE IS DISCOURAGED.&quot;  Frankly, I'm fine with that.

I'd like to see more people document protocols that they are using as
informational, to at least seed the discussion of what ought to be a
standard.  I'm concerned about the potential precedent of discouraging that
behavior.


&lt;rant direction=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;
As I've said to a couple of people, I think that HTTP polling is a security
nightmare, no matter how it's implemented.  I've basically enabled people
to
thwart their firewall administrators.  Yes, it's useful for those
situations
where the firewall is administrated by people that don't believe that the
Internet can be used for legitimate business purposes, so we have to have
it
in our product mix.  But its use should be discouraged where possible.
&lt;/rant&gt;

&lt;note relevance=&quot;low&quot;&gt;
I believe that if you do your polling over HTTPS, none of the stated
attacks
are possible, as far as I know.  There are still some cool traffic analysis
attacks, but no more so that with any Jabber session.  If you have enough
hardware to do HTTPS polling for a large number of users, well... wow.
That's impressive, I'm sure.
&lt;/note&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> I agree, unfortunately, we now have a new implementation based on this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;informational&quot; JEP which is vulnerable to the same security problems. So
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> propose that the informational vs. standards track distinction is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> meaningless. Look at Matthias' comments - he used it for lack of anything
</I>&gt;<i> better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The authors of this JEP, in my opinion, have the responsibility of fixing
</I>&gt;<i> it. We have handed them several ways to do so. Jabber, Inc., in my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion,
</I>&gt;<i> has the responsibility of fixing its web client before its users using it
</I>&gt;<i> for &quot;financial applications&quot; get burned.

</I>&gt;<i> Mike -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree, and I strongly recommend against the use of JEP-0025 as-is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for any remotely sensitive purposes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have been aware of the security problems for two months and have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposed multiple viable solutions, but nothing has been fixed. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JEP either needs to be fixed or withdrawn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *disclaimer: I am employed by Jabber, Inc* :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> JEP-25 is INFORMATIONAL! It won't be withdrawn as it's not standards
</I>&gt;<i> track.
</I>&gt;<i> The whole idea behind informational JEPS is that they allow companies
</I>&gt;<i> (like
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber, Inc.) to document the protocol extensions that they build, so
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> people in the jabber community can use and build other products to them
</I>&gt;<i> (if
</I>&gt;<i> they so desire). It's unlikely that this JEP will change since it
</I>reflects
&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> currently deployed product (good bad or ugly :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Someone needs to take JEP-25 as a base, and create a new STANDARDS track
</I>&gt;<i> JEP
</I>&gt;<i> that fixes the security holes in the current implementation and submit
</I>it.
&gt;<i> Then client authors (like myself) can choose to implement either JEP-25,
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> new standards JEP, or both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
