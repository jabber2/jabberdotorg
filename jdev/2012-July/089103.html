<PRE>Hello,

Is there a way generally in XMPP to send a message to an unsubscribed
address? Meaning, the sender has not sent an authorization request to the
recipient thus far. In other words, I have a situation where I would like a
service to be able to send simple messages to a set of users. This is over
S2S, so the sender would not be any kind of admin on the recipient's domain
or anything like that. I realize that the recipient's user agent (in the
particular case, the recipients will be on Google Apps) may require them to
accept some kind of prompt.

Alternately, is there a way to kind of package an authorization request and
a message together, so that as soon as the recipient accepts the sender's
contact request they will immediately see the message the sender was trying
to send? Or is the only way for the sender to somehow queue the message
locally on the client end and only send it when the presence subscribe
request has been accepted?

My issue here is that the sender is actually an agent and I don't care
about having the recipients on the roster or tracking their presence or
anything like that; I just want to be able to send messages.

What's the right way to handle this?
