Hi Aaron, I took another look at your original message in this thread:

<A HREF="https://www.jabber.org/jdev/2010-March/088174.html">https://www.jabber.org/jdev/2010-March/088174.html</A>

and:

<A HREF="https://www.jabber.org/jdev/2009-November/087885.html">https://www.jabber.org/jdev/2009-November/087885.html</A>

We had some discussions about a related issue recently on the XMPP WG list:

<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/xmpp/current/msg00332.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/xmpp/current/msg00332.html</A>

The conclusion we came to is that the authentication identity is indeed
not necessarily the same as the localpart of a JID. We mostly glossed
over this issue in RFC 3920, but the replacement RFC will make it clear
that this is a matter for the SASL mechanism or local deployment policy,
not the core XMPP RFC.

&gt;<i> If it's true that the RFC discourages this practice, then I think the
</I>&gt;<i> RFC may need to be revised.  For people who are running simple
</I>&gt;<i> stand-alone Jabber servers, this sort of thing doesn't matter.  But for
</I>&gt;<i> organizations like mine that are trying to embrace XMPP by adding an
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP interface to existing infrastructure, this is a major issue.  GTalk
</I>&gt;<i> has a variation of the same problem, except with domain instead of
</I>&gt;<i> username.  I think the real long-term solution here is that the RFC
</I>&gt;<i> needs to firmly instruct clients to not make assumptions about their
</I>&gt;<i> JIDs, 
</I>
See <A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-xmpp-3920bis-05">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-xmpp-3920bis-05</A> (section 7.2.7).

&gt;<i> and instead accept (or reject) what they are given at resource
</I>&gt;<i> binding.
</I>
We could probably strengthen the text about that.

&gt;&gt;<i> You
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are, again, in violation of the spec by delivering stanzas where the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bare jid does not match their bound name, and you could cause
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unintended consequences on the client (crashes or strange behavior) by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply pinging them in this way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't find any prohibition like this in RFC 3920 or the draft.  Can
</I>&gt;<i> you point out a specific passage that prohibits this sort of probing?
</I>
I don't see any need for this -- the client needs to get its JID from
the server.

&gt;&gt;<i> I really don't see either of these options being viable as the client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is simply broken if it doesn't respond to it's bound fulljid and you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> risk greater consequences if you try to &quot;adjust&quot; at the protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> level.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My main goal is for a short-term, practical improvement in functionality
</I>&gt;<i> for as many users as possible.
</I>
I agree with Fritzy here -- better to file bug reports or provide
patches to the clients you care about. Supposedly short-term fixes have
a way of lasting for a long time, people start to depend on the fix and
it will never disappear.

&gt;<i> As an alternative, I'm thinking about perhaps having the user do
</I>&gt;<i> something special to indicate that 'JID masquerading' should be
</I>&gt;<i> performed, such as placing a special character in their username.
</I>
Please not.

&gt;<i> Another option is to try to detect specific versions that are broken
</I>&gt;<i> using XEP-0092: Software Version, and apply the workaround for just
</I>&gt;<i> those.  This would get correct operations to the largest groups of
</I>&gt;<i> users, and prevent breaking people whose clients were in fact operating
</I>&gt;<i> correctly.
</I>
Do you have a list of broken clients? Let's figure out what they are and
start the process of reporting bugs and fixing code.

Peter
