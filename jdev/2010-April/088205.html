<PRE>And Aaron Kryptokos spoke on 03/31/2010 02:50 AM, saying:
&gt;<i> Basically, our user instructions for broken clients is to log using
</I>&gt;<i> their authentication username as the node in their JID, which is the
</I>&gt;<i> only way to make many popular clients (such as Pidgin) work.  The
</I>&gt;<i> problem we encounter is that most of these clients will operate in a
</I>&gt;<i> reduced-functionality mode, because the client is unable to recognize
</I>&gt;<i> stanzas that are directed to them if they have a 'to' attribute.
</I>
Pidgin does indeed not have the ability to differentiate authcid and
authzid (although I'm considering adding it based on the recent discussions
in the XMPP WG).  However, see below.

&gt;<i> One way to work around these clients is to perform translation on the
</I>&gt;<i> 'to' attribute to whatever the client thinks its JID is.  The problem
</I>&gt;<i> with this is the client never actually tells the server what it thinks
</I>&gt;<i> its JID is.  Ideally, clients would always assume the JID that the
</I>&gt;<i> server provides in resource binding, but in practice, most do not do
</I>&gt;<i> this correctly.
</I>
Are you actually experiencing Pidgin/Finch/Adium/libpurple operating in
&quot;reduced functionality mode&quot;?   I'm absolutely sure that all recent
versions (and as far back as 2.2.0, which is where I got tired of checking)
of libpurple /do/ pick up their full JID from the &lt;bind/&gt; response (and
AFAIK, this works correctly, because it's used for Google Talk with
gmail.com|googlemail.com).

If you are experiencing issues with Pidgin in this environment, could you
explicate?  What features don't work when the usernames don't match?

Thanks,
~Paul
