</I>&gt;<i> I am frankly shocked that you described XMPP as unable (unwilling!) to forward messages in a C2S2S2C scenario.  XMPP, the Definitive guide on page 13 of the architecture describes that exact scenario calling in a direct federation model versus email&#8217;s indirect federation model.  Is that a bad book to use a reference?

I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say. An XMPP server will absolutely forward a message it has received from another domain to one of it's own clients, assuming that the server the message came from is authoritative for the domain in the 'from' field of the stanza. However, XMPP servers will not forward a stanza to a domain unless the destination server is authoritative for the domain in the 'to' field. And, likewise, a server will not accept a stanza from a server that is not authoritative for the domain in the 'from' field. This is in contrast to SMTP, where you can have a forward-facing SMTP buffer server that would queue and resend email to the real internal SMTP server. I thought you were trying to do the equivalent in XMPP, which I see is not what you meant. My confusion.

&gt;<i> I suppose since we are indeed rolling our own we could conceivably allow a C2S2S2C scenario, right?  We are building this using .Net/C# language. 
</I>
If you are rolling your own, you can do whatever you want. I was thinking about things from a &quot;IT department&quot; perspective, trying to make this work using already existing XMPP servers. 

&gt;<i> The scenario we are looking at not a standard chat client.  Mostly passing SOAP messages around.
</I>

Now I'm curious. Mind if I ask what you are planning to deploy? (If you can't say, that's fine)
