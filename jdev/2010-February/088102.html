There's certainly a problem with DIGEST-MD5. Hopefully we can leave it
behind and settle on SCRAM going forward.

&gt;<i> I propose that we start a small project to act as an aggregator for
</I>&gt;<i> existing open source implementations which could be used as references.
</I>
That's a great idea.

&gt;<i> Once we have that going, an implementation selected for its readability
</I>&gt;<i> could become the (official?) reference implementation.
</I>
We've never had reference implementations. I'm not even quite sure what
&quot;reference implementation&quot; means. :)

One approach would be to write an implementation in C and then write
wrappers for that implemenation in Python, Lua, etc. This seems to be a
popular approach for things like security (OpenSSL) and i18n (libidn),
and might make sense for things like caps hashing and JID escaping.

&gt;<i> What this would achieve:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It would save people writing new implementations hours and hours of
</I>&gt;<i> guesswork
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It would make new implementations more interoperable, reducing the
</I>&gt;<i> chance of mistakes
</I>&gt;<i> 3. It would make existing implementations more visible, improving the
</I>&gt;<i> chance of mistakes being found and reported, and implementations being
</I>&gt;<i> reused
</I>&gt;<i> 4. For experimental XEPs this would give direct evidence of how simple
</I>&gt;<i> or complex an algorithm is, what the edge cases are, and if it could be
</I>&gt;<i> simplified without losing its important characteristics
</I>
Those are all excellent goals.

&gt;<i> In fact I wouldn&#8217;t mind it being required that any XEP moving beyond
</I>&gt;<i> Experimental have implementations available for the algorithms it
</I>&gt;<i> defines, under a permissive license.
</I>
Currently the XSF requires two implementations (one open-source) for
advancement from Draft to Final. I think it's worth discussing what's
required for a XEP to move along in the XSF's standards process, but I
think that topic is separate from the main body of your message.

&gt;<i> I&#8217;m hoping to not be the only one who sees this as a problem we should
</I>&gt;<i> solve. What does everyone else think?
</I>
I think let's create a few page about this at wiki.xmpp.org and get to
work. :)
