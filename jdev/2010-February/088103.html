</I>&gt;<i> 3. It would make existing implementations more visible, improving the chance

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact I wouldn&#8217;t mind it being required that any XEP moving beyond

Problems with reference implementations:
- Programming language dependent (eg. does a Python reference
implementation help an Erlang developer?)
- Platform dependent
- Not subject to same design goals as other implementations
- Impossible to create one software which implements every XEP.
Compatibility issues between various &quot;references.&quot;
- Huge resource sink (time spent on an implementation that may not be
used by many)
- Will still have bugs which may then become de-facto standard
- (Perceived) reduction in openness of XSF and XEP process
- Political fighting over which is the &quot;official&quot; implementation

The only meaningful references are open standards and protocol/data
specs. I agree that there are many compatibility problems, because
specs are not easy to understand, but that's a fact of life in such a
heterogeneous community as XSF.

IMO the most effective answer to these problems is testing. Create a
list of challenge/response cases for servers or clients, validate
logged XMPP data in all XEP namespaces, write functional tests for
XMPP libraries, and so on. The topic of protocol test suites has come
up often but I don't know of any real progress.
