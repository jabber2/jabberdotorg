I don't think I am quite understanding your setup. How many servers are you intending to deploy? Are they all servicing one domain? Do you intend to allow automatic federation with other domains (like google talk), or are you only federating internally? XMPP Servers cannot forward traffic, in case that is what you were thinking, so simply having one server in your &quot;Web tier&quot; and one server in your &quot;App tier&quot; won't get you very far. 

I'll cover a few basics just in case there is a misunderstanding. Generally, a single XMPP server will be authoritative for one or more domains(Think &quot;gmail.com&quot; or &quot;livejournal.com&quot;). For security reasons, XMPP servers can't forward traffic, so if someone on your server wants to send a message to someone in a different domain then your XMPP server will need to be able to directly connect to the server that is authoritative for that domain (and vise-versa!). Unless you are using a jabber server which will allow you to run the S2S component on a separate machine, you will not be able to deploy as you described.

Jabberd2 does allow you to separate the S2S component from the rest of the server, but I do not recommend using Jabberd2 for various reasons. There may be a way to do what you describe using an XMPP server which supports clustering (Like Openfire or ejabberd), but that is outside of my scope of expertise. This is not a standard feature as far as I know.

There are two types of connections that an XMPP server can have: C2S (Client-to-Server) and S2S (Server-to-Server). For a client to connect to your server, it simply needs to be able to connect to the C2S port. If you are worried about someone compromising your XMPP server and using that as a point of entry to attack the rest of your network, you could simply disallow all connections to or from your &quot;App tier&quot; except for C2S connections. For automatic federation to work, you need to allow the S2S port to be open to connections from the internet as well as allow your sever to connect to make outbound connections to any port.

I hope this helps.
