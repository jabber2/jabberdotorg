It turns out I got that error because I hadn't entered my password 
(because I wanted to first see what the security/auth options were) and 
Adium didn't prompt me for it as I was expecting...

Chatopus seems to be under reasonably continued development, so maybe 
you could ask them to get with the times.. ;)

Absolutely.  Facebook explicitly state that they do not support XEP-0078 
and only return SASL options in the stream, so that's a positive. 
However they do say that it's &quot;not *currently* supported&quot; so perhaps it 
is on the cards.

Any FB developers on the lists we can convince otherwise ? :)
