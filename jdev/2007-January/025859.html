First, as much as I knew, you are not the only one doing so, therefore
after a while, there will be a rain of proofs of concepts.

Second, someone will shout, hey, but what this feature you just can not
exclude? You throw all that away and start again or will you try to
press the feature somehow into it?

I did not want to discuss how to accomplish these things, but what the
protocol should support, like it should be able to do multiplayer and
someone will want a tournament support, some games will want server-less
mode and so.

I had my chess working ad I actually only described the protocol I used.
It just got thrown away, so being you, I would discuss it earlier than
later. But of course, it's up to you, this is just MHO.

Have a nice day

Work with computer has 2 phases. First, computer waits for the user to tell it what 
to do, then the user waits for the computer to do it. Therefore, computer work 
consists mostly of waiting.
