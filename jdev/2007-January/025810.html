Right, we're mostly just re-using things there. And the RFCs have 
already gone through cross-area review anyway.

Right, that's why we need an independent security review.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not just SHA, but also SIGMA.
</I>
SIGMA is more of a philosophy than an algorithm. It underlies things 
like IKE and other technologies that have undergone fairly thorough review.

&gt;&gt;<i> See Step 1 in my previous email. A full security review of the esession
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specs by a prominent member of the security mafia is going to be part of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to see at least 2 people review it, with at least one of them 
</I>&gt;<i> unsympathetic to XMPP.
</I>
We may have money to pay for only one review. But after the first review 
and some implementation experience, I'm sure that others will start 
hacking on what we've done to find holes. :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'll be implementing RFC 3923 until then.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, and I see that you sign your email with a digital certificate using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> S/MIME. :-) IMHO RFC 3923 is simply not a go-forward technology because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the dependency on end-user PKI (hell, even very few members of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security mafia use S/MIME). The lack of a CPIM parser is the least of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the problems with RFC 3923.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If only KMail S/MIME wasn't a mess. :)
</I>
And we'll do better with S/MIME than the email world has done?
