e2e.

RFC 3920 doesn't need the same scrutiny, because it uses the off-the-shelf TLS 
protocol.  Problems in the RFC should stick out like a sore thumb to any 
security-conscious developer.  No need to bring in the security mafia.

Esessions, on the other hand, is very low level, and this means a large 
opportunity for errors (both in design and implementation).  Most of us are 
unqualified to review the esessions design, and so we definitely need experts 
to step in here and assist.

Not just SHA, but also SIGMA.

&gt;<i> See Step 1 in my previous email. A full security review of the esession

</I>&gt;<i> this.

I'd like to see at least 2 people review it, with at least one of them 
unsympathetic to XMPP.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'll be implementing RFC 3923 until then.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and I see that you sign your email with a digital certificate using

</I>
If only KMail S/MIME wasn't a mess. :)
