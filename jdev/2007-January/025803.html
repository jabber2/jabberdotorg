So let's get to work, then. :-)

&gt;<i> First, we need thorough security

</I>
All the existing specs (RFCs/MUC/etc.) or the esession specs?

Security reviews of all the existing specs is a good idea, but that 
doesn't solve the e2e problem.

&gt;<i> Then we can 
</I>&gt;<i> implement, and that will take time too.  
</I>
Right. Which is why it's time to get busy.

&gt;<i> Just to bring reality home here..  
</I>&gt;<i> show of hands for developers even doing certificate validation with TLS?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, Ian also has a tendency to incorporate bleeding edge security algorithms 
</I>&gt;<i> and procedures, that I'm not sure have received proper scrutiny..
</I>
The SHA family is broken. It's only a matter of time before SHA-256 and 
even SHA-512 are cracked (but those at least are a damn sight better 
than SHA-1). In any case these are negotiation options and we need to 
remain flexible with regard to algorithms as old ones are comprimised.

&gt;<i> The main thing I'd like to see are some security reviews by people who 
</I>&gt;<i> actually design and implement crypto.  Let's hear from Peter Guttman or Eric 
</I>&gt;<i> Rescorla.  We need prominent members in the security community that not only 
</I>&gt;<i> will do a basic error check, but will also ask important questions like, &quot;why 
</I>&gt;<i> the hell are you doing it this way?&quot; :)
</I>
See Step 1 in my previous email. A full security review of the esession 
specs by a prominent member of the security mafia is going to be part of 
this.

&gt;<i> I'll be implementing RFC 3923 until then.
</I>
Yes, and I see that you sign your email with a digital certificate using 
S/MIME. :-) IMHO RFC 3923 is simply not a go-forward technology because 
of the dependency on end-user PKI (hell, even very few members of the 
security mafia use S/MIME). The lack of a CPIM parser is the least of 
the problems with RFC 3923.
