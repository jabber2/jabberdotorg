It doesn't meet the requirements. There are two versions of the
protocol, the &quot;old&quot; one (0.9) and the new one (1.0). 1.0 was the first
official XMPP standard.

Before 1.0, there were no stream:features. A server that does not
support version='1.0' and requires &lt;stream:features&gt; would just be
silly.

&gt;<i> According to the XEP-220,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although this method of advertising protocol support has been superseded by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the use of stream features as originally defined in RFC 3920, the server dialback

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> declaration method is still used in this instance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this imply &quot; if 'version=0.9' then MUST NOT send features stanza,
</I>&gt;<i> if 'version=1.0' or higher then MUST send features stanza&quot; ?
</I>
No, XEP-0220 is not talking about sending &lt;stream:features&gt;, it is
talking about advertising dialback support *inside* &lt;stream:features&gt;.
Obviously you would only send &lt;stream:features&gt; on a 1.0 stream, but
XEP-0220 is just telling you that you should also support the old
method of advertising dialback support (xmlns:db) too.

&gt;<i> If such rules or restriction is not yet clearly described in any RFCs or XEPs,
</I>&gt;<i> I think it should be clearly described in RFC or XEP for future developers.
</I>
Your worry is a server that uses a protocol version &lt;1.0, but also
requires &lt;stream:features&gt; (a &gt;=1.0 feature). Even if such a server
exists, why should it suddenly be updated just because a new RFC/XEP
is published? If it isn't updated to 1.0, I don't see why it would be
updated to anything else.

If you ever do find such a server, first file a bug report against it,
and second... let me know :)

Regards,
Matthew
