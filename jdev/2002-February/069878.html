<PRE>You dont need HTTP or FTP because they are way too bloated as I have already
said, I come to this conclusion because they all have far more features than
are necessary, what other than resuming is really needed ??
The method I mentioned is nice and simple and does the job and can easily
support resuming using the control messages I mentioned that can be passed
along the xml stream, now although there wont be a library around for this
why would you need one, I dont know about anyone else but it would not take
me anymore than 2 maybe 3 hours to code that in C++. Instead of just using
other protocols just because they are there and trying to do a hack around
what they are really designed for just to use them, why not just spend that
time producing this simple basic protocol which is all is really needed,
there is no stopping people having HTTP functionality in their clients but
for much more universal compatibility with all types of clients lets use
something like this as a common basic/light protocol designed specifically
for the task at hand and not a bloated possibly insecure (depending on the
implementation, which if libraries were used that were produced for academic
assignments are probably not the most secure thing to use, rushed etc)
protocol that was designed for a different purpose. Also I dont know about
anyone else but I do not want to have an HTTP server running in my app, that
just invites hacking or attack, and the way it has been suggested it be
implemented it would have to be running all the time consuming CPU power,
which on small devices could be a problem, im not saying that some client
authors cant do file transfer that way too but there needs to be a common
method suitable to all devices and HTTP is not it.
