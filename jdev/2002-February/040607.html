Of course it would need to be encoded in Jabber. Problem is there is a
file size limit
in jabber. Packets can only be so long. So right now you can't just as
easily do it.
Also, you don't want some huge packet anyway

Hmm, well of course echo and discard work fine on binary data, assuming
you choose construct the send and recv functions correctly. But except
for ftp I don't think any of these are used as a a means of transfering
generic data. From what I have gleened from the jdev list is that Jabber
is supposed to be a generic backbone service, otherwise why is there any
discussion on file transfer?
