<PRE>PASS wouldn't be permanently storing mp3 and divx files and whatever
else people send, it's just a proxy.

I want to get OOB and PASS working with decent JEPs before we even begin
arguing webdav &amp; friends, because that has a lot of the filesharing and
caching issues...

As for using your own protocol, I'm not a fan of that at all. There is
really no reason to recreate HTTP/FTP and other such file-sending
protocols. The entire point of sending files out-of-bound is that there
are existing protocols which already do it and do it better, because
they have experience.

In the end, using HTTP/FTP instead of writing our own protocol probably
involves *less* work because there is craploads of code out there to
copy, and HTTP/FTP don't have any of the bugs we may be creating when we
create our own protocol.

So, again I ask for comments which tell me *what is wrong with HTTP/FTP
OOB and PASS*, not comments which tell me how you want to do it.

</I>&gt;<i> there you have two ways to find out what kind of files are offered at 
</I>&gt;<i> this client. a) you ask for a full file list of all subdirs (it is optimised, 
</I>&gt;<i> it wont send everything again each time but only the changes)
</I>&gt;<i>  b) you browse the file step by step by geting only the files of the 
</I>&gt;<i> *current* directory. for the protocol for jabberfs is only onw iq not 
</I>&gt;<i> finished yet, the jabberfs:iq:options to set the connection speed as 
</I>&gt;<i> well as some other options like &lt;firewalled/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> btw, my jabberfs:iq:filetransfer is not so complicate. in general it&#180;s 
</I>&gt;<i> nearly the same as jabber:iq:oob. maybe we can accept it as an 
</I>&gt;<i> alternative way to passing url/ it passes the ip + port
</I>&gt;<i> as well as some additional file information  (because i consider the 
</I>&gt;<i> jabber xml as a good control way for the transfer)
