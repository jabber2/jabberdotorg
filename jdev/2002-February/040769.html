Yahoo is in the process of chaning their authentication. That much is 
certain. The change has, as part of it's &quot;reason for being&quot; to kill 
3rd-party clients (among other issues, certainly that's not the only 
reason).

When I was still there, there was a cadre of folks who were trying to 
convince TPTB that getting into an AOL-style pissing contest with 
3rd-party client makers was a zero-sum game, and that Yahoo should 
instead EMBRACE those people, well, we weren't really listened to.

Things might have changed since I left there in December, mind you, 
but the discussions on this topic, on the libyahoo mailing list, seem 
to continue to bear this out.
