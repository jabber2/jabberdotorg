<PRE>Edwin-

Good to hear from you again. How's everything going for you lately?

Anyway, around the beginning of February, the jabber.com server switched
from using the open source Yahoo! transport to one developed in house for
its commercial customers. During this switch, accounts were migrated from
the old data storage system used by the open source transport, to a
slightly different one, used by Jabber, Inc.'s transport. While this
should have made the switch over work seamlessly, some accounts my need to
re-register for the transport, as something unexpected might have happened
to their usernames/passwords during the switch.

This commercial version of the transport is completely based on JECL and
uses a newer version of the Yahoo! protocol. In theory, it should be more
reliable than its open source counterpart.

If you have any further questions or problems, feel free to address them
to &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">support at jabber.com</A>&gt;, or you can always just contact me directly... I
assume you still have me in your roster. Seriously though, if you do
notice problems, let us know, we'll definitely tackle them as soon as
possible.

Cheers,

Ben
