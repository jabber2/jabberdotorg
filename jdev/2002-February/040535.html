<PRE>The protocols are fine, they were designed for that purpose, and will
work. The only thing people may ask for is authentication. I looked at
what I wrote and its storage again. I'll have to look at webdav more
than just knowing it exists, but from what I do know, its one of the
best ways to go. Why reinvent the wheel .. the protocols are there, the
technology exists, lets design and integrate :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  It would be nice to expand it so it could support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some of the following advantages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mike wants to show everyone in his office his new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal file, without attaching it and sending to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; every user.  So he uploads the file to the component
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (of whatever type is standard) and sends some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OOB message to every member of his office.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mike is hosting a music writing contest and asks all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contestants to upload their music in some format to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; his folder on his particular transfer component.  He
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wants to make them publically downloadable after the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contest is over.  There should be a way for any Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user to access that directory from their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer-supporting client.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, by having publically downloadable files, we can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set up x:data to work with it and users can search. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There could also be a central gateway which handles
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; search requests and sends them to well-known servers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for particular types of files.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe it should be required to send a Jabber IQ to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; component before downloading via HTTP.  That might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary for some access control and useful for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; statistics and logging.  We could also use that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Request IQ&quot; for requesting such things like forum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages, offline messages, public groupchat logs, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other things that might not be downloaded HTTP.
