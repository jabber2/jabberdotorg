<PRE>I'm not sure the best place to post this, but if anyone's interested,
I've made Jabber 1.4.2 RPMs for RedHat 7.2.  They're available at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.scenespot.org/rpms/redhat-7.2/">ftp://ftp.scenespot.org/rpms/redhat-7.2/</A> (both i386 and src).

Here's the readme:

Jabber RPM Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This RPM was compiled with SSL support.  Note that you need to have your
DNS entries set up for proper access to any of the transports.  The
configuration file has an option for the hostname.  Each transport will have
a hostname that is a subdomain of that base hostname, ie, if the hostname is
&quot;jabber.com&quot; then the aim transport will want to be at &quot;aim.jabber.com&quot;, the
msn transport will want to be at &quot;msn.jabber.com&quot;, etc.

Things That Are Different From The Default Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I've included all of the major transports; they were made from snapshots
  of the current CVS at the time of this writing.  Note that the &quot;aim&quot;
  package is set up as both an AIM and ICQ transport.

- Configuration files are based on the multi-process s2s model; each
  transport runs in it's own jabberd process so that if a transport goes
  down, it doesn't take down the server.

- Configuration files are templatized so that if you want a default setup
  you should only have to edit the 4 options in /etc/sysconfig/jabber to
  get a server going.

- If you want to use SSL, you will need to create a PEM file.  To make the
  proper certification file, all you should have to do is go to
  /usr/share/ssl/certs and run &quot;make jabberd.pem&quot;.

Questions?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">ben at opennms.org.</A>
This is my first run at a jabber RPM (hence the -0 revision) so I expect
there are still things that could go wrong.

I was just doing this for me, but I figured they'd be useful to someone.
Have fun...
