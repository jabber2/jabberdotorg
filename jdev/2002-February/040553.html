</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As for using your own protocol, I'm not a fan of that at all. There is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really no reason to recreate HTTP/FTP and other such file-sending
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols. The entire point of sending files out-of-bound is that there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are existing protocols which already do it and do it better, because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they have experience.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, again I ask for comments which tell me *what is wrong with HTTP/FTP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OOB and PASS*, not comments which tell me how you want to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the problem is one we've been hitting a lot in standards and
</I>&gt;<i> security discussion lately: defining target markets (i.e., what the hell are
</I>&gt;<i> you talking about?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe a lot of the controversy is really coming from the fact that &quot;file
</I>&gt;<i> transfer&quot; has almost no meaning.  One person may be seeing this as passing
</I>&gt;<i> 2k graphics files for in-chat emoticons.  Another as 2MB confidential
</I>&gt;<i> spreadsheets between coworkers.  Another as 56kb streaming media.  Another
</I>&gt;<i> as legal 2gb divx movies (webdav?), and yet another as pirated 2gb divx
</I>&gt;<i> movies (gnutella?)  Now you can be really ambitious and try and come up with
</I>&gt;<i> a single solution that meets these (and the many other) possible markets for
</I>&gt;<i> file transfer protocols.  Or you can narrow your scope.  Either way though,
</I>&gt;<i> the real critical piece is defining what we're trying to do here.  It is
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to define any sort of right or wrong criteria if we don't even
</I>&gt;<i> know what the problem is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is good to create a FT protocol.  I think it is going to be hard
</I>&gt;<i> to do so to many/most/anyone's satisfaction if you don't first say what
</I>&gt;<i> you're trying to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sarcasm alert!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So to answer your question:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is too open.  I need to control bandwidth on server x
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is too difficult.  I need async, bi-directional, connections
</I>&gt;<i> through NAT/firewalls and can't run PASS (I run no servers)
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is too fat.  I just need to send 1k emoticons and don't want to run
</I>&gt;<i> the bloat of having a compliant http client and server on my 10kb pda
</I>&gt;<i> client.
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is too limited.  I need about 100 features that neither provides.
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is too secure.  I need anonymous, under the radar FT ala JXTA
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is too insecure.  I need security as a hospital transferring
</I>&gt;<i> medical documents that must conform to HIPAA security legislation.
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is too accountable.  I need a way to trade (illegal) bytes without
</I>&gt;<i> legal liability
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is not accountable.  I need to be able to audit and limit all
</I>&gt;<i> communication and document transfer within my law/accounting firm as SEC
</I>&gt;<i> regulations require...
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is too reliable.  I need to send UDP-like streaming media where
</I>&gt;<i> missing data is best missed rather than retransmitted.
</I>&gt;<i> http/ftp is not reliable.  I need to send new programs to the controller
</I>&gt;<i> managing my x billion dollar satellite and it has to happen in real-time or
</I>&gt;<i> I'm screwed
</I>&gt;<i> And on and on and on
</I>
There's a difference between *needing* a protocol for a specific purpose
and designing a new protocol just because you don't feel like using the
existing. Especially when the new protocol has the exact same
limitations as the existing ones.
