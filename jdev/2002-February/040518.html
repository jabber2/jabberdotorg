</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   I'm just doing my 2 hour journey back to the house, and have got thinking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   about file transfer. I'm basically sending this email for thoughts on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the idea i'm working on. It takes some of the existing views, just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   expanding on a few ideas, concepts and concerns I have.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Protocol:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     HTTP is fine for this purpose. It was designed as a protocol to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     transfer files from a server to a client, which is all that we want.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     I would, however, suggest a slightly modified http server, which can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     basically measure how much of a file has been transfered to and from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the server. I'll explain this later. HTTP v1.1 has partial file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     transfer in the specification, useful to resume connections which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     have failed. It also would make it easy to have requests served by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     multiple servers, simply by returning a redirection message to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     requesting client.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Client-side:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     All that is required is a client able of talking the HTTP protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Server-side:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     As previously stated, this is just a http server, able to determine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the amount of data transfered. Every file stored on the server would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     have a record associated with it, containing the following pieces of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     information:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       Filename
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       Size
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       MD5 checksum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       List of users able to access the file, along with expiry details
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       (ACL)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Transaction:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      - Upload -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      The sender first sends a 'request to transfer', which consists of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      the filename, size and md5. The server checks against the database
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      to see if any file already exists which matches those details. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      If the file already exists, there is no need to upload the file again,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      the user is simply added to the ACL, and given an expiry time. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      value basically controls the amount of time the user is allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      collect the file before it is deleted. Once all the users listed on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      the record had either timed out or been deleted, the file would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      then be removed automatically. The sender is also informed that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      there is no need to upload.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      If the file doesn't already exist, the server checks that the size
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      value does not exceed the limit placed on the server. This value is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      not trusted, only used as a guideline. The user then starts to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      upload the file. The server monitors this, and will terminate and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      destroy the partial upload if its exceeds the size it reported.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      If the transfer is interrupted, one of two actions could be taken:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      either remove the partial upload, or keep it for a short amount of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      time, allowing the sender to resume the upload and complete it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      In either case, a message is send to the receiver with the details
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      needed to retrieve the file: filename, size and md5.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      - Download -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      The receiver sends a 'request to download', consisting of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      filename, size and md5. This, along with the ACL stored in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      files database record, help form a basic protection against files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      being downloaded by the wrong person. Its not perfect, but it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      functional without requiring unstandard extensions. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      The server would then respond either with a 'file not found', 'ok',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      or 'redirection'. A 'not authorised' would also be a possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      option, however this could be used to try and find files in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      bruteforce attack, so I personally would settle for simply a 'file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      not found' response.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Once the client is requesting from the right server and passes the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      tests, the file is available for download. The server would monitor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      the download, and would remove the user from the ACL once the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      download was successful. If the download was not successful, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      allows the receiver to resume, or the file will simply timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      - Housekeeping -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      This is simply a case of going through every record and counting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      down every user until they expire, and removing files once there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      no user left on the database record for the file.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Notes:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      The above solution is easily possible using a standard http server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      and CGI scripts, the only problems are controlling the size of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      uploads and detecting if a file transfer failed before completion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  This is all based previous discussions and idea, all i've tried to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  is bring them together into one reference. File transfer seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  becoming an increasingly requested feature, especially in regards to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  transports. My personal belief is that peer-to-peer connections open up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  a whole world of problems, such as firewalls and interconnectivity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  between different clients. The HTTP protocol works, its documented, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  implemented in all major OS's (and quite a few others too) I understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  that this increases the bandwidth required by a hosting service, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  such load could be distributed by clusters of file stores. Any thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Regards, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    David
