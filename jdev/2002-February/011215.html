sending me some info on what kind of timelines you are looking at right now
or just get me pertinent info so I can start helping you with this.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [JDEV] pthreads

The current plan is that the 1.5 series will remove pth and cleanup the
internal data model.  1.5 leads to the 1.6 stable series, and then 1.7
will add pthreads in.  1.5 will have some pthread work, such as in the
xdb layer so that we don't have major blocking in there.  As to the
speed of releases I have a lot of different plans for the 1.5 series.
We will release early, and often.  I'd be more than happy to have you on
board for it =)
