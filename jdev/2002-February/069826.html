<PRE>hello again,
it might sound annoying but as i already mentioned i&#180;m currently 
working on a filesharing component, already done parts of it, will be 
done next week(maybe).

My idea behind filetransfer was not to send the file over jabber 
server because this would flood the server soon with mp3 and divx 
movies (esspecially filesharing). Whatever we have a xml 
connection and that would be ideal to control the filetransfer, you 
can send &quot;abort&quot;, &quot;resume&quot; commands via jabber xml and do the 
byte transfer with another very primitive socket that simple creates 
a connection and pushs the data through it. In my point of view this 
has two advantages. writing tcp sockets does not need much time 
(in comparition with writing a http/ftp server). a simple tcp socket is 
easier to control then many spawned http servers. consider, that 
each http thread/http account would have to need it&#180;s own 
restrictions.
of course a http has the advantage that you can browse the 
directories and find other interesting files but what if user does not 
want to allow this? (i.e. he wants to offer this person only one file) I 
wrote a iq for my jabberfs to enable filebrowsing as well as updating 
the jabberfs databases...
<A HREF="http://skabber.rudbek.com/jabberfs/jabberfs-iq-files.txt">http://skabber.rudbek.com/jabberfs/jabberfs-iq-files.txt</A>
there you have two ways to find out what kind of files are offered at 
this client. a) you ask for a full file list of all subdirs (it is optimised, 
it wont send everything again each time but only the changes)
 b) you browse the file step by step by geting only the files of the 
*current* directory. for the protocol for jabberfs is only onw iq not 
finished yet, the jabberfs:iq:options to set the connection speed as 
well as some other options like &lt;firewalled/&gt;

btw, my jabberfs:iq:filetransfer is not so complicate. in general it&#180;s 
nearly the same as jabber:iq:oob. maybe we can accept it as an 
alternative way to passing url/ it passes the ip + port
as well as some additional file information  (because i consider the 
jabber xml as a good control way for the transfer)

cya, Edrin
