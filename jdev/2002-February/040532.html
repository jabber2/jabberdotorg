<PRE>Yes, every single person talking about file transfer stuff is talking
about the same thing. What everyone wants is more permanent caching of
files... something like webdav. I really feel it's a waste of mental
power to constantly come up with examples for why this is needed. I and
others are very well aware of the need for it. However, I would rather
figure out the problems with the current file transfer protocols and get
them fixed along with adding things such as webdav-like caching.
(Possibly even using webdav...)
