<PRE>Ah, but there are two different company.com servers, one just for the
intranet and one for the internet.  I only care about the one on the inside
and there's no need to have a firewall between it and the intranet.

Another problem with the forwarding idea is that I don't necessarily want
to locate the jabber server on the same LAN as the web server, and it
would result in all the jabber traffic making an extra trip across the WAN.
Maybe that's not very significant bandwidth-wise but it hurts reliability;
more points of failure.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; How about using SRV record for the domain? The Jabber server should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; recognize the SRV record (it's supported it since 1.2 afaik) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; connect to wherever it points to for S2S. You'd need to add something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; like this to the DNS zone for company.com:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; _jabber._tcp    IN SRV  30 30 5269 jabber.sub.company.com
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That sounds very promising.   Yesterday I happened to be looking at an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ethereal trace of the messages between the Microsoft Exchange Instant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Messenger server that's been set up in my company and one of its clients,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I saw the client doing a DNS SRV query and thought jabber needed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like that.  I had searched for something like that in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gabber source code and in the jabberd directory in the jabber server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source code but didn't think to check other directories; I found it now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under dnsrv.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't unerstand how it helps for servers to use this though.  Wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the clients have to do it?  I don't see anywhere in the gabber source where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it attemps to do anything like this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The problem with this is getting the clients to connect to the correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; server, if you just set them to connect to &quot;jabber.sub.company.com&quot; then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; they will send &quot;jabber.sub.company.com&quot; as the to attribute of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; opening &lt;stream:stream&gt; tag which makes the server look for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;jabber.sub.company.com&quot; in the spool directory.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The only solution I can see to this is for clients to support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; connecting to an address which is different from the server name. In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the client I am developing I allow the user to specify the name of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; server in the username field by entering it in the form:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at server.com.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think I know what you mean.  We experimented with changing the name that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the server calls itself to company.com while still saying the server was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jabber.sub.company.com when logging in, hoping that at least jabber ids
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could then be thought of as <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">id at company.com</A>, but gabber couldn't handle it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any other ideas on how to do this?
