<PRE>Hi all,

  I'm just doing my 2 hour journey back to the house, and have got thinking
  about file transfer. I'm basically sending this email for thoughts on
  the idea i'm working on. It takes some of the existing views, just
  expanding on a few ideas, concepts and concerns I have.

  Protocol:

    HTTP is fine for this purpose. It was designed as a protocol to
    transfer files from a server to a client, which is all that we want.
    I would, however, suggest a slightly modified http server, which can
    basically measure how much of a file has been transfered to and from
    the server. I'll explain this later. HTTP v1.1 has partial file
    transfer in the specification, useful to resume connections which
    have failed. It also would make it easy to have requests served by
    multiple servers, simply by returning a redirection message to the
    requesting client.

  Client-side:
  
    All that is required is a client able of talking the HTTP protocol.
    
  Server-side:

    As previously stated, this is just a http server, able to determine
    the amount of data transfered. Every file stored on the server would
    have a record associated with it, containing the following pieces of
    information:

      Filename
      Size
      MD5 checksum
      List of users able to access the file, along with expiry details
      (ACL)

   Transaction:

     - Upload -
     The sender first sends a 'request to transfer', which consists of
     the filename, size and md5. The server checks against the database
     to see if any file already exists which matches those details. 
     
     If the file already exists, there is no need to upload the file again,
     the user is simply added to the ACL, and given an expiry time. This
     value basically controls the amount of time the user is allowed to
     collect the file before it is deleted. Once all the users listed on
     the record had either timed out or been deleted, the file would
     then be removed automatically. The sender is also informed that
     there is no need to upload.

     If the file doesn't already exist, the server checks that the size
     value does not exceed the limit placed on the server. This value is
     not trusted, only used as a guideline. The user then starts to
     upload the file. The server monitors this, and will terminate and
     destroy the partial upload if its exceeds the size it reported.
     
     If the transfer is interrupted, one of two actions could be taken:
     either remove the partial upload, or keep it for a short amount of
     time, allowing the sender to resume the upload and complete it.

     In either case, a message is send to the receiver with the details
     needed to retrieve the file: filename, size and md5.
     
     - Download -
     The receiver sends a 'request to download', consisting of the
     filename, size and md5. This, along with the ACL stored in the
     files database record, help form a basic protection against files
     being downloaded by the wrong person. Its not perfect, but it is
     functional without requiring unstandard extensions. 

     The server would then respond either with a 'file not found', 'ok',
     or 'redirection'. A 'not authorised' would also be a possible
     option, however this could be used to try and find files in a
     bruteforce attack, so I personally would settle for simply a 'file
     not found' response.

     Once the client is requesting from the right server and passes the
     tests, the file is available for download. The server would monitor
     the download, and would remove the user from the ACL once the
     download was successful. If the download was not successful, this
     allows the receiver to resume, or the file will simply timeout.

     - Housekeeping -
     This is simply a case of going through every record and counting
     down every user until they expire, and removing files once there is
     no user left on the database record for the file.

   Notes:

     The above solution is easily possible using a standard http server
     and CGI scripts, the only problems are controlling the size of
     uploads and detecting if a file transfer failed before completion.

 This is all based previous discussions and idea, all i've tried to do
 is bring them together into one reference. File transfer seems to be
 becoming an increasingly requested feature, especially in regards to
 transports. My personal belief is that peer-to-peer connections open up
 a whole world of problems, such as firewalls and interconnectivity
 between different clients. The HTTP protocol works, its documented, and
 implemented in all major OS's (and quite a few others too) I understand
 that this increases the bandwidth required by a hosting service, but
 such load could be distributed by clusters of file stores. Any thoughts?

 Regards, 

   David
