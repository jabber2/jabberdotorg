<PRE>The main problems I see are that HTTP/FTP are far too bloated protocols, all
is really needed just like msn, icq, and aim is just a basic protocol for
sending the file p2p, thats what IM file transfers are, you dont need all
this storing of files for offline users and uploading to HTTP servers, if
someone wants to send a file to someone who is offline they will email it to
them, if someone wants to put the file up and lets lots of people access it
they will upload it to their website, there is no need to make this a
hundred times more complicated than it needs to be, all IM file transfer
needs to be is a quick way to send files p2p, and the best way I see of
doing that is just opening up a socket, get the other person to connect and
then just stream the data to them, maybe with a few control messages sent
over the xml stream, and if they are behind NAT's and could not connect then
just make it automatically retry using PASS instead of a direct connection,
lets just keep this simple guys. This way it keeps things simple you dont
have to have the bloat and insecurity of having a HTTP/FTP server/client
software built into the client, it also helps keep things more legally
safe/secure as the files are not being saved anywhere other than on the
machines of the two people sending/receiving the file, and also saves on
having to setup all sorts of webdav storage servers and all the unnesessary
complexity and cost thats involves.

Well just my 2p.
