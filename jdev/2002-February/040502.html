I think they can (or will soon.)  I recall just recently reading an article
about the new domain names being issued (or about to be issued) with
non-english character sets.  The article was discussing the obvious methods
of stealing domains or hijacking browsers by registering identical looking
domains that are spelled differently (mixing characters from different
character sets.)  For example, some russian characters look the same as
english (arabic) characters but are in fact different (with different
character codes and different pronunciations.)  The article was warning
people that they may need to start scanning for, and alerting users to
domain names that contain characters from different character sets in the
same name...  So if it is not here now, it is on its way soon.  One of the
costs of expanding the Internet outside of the english world I guess. :)
