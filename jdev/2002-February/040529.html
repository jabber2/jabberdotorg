<PRE>Hi all,

  I think part of the problem is that HTTP/FTP OOB + PASS is good up to
a point, but there needs to be an additional part, which is what I was
trying to address. I know of someone on the jdev conference area (I
think its Simon, but its late and i'm half asleep) who is using PASS for
streaming data. This is all fine and good for small things, but not
random files like many people on IMs like to throw at their contact list
.. and OOB would be the communication mechanism between the server
software and the clients, but I can see a lot of potential wastage of
bandwidth if thats all you use. Take the person who sends a file to 5
people all on the same jabber server .. only one upload was required if
you take a system like the one I suggested, and the users don't have to
be online. It keeps the files, which could be anything, seperate from
the users data on the jabber server. It gives a standard for other
people to work with. HTTP/FTP OOB as it stands basically says that i'm
going to somehow upload a file somewhere, and tell you where it is ..
what I'm trying for is saying 'where' the file is going, and how you can
go collect it.

The system I suggested would not be any good for things like streamed
voice or images, but then again, thats another reason for having PASS.

David
