<PRE>i want the external ip... outside of NAT.

in many cases, the client will have been port forwarded through their 
nat router, so it will indeed work.  and once the routers have uPnP 
installed on them, this will be the case all the time.

and yes, i understand that i could use a third party fileserver, but i 
want this to be peer to peer.

and it's not an issue that my client will only work with a server with 
this mod installed, because my client will ONLY ever talk to my server.

so, my original question remains... does anyone have a way to get the ip 
address of the client from inside of a server component.
