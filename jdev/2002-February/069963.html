</I>Unfortunately groupchat is in a state of flux right now (and 
unfortunately, it is my fault..). The 1.4 server includes a 'conference' 
module which implements a protocol known as generic conferencing - this 
is no longer owned technically by anyone, and isn't being pushed forward 
as a standard. I proposed a different specification for something called 
'jabber conferencing framework', which took the generic conferencing 
stuff and added features, defined behavior a bit, defined events on the 
stream so that they didn't need to be sent as plaintext, and defined the 
concept of an extension. There are two implementations of this which I 
know of - an IRC transport done by Benoit, and a native implementation I 
did for Jabber, Inc. which they sell commercially (and I believe 
included in the downloadable JCP Express version). That implementation 
adds a few optional extensions, and also changes the namespace used to 
'jcf-draft3' (since jabber:iq:conference is used by generic 
conferencing, and neither should have used a jabber:* namespace until 
they became official standards)

Right now, the only 'standard' way of doing groupchat is the original 
groupchat protocol. On the positive side, this is the simplest protocol 
possible. On the negative side, there are a lot of features you simply 
can't expose via groupchat, such as password-protected rooms. Hopefully 
work on finishing the standard resumes soon.
