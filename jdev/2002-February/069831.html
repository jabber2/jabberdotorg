Which is not necessarily true. If I want to distribute some kind of
files to a lot of people, I upload it to my website. 

The file transfer feature I demand from a decent IM system is
filling the gap between cut and paste to the message window and sending
an email with an attachment. I want to be able to send a simple image or
sound file to the person I am talking with, and I don't want to use a
completely different protocol to do this. I don't care what kind of
handshake happens between jabber clients. I want to send a file to the
person I am talking to. Period. It may use FTP or HTTP internally, or it
may use something completely different.

Please don't try to invent every single RFC from scratch within jabber.
There are perfectly good prototcols around on the internet which do
their job better than jabber can ever do. Concentrate on situations
where direct XML routing is better than exisiting protocols.
