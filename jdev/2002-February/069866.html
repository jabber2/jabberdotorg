<PRE>Didn't I read on /. not too long about about a libhttp that came under 44k and suitable for embeded devices? This sounds like a simple solution and exactly what Julian is talking about.

If all you're doing is sending or receiving a file, I really don't think
HTTP or FTP are too bloated. In the end, after you've reimplemented
every feature from HTTP/FTP we'll want, like resuming, the amount of
work put in to creating such a protocol will be so much more than just
using HTTP and FTP. Don't tell me you can't find a library to add HTTP
or FTP support. I'm fairly certain that most people getting a CS degree
have to write one or the other at some point in their studies, so it's
not like they're impossible to find.
