<PRE>Offline support and multicast are covered by more permanent caching, aka
webdav-like stuff (or webdav).

What do you mean by firewall support? What's needed that can't be
handled with PASS?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   I think part of the problem is that HTTP/FTP OOB + PASS is good up to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a point, but there needs to be an additional part, which is what I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; trying to address. I know of someone on the jdev conference area (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; think its Simon, but its late and i'm half asleep) who is using PASS for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; streaming data. This is all fine and good for small things, but not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; random files like many people on IMs like to throw at their contact list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; .. and OOB would be the communication mechanism between the server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; software and the clients, but I can see a lot of potential wastage of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; bandwidth if thats all you use. Take the person who sends a file to 5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; people all on the same jabber server .. only one upload was required if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you take a system like the one I suggested, and the users don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be online. It keeps the files, which could be anything, seperate from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the users data on the jabber server. It gives a standard for other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; people to work with. HTTP/FTP OOB as it stands basically says that i'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; going to somehow upload a file somewhere, and tell you where it is ..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what I'm trying for is saying 'where' the file is going, and how you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; go collect it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The system I suggested would not be any good for things like streamed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; voice or images, but then again, thats another reason for having PASS.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A lot of people have been talking about all sorts of ways to do file

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out of the current file transfer implementations, I want to know what's

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So my question is: What is wrong with the current HTTP/FTP OOB + PASS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Currently the list is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - limited to HTTP/FTP (need a better way to indicate protocols
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supported, possibly browse?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - PASS doesn't allow more permanent file caching
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - lack of documentation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - lack of implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; And before anyone says anything, by lack of implementation I mean that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it's not extremely widely implemented, in fact I'm not aware of any PASS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; client implementations yet. However, jabber.org does have PASS support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; and some clients already do HTTP/FTP OOB.
