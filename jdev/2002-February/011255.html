This works fine, until we hit the internet and suddenly
bandwidth costs money. From a business point of view
multicast transfers are a means for clients to push
costs onto whoever runs the server. Personally, I doubt
there will be a lot of Jabber servers doing this. It
is, after all, one of the major reasons why p2p file
transfers took off.

You mean like Tucows and Napster? [1]

I think this is also a boundary discussion: are we trying
to make Jabber capable of doing everything that &quot;the 
internet&quot; can do? If not, where do we draw the line?

Moz
[1] I don't mean that as a variant Godwins invocation, BTW.
