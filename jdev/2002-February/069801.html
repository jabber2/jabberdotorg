<PRE>It sounds quite cool, but I just have a few quick questions:
Can you please define &quot;server?&quot;
Can you please define &quot;client?&quot;
Can you please define &quot;sender?&quot;
Can you please define &quot;receiver?&quot;
Can you please define &quot;user?&quot;

I was having a little trouble following the specifics, and I suspect that
a more concrete definition for each term will probably help me out a bit.

Sorry,

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   I'm just doing my 2 hour journey back to the house, and have got thinking
</I>&gt;<i>   about file transfer. I'm basically sending this email for thoughts on
</I>&gt;<i>   the idea i'm working on. It takes some of the existing views, just
</I>&gt;<i>   expanding on a few ideas, concepts and concerns I have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Protocol:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     HTTP is fine for this purpose. It was designed as a protocol to
</I>&gt;<i>     transfer files from a server to a client, which is all that we want.
</I>&gt;<i>     I would, however, suggest a slightly modified http server, which can
</I>&gt;<i>     basically measure how much of a file has been transfered to and from
</I>&gt;<i>     the server. I'll explain this later. HTTP v1.1 has partial file
</I>&gt;<i>     transfer in the specification, useful to resume connections which
</I>&gt;<i>     have failed. It also would make it easy to have requests served by
</I>&gt;<i>     multiple servers, simply by returning a redirection message to the
</I>&gt;<i>     requesting client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Client-side:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>     All that is required is a client able of talking the HTTP protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>   Server-side:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     As previously stated, this is just a http server, able to determine
</I>&gt;<i>     the amount of data transfered. Every file stored on the server would
</I>&gt;<i>     have a record associated with it, containing the following pieces of
</I>&gt;<i>     information:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       Filename
</I>&gt;<i>       Size
</I>&gt;<i>       MD5 checksum
</I>&gt;<i>       List of users able to access the file, along with expiry details
</I>&gt;<i>       (ACL)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Transaction:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      - Upload -
</I>&gt;<i>      The sender first sends a 'request to transfer', which consists of
</I>&gt;<i>      the filename, size and md5. The server checks against the database
</I>&gt;<i>      to see if any file already exists which matches those details. 
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>      If the file already exists, there is no need to upload the file again,
</I>&gt;<i>      the user is simply added to the ACL, and given an expiry time. This
</I>&gt;<i>      value basically controls the amount of time the user is allowed to
</I>&gt;<i>      collect the file before it is deleted. Once all the users listed on
</I>&gt;<i>      the record had either timed out or been deleted, the file would
</I>&gt;<i>      then be removed automatically. The sender is also informed that
</I>&gt;<i>      there is no need to upload.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      If the file doesn't already exist, the server checks that the size
</I>&gt;<i>      value does not exceed the limit placed on the server. This value is
</I>&gt;<i>      not trusted, only used as a guideline. The user then starts to
</I>&gt;<i>      upload the file. The server monitors this, and will terminate and
</I>&gt;<i>      destroy the partial upload if its exceeds the size it reported.
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>      If the transfer is interrupted, one of two actions could be taken:
</I>&gt;<i>      either remove the partial upload, or keep it for a short amount of
</I>&gt;<i>      time, allowing the sender to resume the upload and complete it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      In either case, a message is send to the receiver with the details
</I>&gt;<i>      needed to retrieve the file: filename, size and md5.
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>      - Download -
</I>&gt;<i>      The receiver sends a 'request to download', consisting of the
</I>&gt;<i>      filename, size and md5. This, along with the ACL stored in the
</I>&gt;<i>      files database record, help form a basic protection against files
</I>&gt;<i>      being downloaded by the wrong person. Its not perfect, but it is
</I>&gt;<i>      functional without requiring unstandard extensions. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The server would then respond either with a 'file not found', 'ok',
</I>&gt;<i>      or 'redirection'. A 'not authorised' would also be a possible
</I>&gt;<i>      option, however this could be used to try and find files in a
</I>&gt;<i>      bruteforce attack, so I personally would settle for simply a 'file
</I>&gt;<i>      not found' response.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Once the client is requesting from the right server and passes the
</I>&gt;<i>      tests, the file is available for download. The server would monitor
</I>&gt;<i>      the download, and would remove the user from the ACL once the
</I>&gt;<i>      download was successful. If the download was not successful, this
</I>&gt;<i>      allows the receiver to resume, or the file will simply timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      - Housekeeping -
</I>&gt;<i>      This is simply a case of going through every record and counting
</I>&gt;<i>      down every user until they expire, and removing files once there is
</I>&gt;<i>      no user left on the database record for the file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Notes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The above solution is easily possible using a standard http server
</I>&gt;<i>      and CGI scripts, the only problems are controlling the size of
</I>&gt;<i>      uploads and detecting if a file transfer failed before completion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  This is all based previous discussions and idea, all i've tried to do
</I>&gt;<i>  is bring them together into one reference. File transfer seems to be
</I>&gt;<i>  becoming an increasingly requested feature, especially in regards to
</I>&gt;<i>  transports. My personal belief is that peer-to-peer connections open up
</I>&gt;<i>  a whole world of problems, such as firewalls and interconnectivity
</I>&gt;<i>  between different clients. The HTTP protocol works, its documented, and
</I>&gt;<i>  implemented in all major OS's (and quite a few others too) I understand
</I>&gt;<i>  that this increases the bandwidth required by a hosting service, but
</I>&gt;<i>  such load could be distributed by clusters of file stores. Any thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Regards, 
</I>&gt;<i>
