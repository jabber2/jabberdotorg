<PRE>Well, i personally have problems to find a free http server that does 
has not any open source license, is not a dll and supports upload. 
Therefor I would have to write one myself. And that would be much 
more work then doing a simple socket connection to stream the file 
(as described in my jabberfs:iq:filetransfer protocol).

In addition to that if i would find such a lib there is still the question, 
would it support several instances with not too much memory 
usage with different ports/passwords for each person that is 
downloading, would your application get information about what ppl 
currently download what file, with what kind of speed they do it....

Doing such a simple socket connection would allow you to get 
these information on the fly and abort downloads very easy, 
password protect them very easy (because you do the filetransfer 
negotiation with XML stream). 

I can accept the opinion ppl (esspecially those on linux) that they 
want http and such stuff because indeed this offers interesting stuff 
like storing the files on servers, doing the PASS thing and who 
knows what other kind of stuff would be possible. I would like to get 
my client working befor i start writing my own http server. Could 
add this as a new feature then...

Why can&#180;t we have those two standart, http for more complex 
filetransactions and the easy socket filetransfer for simple client 
2client filetransfer??
