<PRE>Hi,
 
I have installed and started the jabber server. To my knowledge there are no
errors starting the server. I can ping the server by name and IP from the
client pc. I tried to telnet to the server with the command &quot;telnet
10.158.35.150 5222&quot; I come to a blinking cursor which I think tells me the
system is listening on the port. When I try to create an account from the
client pc I put in the information but when it tries to connects to the
server it says &quot;Jabber can't connect to your jabber server. This may be
because your behind a firewall.&quot;
I don't think I have the firewall on the server set to close any ports(I'm
new to Linux), but I'm behind a corporate firewall. Do I need the port 5222
opened in the main(corporate) firewall even though all clients are coming
from inside the firewall on an internal network? Please, any help would be
appreciated.
 
Ron
