Anyway, you make a good point. My problem is that I see a lot of people
who don't really need different protocols, seem to have the exact same
problems and needs, and keep redesigning the same protocol repeatedly.
That is why I am asking what is wrong with the existing protocols, to
figure out what all these people need that the existing protocols don't
provide, and get together with the people who have common needs to
create a common protocol.
