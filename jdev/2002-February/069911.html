Are you sure it would be enough, wont the libraries that the clients are
built with be expecting all sorts of headers not just the request responses,
how extensible does the simple streaming protocol really need to be, all it
is supposed to be for is directly streaming a file p2p from one person to
another simply and easily, not having to deal with HTTP requests, and the
fact that the person might not immediately retrieve the file meaning that
you have to keep the port open indefinately until someone connects and
retrieves the file, which might not even be the real person, by doing this
streaming protocol you can do the negotiation and control over the xml
stream and it ends up being much easier and far more secure, im sure if you
needed to add any security into the HTTP example provided it would make it a
hell of a lot more complicated.
