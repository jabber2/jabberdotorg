Agreed.  But being a bit of a skeptic, I think it may be a waste of effort
to try and provide interop support now.  For some reason there seems to be a
lot of standardization efforts in this space that mysteriously stay
vaporware despite who is on the committees.  So my only reservation would be
to see some actual rollouts and numbers before considering it &quot;for real.&quot;
OTOH, if someone has the spare time, and wants to play around with building
transports... :)
