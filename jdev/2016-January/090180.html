<PRE>A feature that I have seen in some email services, but it is far from being common, is the integration of conversations history with the email account.

Fastmail does it (or did it, it should be ending its life this month, from their annoucement a while ago); someone told me Yandex also does it.

But what makes me ask this here is: isn't the email integration of history something that could be offered by ejabberd (and maybe also other open servers)? Further, it could be integrated with any email accounts! Users could have the option to register any email accounts to receive the history logs. And the history would be kept safe independently of which client the person used at any time.

Does this exist already? If not, what do think about it? I would like to hear more opinions, since my ideas might be improved.

Regards

</PRE>
