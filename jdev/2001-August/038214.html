  Why is this a bad idea?  Use jabbaer:x:*, which is meant for extentions.

  I agree in at least one point, though.  There should be a jabber:iq:storage 
or simular namespace, and NOT a module that snarfs up everything it darned well 
pleases..

&gt;<i> So isn't this kind of a monkey wrench in the whole Jabber extensibility
</I>&gt;<i> story? The functionality of IQ queries has been greatly reduced by 
</I>&gt;<i> this -- now, to define a new query type you have to hack the server to
</I>&gt;<i> get around mod_xml, otherwise the clients won't be able to talk to each
</I>&gt;<i> other.
</I>
  Naw, just puts a predifined limitation on the use of xmlns within iq packets, 
and keeps developers within the jabber:* domain for iq messages.  Not sure if 
that was the intent or not..

&gt;<i> mod_xml looks like a really poorly thought-out idea. It would have been
</I>&gt;<i> great had it reserved some particular namespace and only handled queries
</I>&gt;<i> in children of that, but by eating the entire namespace universe apart
</I>&gt;<i> from &quot;jabber:&quot;, it leaves no room for anything else.
</I>
  I think it was a down and dirty quick and easy way to identify xml set/get 
that could be stored and processed by the server.

&gt;<i> (Or have I managed to completely misunderstand those few pages of C 
</I>&gt;<i> code?)
</I>
  Nope, that small peice of code is what does it.  I hadn't remembered it was 
in there.  8-P  Basically, use jabber:x:jens:extention for now.  8-P

  And don't sound so darned negative about everything, it'll give ya 
wrinkles..  8-)
