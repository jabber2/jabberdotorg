&gt;<i> I'm trying to grok the vague description of jabber:iq:browse on the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Protocol-Draft&quot; section of the DocZone:
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/draft-proto/html/browsing.html">http://docs.jabber.org/draft-proto/html/browsing.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> As always, if this is the wrong thing to look at and there's a 
</I>&gt;<i> conflicting but more accurate description somewhere else, let me know!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The primary thing that's gotten me confused is the apparent ambiguity 
</I>&gt;<i> of a &quot;set&quot; query using this namespace. It seems to be used for two 
</I>&gt;<i> entirely different things:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Sent to a watcher as a &quot;push&quot; to notify a watcher of new data in 
</I>&gt;<i> the *sender*s browse space.
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Sent to a browse source to edit (add/modify/delete) data in the 
</I>&gt;<i> *receiver*s browse space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general I don't see how these two things can be distinguished from 
</I>&gt;<i> each other. If you look at the two examples in the &quot;Live Browsing&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Editing&quot; sections, they are fundamentally identical; only the type of 
</I>&gt;<i> data elements in the payload is different. Yet the two have very 
</I>&gt;<i> different meanings and in fact describe data on two different JIDs! 
</I>&gt;<i> The sinking feeling I have is that when receiving such a &quot;set&quot; you 
</I>&gt;<i> have to make a judgment call based on the exact type of data contained 
</I>&gt;<i> and the exact JID you received the query from. I imagine that this is 
</I>&gt;<i> _usually_ possible, but it makes me nervous and doesn't seem like a 
</I>&gt;<i> good design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO it's the &quot;push&quot; feature that seems wrong -- it's a misuse of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;set&quot;. The exact meaning of &quot;get&quot; and &quot;set&quot; is already pretty vague 
</I>&gt;<i> due to all the uses they've been put to, but it seems that you can at 
</I>&gt;<i> least rely on the fact that they apply to the _receiver_ of the query. 
</I>&gt;<i> But browse pushes turn this on its head.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What this really points out is the lack of a general purpose 
</I>&gt;<i> subscription/notification mechanism in Jabber, which is ironic since 
</I>&gt;<i> this is so central to presence. Jabber's &lt;presence&gt; element and its 
</I>&gt;<i> subscription model are completely hardwired for one particular type of 
</I>&gt;<i> data (presence state and status text) and cannot be used for anything 
</I>&gt;<i> else. There is a lot of other info that one might want to subscribe 
</I>&gt;<i> to, ranging from buddy icons to lists of shared files to news 
</I>&gt;<i> headlines, but no good mechanism to manage the subscriptions and 
</I>&gt;<i> notifications required by real-time updates of this information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any comments? Am I totally off-base here? Are the existing efforts to 
</I>&gt;<i> remedy this? (I'm aware of the Profiles JIG and have just joined it.)
</I>
As far as I understand, if the JID of the top element within the browse 
matches the JID being requested, it is a replace. If it doesn't match, 
then you are representing a child and are doing an insert/modify/delete.
