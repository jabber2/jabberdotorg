  DoH!  I stand corrected.  The server has this currently implemented as a 
server module ALREADY as mod_xml.  The applicable cose is located at 
<A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/cvs/jabber2/jsm/modules/mod_xml.c">http://download.jabber.org/cvs/jabber2/jsm/modules/mod_xml.c</A>

  It functions exactly as the document specs...

&gt;<i> I have no interest in writing a server-side module, I just want to 
</I>&gt;<i> define a protocol extension that instances of my client can use. Please
</I>&gt;<i> don't tell me that the server has to be hacked whenever clients want to

</I>
  To communicate with eachother, nope.  To have the server support doing 
something?  Yes, but in this case, Jer already did the work to have the server 
handle it for you..  8-P

  Basically, do a set on ANY *NON* jabber:* namespace, and it will store it.
