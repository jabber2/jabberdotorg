No, that isn't the issue. My point is that in the case of a normal &quot;set&quot; 
the semantics are to modify data belonging to the _receiver_ of the 
query, but in the funny case of a push the semantics are a notification 
of already-modified data belonging to the _sender_.

But it does look as though the ambiguity can be resolved by comparing 
the JID of the sender of the query with the JID of the top-level element 
in the payload; if they're the same (modulo resources) then it's a push, 
otherwise it's a set request. I dunno what happens in the special case 
where one resource sends such a query to another resource of the same 
JID, though! (Hmm, the ambiguity has put on weight.)

Question: is it required that every item in a browse have a JID? If so, 
how do you represent items that are subcomponents of a client 
connection? For example, what got me started on this is that I want to 
figure out how to do file sharing. My plan is (was?) to have the client 
respond to a browse request by listing the hierarchy of files it has 
available. But these files don't have their own JIDs, so what do I use?
