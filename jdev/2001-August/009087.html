<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; From: &quot;Fabien Ninoles&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">fabien at Nightbird.Dynamic.TZoNE.ORG</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I can see three different kinds of &quot;room proxy&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This way all the users can join a local chat room which has a proxy to
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; main chat room on a different server. Is this one of the requirements
</I>for
&gt;<i> &gt; the conferencing group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understand the last sentence but I don't think that it
</I>&gt;<i> anything we discuss until then is a requirements for the conferencing
</I>&gt;<i> service.
</I>

Let's see if I can explain this better. It could be that the functionality
that I am asking for is already implemented but I have not found this in any
documentation.

Let assume there are 100 users connected to Jabber.com and another 100 users
connected to Jabber.org. There is a user 'John' connected to Jabber.com.
Now, there is an important conference at a room hosted by jabber.org called
'dev-conf'. So, all the 200 users connected to the room at Jabber.org.

Now 'John' sends 'Hi' to the room. So, the Jabber.com server will send the
'Hi' message to 'dev-conf' at Jabber.org. What does the conference room do
now -
a) Sends out 200 messages out to all the users connected or
b) Sends out 101 messages (100 messages to it locally connected users and 1
message to the proxy room at Jabber.com)

Can someone who understands the conference part answer the above question.
If the answer is b, then I think we can expand the similar concept to
external IM systems. If the answer is a, then there is a scalability problem
for Information distribution. Side topic - How does SIP handle this.

This concept is present in IRC where they have S2S connections and where
channels can span across multiple servers.

Ashvil
