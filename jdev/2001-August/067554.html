Well, I spoke with Colin (we are both with Vedalabs) about this and he
mentioned that Jabber does not guarantee delivery. Is this true? If so
then any application that requires all messages to be delivered will
have to include some type of ACK feature.. I would think.

I can do this. Note however that jabberd has to be under a high load for
the problem to occur. That means you can expect _a lot_ of debug and log
data. Perhaps you would like to run the test suite on a personal test
box? It may be easier for you to see what data you need? Otherwise you
can expect a 50MB email from me. :)

Hmm, a while ago a guy from the OSDN asked for developer access to the
testing tools. It would be nice if he could run it on his test boxes as
well, but I'm not sure what happened to him.

Regards, Dustin

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; traffic among many concurrent servers running on the same or

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, now that I know someone else has had a similar experience I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only assume the problem is with jabberd. I had hoped that jabber.org
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would confirm this to either be a problem or something they had built
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into jabberd, but that information hasn't been very forthcoming.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the end I suppose developers using jabberd need to realize that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only works in low to medium load environments where message delivery is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not a big issue. Unfortunately, I am not sure if the same is true of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jabber.com server since they didn't present any information on this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; topic either.
