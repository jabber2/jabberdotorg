<PRE>Like I posted earlier I need more specifics to investigate this.  Having clients
build in safeguards is ridiculous!  This would be a server bug by far if no
bounce is happening and it is actually getting lost somehow.  It has high 
priority in my books, but I need info, debug logs, incoming/outgoing XML for 
both parties involved, and anything else that will help.

</I>&gt;<i> In the end I suppose developers using jabberd need to realize that it

</I>&gt;<i> jabber.com server since they didn't present any information on this
</I>&gt;<i> topic either.
