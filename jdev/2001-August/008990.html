<PRE>Yeah I think sheath is doing stuff with them.  The reason I ask about bounces,
is because most of the queues that have set lenght or sizes will bounce back to
sender if they are overflowed (as far as I'm to understand).  So although there
isn't guaranteed delivery, there is a response if it can't be.  That's why I 
say clients shouldn't need ACK's.  Although IQ msgs are always discussed.

</I>&gt;<i> I can do this. Note however that jabberd has to be under a high load for

</I>&gt;<i> data. Perhaps you would like to run the test suite on a personal test
</I>&gt;<i> box? It may be easier for you to see what data you need? Otherwise you
</I>&gt;<i> can expect a 50MB email from me. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, a while ago a guy from the OSDN asked for developer access to the
</I>&gt;<i> testing tools. It would be nice if he could run it on his test boxes as
</I>&gt;<i> well, but I'm not sure what happened to him.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notice that at &gt;= 120 user pairs (240 connected users), which equates to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 120 msg/sec in this test, my message loss rate varies from 3% to 13%. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The average delivery also climbs to .14 seconds, but I don't consider 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that a problem. (However, the worst case delivery times are bad: &gt; 6 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds for 150 and 160 user pairs.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; We've just developed a project (client+server) for one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; biggest ISP in Italy. We found since the beginning that each 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Jabber server was not able to handle more than a couple hundreds 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; client, so we implemented an architecture that load balances the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; traffic among many concurrent servers running on the same or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; different hosts. We also encountered message losses, but we didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; care much :-). As Dustin, we thought this was due to client 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; problems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Well, now that I know someone else has had a similar experience I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; only assume the problem is with jabberd. I had hoped that jabber.org
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would confirm this to either be a problem or something they had built
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; into jabberd, but that information hasn't been very forthcoming.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In the end I suppose developers using jabberd need to realize that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; only works in low to medium load environments where message delivery is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not a big issue. Unfortunately, I am not sure if the same is true of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; jabber.com server since they didn't present any information on this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; topic either.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
