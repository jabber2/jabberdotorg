Well, now that I know someone else has had a similar experience I can
only assume the problem is with jabberd. I had hoped that jabber.org
would confirm this to either be a problem or something they had built
into jabberd, but that information hasn't been very forthcoming.

In the end I suppose developers using jabberd need to realize that it
only works in low to medium load environments where message delivery is
not a big issue. Unfortunately, I am not sure if the same is true of the
jabber.com server since they didn't present any information on this
topic either.

Regards, Dustin
