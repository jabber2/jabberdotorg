<PRE>First, sorry for the late answer, I was quite busy last weeks.

</I>
OK, with the current implementation, there is no proxy room. So, the
jabber server really sent 200 messages, part of it going through the S2S
connection.  AFAIK, no digest is send.

The proposition I made for an implementation of proxy room has a goal to
implement this kind of digest over the current protocol in a sample
manner.  The digest is done because the jabber.com server has also a
room with the same name and both room interconnected each other.  So in
fact, you have:

1- A room in jabber.org, with 101 users connected, 1 of them being the
jabber.com room.
2- A room in jabber.com, with 101 users connected, 1 of them being the
jabber.org room.

There is no difference between room 1 and room 2, and, for most
application, room 1 see room 2 simply as another user with multiple
nicks.

&gt;<i> Can someone who understands the conference part answer the above question.
</I>&gt;<i> If the answer is b, then I think we can expand the similar concept to
</I>&gt;<i> external IM systems. If the answer is a, then there is a scalability problem
</I>&gt;<i> for Information distribution. Side topic - How does SIP handle this.
</I>
The answer is A and it's what I try to circumvent with the proxy-room
(that's it, a proxy between two rooms) proposition.

&gt;<i> This concept is present in IRC where they have S2S connections and where
</I>&gt;<i> channels can span across multiple servers.
</I>
Some automation could be expand in a latter time, so that the user
always connected to the right server... but then, you'll need a network
of server/transport, interconnected with each other, with rooms sending
presence to all the network and doing a kind of negociations of room
names...  Really, I think this should be a different kind of rooms since
it ask for so much negociation (with trusted/untrusted network peers,
etc.)  At least, adding the room proxy, is simply a question of adding a
new users, with nickname negociation being resume to suffix all proxy
nicknames with @otherroom, for example.
