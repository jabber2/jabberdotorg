That's what I was saying when I discussed this over here. I don't see
why additional logins would slow down jabberd, but it appears to be
doing just that. 

I performed a second test, just to confirm. I had a process logging in
1000 users, and I noticed login time went from .1 to .7 seconds as n1 =
1 -&gt; 1000. Ok, so I started another process logging in users n2 = 1001
-&gt; 2000. As n2 logged in it took the same amount of time as n1 was
taking at that time, and when I killed the first process (n1), n2's
login times decreased dramatically afterward, although there seemed to
be a initial pause as jabberd dropped the n1 users.

Regarding the version, I'm looking in the README and see Jabber 1.4.
Matt, is that correct?

Regards, Dustin
