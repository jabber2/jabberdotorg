<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I had some time yesterday and today to play with jabbertest and jabberd
1.4.1 and here are my results. 

First, my changes to jabbertest: both the msgloadsnd and msgloadrec
clients are now checking for closed sockets. In addition, msgloadsnd is
watching for bounced messages. 

Okay, so I first tested my socket handling code by running jabbertest
with 5 user pairs sending 3 messages/sec for 60 seconds. Once the test
begins I manually kill jabberd. Both the msgloadsnd and msgloadrec
clients report that their sockets were closed and then abort. So that
works.

I then restart jabberd and run jabbertest with 200 user pairs sending 2
messages/sec for 60 seconds, which gives me the following stats:

UserPs Rate  Duration MinDelTime MaxDelTime AvgDelTime MsgCnt ExpMsg
MsgLossRate
200    2     60       0.01704    440.68959  151.83634  14322  24000
0.40325

That's a 40% loss rate for a 400 messages/sec test. I look in error.log
and see a lot of:

Client
...

This happens to several test_ users, not just test_76.

Ok.. so does this must mean the sockets are getting closed somewhere? I
checked both ends and none of my clients have reported a socket closed
condition. Must be something else. However, I do find a [very] few of
the following reported from msgloadsnd, which is catching bounce
messages:

[<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">dpuryear at zoloft</A> dpuryear]$ head s.test_76
msg: 7 997985807 901646 I think it is about time to say bye-bye to ICQ,
AIM, and MSN!
msg: Offline Storage
msg: Socket Error to Client
msg: Socket Error to Client
msg: 8 997985808 411677 I think it is about time to say bye-bye to ICQ,
AIM, and MSN!
msg: Offline Storage
msg: Socket Error to Client
msg: Socket Error to Client
msg: 9 997985808 921620 Are you serious? You want to do what with
Jabber?
msg: Offline Storage

I assume the &quot;int int int string&quot; messages are bounces? Regarding
&quot;Offline Storage&quot; I assume that just means jabberd is putting the
message into offline storage because it lost contact with the receiving
client, as I confirmed by looking at the test_77.xml file:

[<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">root at elavil</A> jabber-1.4.1]# ll spool/elavil/test_77.xml
-rw-------    1 jabber   jabber      15110 Aug 16 13:19
spool/elavil/test_77.xml

(Odds are receivers and evens are senders, so test_76 sends to test_77.)
But notice that I got an Offline Storage message _before_ a Socket Error
to Client message. What happened there? And why isn't my receiving
client getting a socket closed condition? None of the clients ever
report that their socket has been closed. 

Also, I don't always get warnings or notices from jabberd. For example,
examine the following:

20010816T18:24:06: [notice] (elavil): bouncing a packet to
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">test_391 at elavil</A>/Receiver from <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">test_390 at elavil</A>/Sender: Socket Error to
Client
20010816T18:24:06: [notice] (elavil): bouncing a packet to
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">test_391 at elavil</A>/Receiver from <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">test_390 at elavil</A>/Sender: Socket Error to
Client

But I have nothing in s.test_390, which contains stderr from my test_390
sending client:

[<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">dpuryear at zoloft</A> dpuryear]$ ll s.test_390
-rw-r--r--    1 dpuryear dpuryear        0 Aug 16 13:16 s.test_390

So sometimes bounces get through, and sometimes not? Not sure what is
going on.

BTW, I ran jabberd on another machine and swapped the client machines
and get similar results.

Temas, thoughts? I archived all of the data from this test, including
the jabberd log files. Let me know if you want them.

Regards, Dustin

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Well, I spoke with Colin (we are both with Vedalabs) about this and he
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; mentioned that Jabber does not guarantee delivery. Is this true? If so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; then any application that requires all messages to be delivered will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have to include some type of ACK feature.. I would think.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; bounce is happening and it is actually getting lost somehow.  It has high 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; priority in my books, but I need info, debug logs, incoming/outgoing XML for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; both parties involved, and anything else that will help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I can do this. Note however that jabberd has to be under a high load for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the problem to occur. That means you can expect _a lot_ of debug and log
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; data. Perhaps you would like to run the test suite on a personal test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; box? It may be easier for you to see what data you need? Otherwise you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; can expect a 50MB email from me. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hmm, a while ago a guy from the OSDN asked for developer access to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; testing tools. It would be nice if he could run it on his test boxes as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; well, but I'm not sure what happened to him.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The average delivery also climbs to .14 seconds, but I don't consider 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that a problem. (However, the worst case delivery times are bad: &gt; 6 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seconds for 150 and 160 user pairs.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We've just developed a project (client+server) for one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; biggest ISP in Italy. We found since the beginning that each 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jabber server was not able to handle more than a couple hundreds 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; client, so we implemented an architecture that load balances the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; traffic among many concurrent servers running on the same or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different hosts. We also encountered message losses, but we didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; care much :-). As Dustin, we thought this was due to client 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, now that I know someone else has had a similar experience I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only assume the problem is with jabberd. I had hoped that jabber.org
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would confirm this to either be a problem or something they had built
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into jabberd, but that information hasn't been very forthcoming.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the end I suppose developers using jabberd need to realize that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only works in low to medium load environments where message delivery is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not a big issue. Unfortunately, I am not sure if the same is true of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jabber.com server since they didn't present any information on this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; topic either.
