I skimmed through the code; I'm totally unfamiliar with the server 
implementation but I got the gist of it. It definitely seems that the 
mod_xml_get function, which handles the &quot;get&quot; requests, intercepts ALL 
non-&quot;jabber:&quot; namespaces and ALWAYS returns the stored XML (or an empty 
result if nothing is stored). In other words, live client-to-client 
&quot;get&quot; requests are effectively impossible, since the server will eat 
them all. The only way around this is to make up a new namespace in the 
&quot;jabber:&quot; domain, which is of course a Bad Idea.

So isn't this kind of a monkey wrench in the whole Jabber extensibility 
story? The functionality of IQ queries has been greatly reduced by 
this -- now, to define a new query type you have to hack the server to 
get around mod_xml, otherwise the clients won't be able to talk to each 
other.

mod_xml looks like a really poorly thought-out idea. It would have been 
great had it reserved some particular namespace and only handled queries 
in children of that, but by eating the entire namespace universe apart 
from &quot;jabber:&quot;, it leaves no room for anything else.

(Or have I managed to completely misunderstand those few pages of C 
code?)
