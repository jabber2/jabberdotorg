<PRE>Having a self signed cert on the client and server is not only possible,
but perhaps the only way that you can avoid having your cert. subverted.

1) pin self signed cert, or your own certificate chain onto the client
application (i.e. make it part of the installable package, include it as an
asset)

2) When application is starting, create your own TrustStore with ONLY your
certificate as trusted.  Create your SSLContext or SSLSocketFactory from
this.  Be sure that your KeyStore / TrustStore ONLY has your certificates,
add them specifically and do not add the generic ones on the device, as
they may be compromised.

3) For Android devices, I used &amp; recommend &quot;SpongyCastle&quot;, as it fixes the
broken elements of the included &quot;BouncyCastle&quot; crypto libraries.

3) Add self signed cert to the server, and instruct it load this.

Now your client XMPP application ONLY trusts &amp; can be decrypted by the
server that you've configured it to communicate with, and all the
communications are safe from eavesdropping.

With only your certificate, there's no way anyone can get the issuer to add
another compromised certificate without you knowing (i.e. NSL to your
'budget certificate provider', forcing them to assist L.E.).  You are in
control of the entire chain, you just need to supply them to the clients or
other servers you'd like to communicate with.
