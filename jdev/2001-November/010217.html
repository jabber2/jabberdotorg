<PRE>Gonna try to make this quick, 'cause I gotta get to work.

I'd like to see jabberd fixed up to run as a proper daemon.  jabberd 
should fork once the config file's read in (unless told explicitly not to, 
like apache's -X).

There should be a proper install mechanism that puts jabberd in /usr/sbin, 
all the .so's in /usr/lib/jabber, the spool in /var/spool/jabber, config 
in /etc/jabber and log files in /var/log/jabber (all what I'm used to with 
RedHat).

I've built my RPM (which I will clean up and make available) to put the
files in those places, and it works, but it does complain about not being
able to find the directory it was compiled in.  Not forking makes it more 
difficult to write a RH-compliant init.d script.  It would also be nice to 
have jabberd run as a non-root user; there's no need for it to run as 
root, and if (God forbid) an exploit was found to exist, this would save 
some headache.

Has anyone already looked into doing these things?  I *might* have some 
time over the long weekend to hack on this a bit if I know where to start.  
I guess another appropriate question would be &quot;why hasn't this been done 
already?&quot;  If there are valid reasons, I'll save myself some coding time, 
but otherwise, I should be able to dive in and give it a whirl.
