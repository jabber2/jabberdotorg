&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I can understand the idea which you are proposing, but it looks to me
</I>&gt;<i> that it would be best inplemented
</I>&gt;<i> on the client side, rather than server side. Let me explain:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   In the example, it was shown that different jabber servers have
</I>&gt;<i> different transport addresses, well the
</I>&gt;<i> situation is more complex than that. There is little to stop me from
</I>&gt;<i> registering with the msn.jabber.com
</I>&gt;<i> transport from jabber.org. In that case, the msn.jabber.com address
</I>&gt;<i> would work and the msn.jabber.org
</I>&gt;<i> would not. In fact, this flexability has proven most useful in the whole
</I>&gt;<i> AOL affair, meaning that a jabber
</I>&gt;<i> user can try and find a transport on another server which will work for
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   With this in mind, it wouldn't be difficult for the client software
</I>&gt;<i> translate the suggested scheme into the
</I>&gt;<i> transport the user had registered with. I.e. msn:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">test at hotmail.com</A> =&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> test%<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">hotmail.com at registered.transport</A>
</I>
Yes but to make sure it works with all clients it should really be a server
side thing, but thats a definate point that there needs to be a way to pick
which transport server you wish to use.

Now what about this, because the transport itself is already a part of the
roster the server will know which one you are using and can translate the
address itself, this also allows you to change transport servers by just
deleting the existing one from your roster and subscribing to another all
without having to rebuild your roster items that were on the old transport
server, the jabber server will just redirect the xml packets to the new
server automatically.

&gt;<i>   Extending this further, it could be made to popup a registration
</I>&gt;<i> window to the nearest transport if you call
</I>&gt;<i> a transport which you are nor registered to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Another possibility would be allowing the user to register to the same
</I>&gt;<i> transport on different servers, and
</I>&gt;<i> the client keeps the rosters in sync. The generic address will then
</I>&gt;<i> chose the best transport and send through
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
Would not work for AIM or MSN tho as as soon as you logged in another
session it would auto logout any previous ones.

&gt;<i> Just a few ideas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> David
