<PRE>discussed:

a GPL Jabber Server
P2P Conference
Identity

[14:05] * theo has changed the topic to: The DotGNU-Jabber Meeting
[14:06] &lt;theo&gt; ok, while mike gets over,
[14:07] &lt;theo&gt; i want to say hello, everyone!
[14:07] &lt;theo&gt; and sorry for accidentally planning this on Thanksgiving, 
for all you fellow americans out there  :)
[14:08] &lt;theo&gt; um,
[14:08] &lt;theo&gt; hello?
[14:08] &lt;jan&gt; hi adam, hi everyone else!
[14:08] &lt;theo&gt; ok, good,
[14:09] &lt;nb&gt; Hi Jan, hi theo, hi karjala
[14:09] &lt;theo&gt; i was starting to worry i was in the twilight zone here  :)
[14:09] &lt;karjala&gt; hi
[14:09] &lt;theo&gt; ok, first item: &quot;a GPL'ed Jabber Server&quot;
[14:10] * theo has changed the topic to: GPL'ed Jabber Server
[14:10] &lt;theo&gt; 
<A HREF="http://subscribe.dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2001-November/001430.html">http://subscribe.dotgnu.org/pipermail/developers/2001-November/001430.html</A>
[14:10] &lt;theo&gt; that's a link to a post i made a few hours ago,
[14:10] &lt;theo&gt; about my discovery of how a GPL'ed Jabber Server exists 
already.
[14:11] &lt;nb&gt; This is very good news.
[14:11] &lt;theo&gt; it seems that up until v1.1.3 of the open source server, 
it was GPL'ed.
[14:11] %% mike has joined
[14:11] &lt;theo&gt; then starting with v1.2 it was completely relicensed to 
the new JOSL.
[14:11] &lt;theo&gt; hi, mike!
[14:12] &lt;theo&gt; glad you could make it.
[14:12] &lt;mike&gt; heya
[14:12] &lt;mike&gt; yeah. It seems that the jabber.org &lt;&gt; theoretic.com link 
isn't 100% right now. Or it might be my connection
[14:12] &lt;theo&gt; nb: what are your thoughts on this discovery?
[14:12] &lt;mike&gt; Anyway, one q - why is a GPLed Jabber server necessary?
[14:12] &lt;theo&gt; no, i'm having s2s problems with jabber.org, too.
[14:13] &lt;mike&gt; ok. is it the DNS propagation?
[14:13] &lt;theo&gt; mike: because dotGNU would want to run their own Jabber 
implimentations, as part of dotGNU.
[14:13] &lt;nb&gt; mike: Why we need a GPLed Jabber server...
[14:13] &lt;theo&gt; this could only be done in the GPL.
[14:13] &lt;nb&gt; Three reasons:
[14:14] &lt;theo&gt; mike: nope, DNS is done. it's just seems to be another 
jabber.org glitch.
[14:14] &lt;nb&gt; 1) People want an IM system as part of DotGNU...
[14:14] &lt;nb&gt; this means among other things that we must be able to 
integrate a server for whatever IM system we use into the webservices 
server stuff...
[14:15] &lt;nb&gt; This won't work if our stuff is GPL'd and the server has a 
GPL-incompatible license.
[14:16] &lt;nb&gt; 2) Jabber has also been proposed as a protocol that DotGNU 
could use for other things (IM communication between pieces of software)...
[14:16] &lt;nb&gt; Especially the JAM stuff, and the Jabber p2p ideas seem 
suitable for this purpose...
[14:16] &lt;theo&gt; yep.
[14:17] &lt;theo&gt; i'm particularly interested in the JAM aspect.
[14:17] &lt;nb&gt; HOWEVER we cannot for reasons of priciple adopt a family of 
protocols where we would essentially provide momentum to a 
non-GPL-compatible project.
[14:18] &lt;mike&gt; is that still alive? What's the major difference between 
JOSL and GPL then?
[14:18] &lt;theo&gt; JOSL is mozilla-based.
[14:18] &lt;theo&gt; it is not compatible with the GPL, meaning code cannot be 
forked over to the GPL.
[14:19] &lt;nb&gt; 3) If it's true that Jabber,Inc took a GPL'd technology, 
bought it out by hiring the developers, and changed the licensing so 
that they would have some hooks on it, then what they've don eis just 
plain wrong / unethical, and it wouldn't be right to go along with it.
[14:19] &lt;theo&gt; nb: by &quot;providing momentum to a non-GPL-compatible 
project&quot;, you mean just not using the JOSL'ed Jabber server, right?
[14:19] &lt;nb&gt; Yes...
[14:19] &lt;mike&gt; well presumably the developers consented to that 
licensing change, yes?
[14:20] &lt;theo&gt; yes.
[14:20] &lt;theo&gt; they would have to.
[14:20] &lt;nb&gt; mike: But people who contributed with stuff like bug 
reports etc weren't asked.
[14:20] &lt;theo&gt; the JOSL is a very nice license.
[14:21] &lt;theo&gt; i met many people at the p2p conf that were using the 
JOSL license in non-jabber projects.
[14:21] &lt;nb&gt; theo: If DotGNU uses Jabber internally (not just as an IM 
system)...
[14:21] &lt;theo&gt; nb: yes, probably so. it was just assumed that bug 
reporters with patches handed over their copyrights.
[14:21] &lt;theo&gt; although,
[14:22] &lt;theo&gt; to be fair, i don't think there were many, or even any, 
of those in the early jabber server.
[14:22] &lt;theo&gt; from what i've seen, the entire codebase was done by the 
early core team.
[14:22] &lt;nb&gt; then that will add a lot of momentum that to the JAM and 
p2p parts of Jabber.
[14:23] &lt;theo&gt; nb: yep, i agree.it will finally get the JAM started again.
[14:23] &lt;nb&gt; which is a good thing probably...
[14:23] &lt;nb&gt; :-)
[14:23] &lt;theo&gt; nb: would you want to takle the 1.1.3 codebase?
[14:23] &lt;theo&gt; or hold out and try to get the 5 or so copyright holders 
to re-GPL it?
[14:23] &lt;mike&gt; it might be worth reimplementing the server in java if 
you're going to do that
[14:23] &lt;nb&gt; but DotGNU will work only with things that 
&quot;proprietary-thinking&quot; companies don't have hooks on.
[14:24] &lt;mike&gt; And perhaps it's worth considering why they changed the 
license : presumably the GPL wasn't suitable for their needs
[14:24] &lt;theo&gt; nb: how so?
[14:24] &lt;theo&gt; mike: well, yes, for their needs. i don't think we are 
saying they were wrong.
[14:25] &lt;theo&gt; they did what they felt they needed to.
[14:25] &lt;theo&gt; what's important right now is dotGNU needs GPL'ed code, 
and there exists (albeit old) GPL'ed code.
[14:25] &lt;mike&gt; ok
[14:25] &lt;nb&gt; For some reason, they thought (maybe still think) that a 
GPL-compatibel license will not meet their needs.
[14:26] &lt;theo&gt; so nb, think that dotGNU could use the 1.1.3 line?
[14:26] &lt;nb&gt; Yes.
[14:26] &lt;theo&gt; i'll get the post explaining the 1.0 landmark.
[14:26] &lt;theo&gt; <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/?oid=6">http://www.jabber.org/?oid=6</A>
[14:26] &lt;theo&gt; that's announcing server 1.0.
[14:26] &lt;nb&gt; My intuition (which is often right and sometimes wrong:) 
says that they won't truly want to coopertae with us.
[14:27] &lt;theo&gt; yes, quite possibly. unfortunate, but likely.
[14:27] &lt;nb&gt; In this case the way to go is to start from 1.1.3 and fork 
from there.
[14:27] &lt;theo&gt; yep.
[14:27] &lt;theo&gt; ok, so that established.
[14:27] &lt;mike&gt; possibly
[14:28] &lt;mike&gt; bear in mind that that line is UNIX only
[14:28] &lt;mike&gt; is that a problem
[14:28] &lt;theo&gt; a nifty new name for this 1.1.3 fork?
[14:28] &lt;theo&gt; no.
[14:28] &lt;theo&gt; shouldn't be at this early stage.
[14:28] &lt;mike&gt; ok
[14:28] &lt;nb&gt; I propose you informally check with the copyright holder if 
they're interested incooperating with us.
[14:28] &lt;nb&gt; If they're not interested, don't go into long negotiations, 
but fork.
[14:29] &lt;theo&gt; nb suggested &quot;DotJab&quot; as a name for this fork,
[14:29] &lt;theo&gt; yep.
[14:29] &lt;theo&gt; i agree, nb.
[14:29] &lt;nb&gt; mike: Actually it's enough for us if the server-side stuff 
works on GNU systems (GNU/Linux, GNU/HUrd) and they're close enough to Unix.
[14:30] &lt;mike&gt; sorry guys, got to go eat
[14:30] &lt;mike&gt; later
[14:30] &lt;mike&gt; i don't think i can contribute much at the moment anyway
[14:30] %% mike has left
[14:30] &lt;theo&gt; mike: ok, talk to you soon, i hope.
[14:30] &lt;theo&gt; nb: ok.
[14:30] &lt;theo&gt; sounds good.
[14:31] &lt;theo&gt; i'll jabber Jer real quick to ask him,
[14:31] &lt;theo&gt; and try and catch temas and dizzyd soon, too.
[14:31] &lt;nb&gt; Good idea... invite them to come over :-)
[14:31] &lt;theo&gt; oh, none of them are online right now.
[14:32] &lt;theo&gt; prolly all celebrating thanksgiving.
[14:32] &lt;nb&gt; Understandable.
[14:32] &lt;theo&gt; oh, wait.
[14:32] &lt;theo&gt; hold on.
[14:32] &lt;nb&gt; So I suggest we invite them to the next meeting.
[14:32] &lt;nb&gt; If they don't come, we have our answer :-)
[14:33] &lt;karjala&gt; Who is mike?
[14:33] &lt;karjala&gt; I mean, what's his relation to the jabber team?
[14:34] &lt;theo&gt; mike is the main developer of Jabber Identity.
[14:34] &lt;karjala&gt; I didn't catch that from the context of this discussion.
[14:34] &lt;nb&gt; He's the primary developer of the (GPL'd) Jabber auth project.
[14:35] &lt;theo&gt; yep, the two of us are developing a complete Identity 
system for Jabber.
[14:35] &lt;theo&gt; ok, so that's established (GPL).
[14:36] %% mass has joined
[14:36] &lt;theo&gt; and i assume you are interested inJabber for instant xml 
routing, right?
[14:36] &lt;theo&gt; hi, mass.
[14:36] &lt;karjala&gt; theo: who is 'you'?
[14:36] &lt;nb&gt; Me :-)
[14:36] &lt;theo&gt; mass is a jabber developer.
[14:36] &lt;mass&gt; heya :-)
[14:36] &lt;theo&gt; &quot;you&quot; was actually meant broader  :)
[14:37] &lt;theo&gt; you in the 2nd person plural  :)
[14:37] * mass has missed quite a few dotgnu/jabber meetings now
[14:37] &lt;theo&gt; hehe, that's fine.
[14:37] &lt;theo&gt; we just finished talking about GPL'ing the Jabber server.
[14:38] &lt;mass&gt; ahh
[14:38] &lt;theo&gt; mass, did you know the JOSS was once GPL'ed? up till the 
1.1.3 line.
[14:38] &lt;theo&gt; i was shocked when i found out.
[14:38] &lt;mass&gt; yeah, you didn't? :-)
[14:38] &lt;theo&gt; always thought it was JOSL'ed the entire time.
[14:38] &lt;mass&gt; I remember when the license changed
[14:38] &lt;mass&gt; I've been with jabber since.. I think 99
[14:38] &lt;theo&gt; so it looks like dotGNU will be doing a fork of the 1.1.3 
line.
[14:38] &lt;mass&gt; either august of 99 or 98
[14:38] &lt;theo&gt; wow.
[14:39] &lt;theo&gt; from the beginning, pretty much.
[14:39] &lt;mass&gt; yep
[14:39] &lt;nb&gt; Mass: Are you one of the copyright holders of JOSS?
[14:39] &lt;mass&gt; about four months before the 0.7 server came out, which 
switched to pretty much what is the current protocol
[14:39] &lt;mass&gt; nah; I wrote jabberbeans
[14:39] &lt;theo&gt; oh, so the protocol implimented in the 1.1.3 line is the 
same as 1.4?
[14:40] &lt;mass&gt; well
[14:40] &lt;mass&gt; more or less
[14:40] &lt;theo&gt; ah, ok.
[14:40] &lt;theo&gt; minor changes.
[14:40] &lt;theo&gt; gotcha.
[14:40] &lt;mass&gt; probably less :-)
[14:40] &lt;theo&gt; ah, ok.
[14:40] &lt;mass&gt; 1.4 had some IO changes, that was the big thing
[14:40] &lt;theo&gt; IO?
[14:40] &lt;mass&gt; the goal was to make the server a good framework for 
writing components
[14:40] &lt;theo&gt; as in c2s, s2s?
[14:41] &lt;mass&gt; and things like transports and yeah, c2s and s2s need to 
handle lots of sockets
[14:41] &lt;theo&gt; ah, ok.
[14:41] &lt;mass&gt; so the idea was that you can create all these components 
as building blocks
[14:41] &lt;mass&gt; and run them all within one process, or in separate processes
[14:42] &lt;nb&gt; We're building something like this in DotGNU anyway.
[14:42] &lt;nb&gt; So we could just use that stuff...
[14:42] &lt;mass&gt; also everything within the docs.jabber.org 'draft 
protocol' section which requires server code was implemented in 1.4
[14:42] &lt;theo&gt; ah, ok.
[14:42] &lt;mass&gt; I would of course recommend trying to get the right 
people in the right place and see if the server can be dual-licensed, 
rather than (basically) forked
[14:43] &lt;theo&gt; yes, going to try that first.
[14:43] %% mike has joined
[14:43] &lt;mass&gt; that would by far be the best for everyone
[14:43] &lt;theo&gt; yep.
[14:43] &lt;nb&gt; Yes...
[14:43] &lt;theo&gt; hi, mike
[14:43] &lt;theo&gt; ok, thanks mass.
[14:44] &lt;mike&gt; heya
[14:44] &lt;theo&gt; well,
[14:44] &lt;nb&gt; I heard from Bradley Kuhn (VP FSF) that he and RMS have 
already tried talking with them about this...
[14:44] &lt;theo&gt; that concludes the GPL topic, i guess :)
[14:44] &lt;theo&gt; nb: eh?
[14:44] &lt;mass&gt; ahh really?
[14:44] &lt;theo&gt; nb: talking to them about what?
[14:44] &lt;nb&gt; it may take a real threat of a fork to get them to change 
their mind :-)
[14:45] &lt;theo&gt; oh, interesting...
[14:45] &lt;theo&gt; didn't know that.
[14:45] &lt;theo&gt; wow, that's interesting. thanks norbert.
[14:47] &lt;mike&gt; ping
[14:47] * theo has changed the topic to: O'Reilly P2P Conference Report
[14:47] &lt;mike&gt; still here then
[14:47] &lt;mike&gt; ok cool
[14:47] &lt;theo&gt; alrighty.
[14:47] &lt;theo&gt; as many of you know, i attended the P2P conference,
[14:47] &lt;mass&gt; (lucky bastard ;-) )
[14:47] &lt;theo&gt; sponsored by IMissary &lt;www.imissary.com&gt;
[14:48] &lt;theo&gt; IMissary is Heg's new start-up,
[14:48] &lt;theo&gt; to develop and sell jabber products, as well as jabber 
consulting.
[14:48] &lt;theo&gt; he was gracious enough to provide money for room and 
board up there.
[14:48] &lt;theo&gt; there was alot of talk about Jabber,
[14:48] &lt;theo&gt; after i brought the topic up.
[14:49] &lt;theo&gt; and even heard dotGNU come up a couple of times.
[14:49] &lt;nb&gt; Is imissary a Free Software company?
[14:49] &lt;nb&gt; (Their website doesn't seem to work)
[14:50] &lt;theo&gt; on dotGNU, i think there was a panel talking about 
Identity Services and the Liberty Alliance that mentioned it as a viable 
alternative to dotNET.
[14:50] &lt;theo&gt; nb: no, it isn't. it's commercial.
[14:50] &lt;mass&gt; website worked ok here
[14:51] &lt;theo&gt; and i brought it up in my Identity Services speach.
[14:52] &lt;theo&gt; overall, alot of focus went to .NET.
[14:52] &lt;theo&gt; *alot*
[14:52] &lt;mike&gt; no surprises there
[14:52] &lt;theo&gt; from the atmosphere of the conference, alot of people are 
considering .NET as a viable platform to adopt.
[14:52] &lt;mass&gt; *grin* I still haven't quite figured out what microsoft 
thinks .Net is
[14:52] &lt;theo&gt; this is mainly to do with 2 things, IMO:
[14:52] &lt;mike&gt; lol. They have a definition somewhere
[14:53] &lt;theo&gt; the &quot;gloss&quot; that Microsoft has surrounded .NET with.
[14:53] &lt;nb&gt; mass: The difnition is changing all the time... .NET is 
simply about catching everyone in a .NET and locking them in.
[14:53] &lt;theo&gt; all the presentations about .NET portrayed it as a this 
bold, innovative new thing that was *clean and simple*.
[14:54] &lt;theo&gt; that is what seemed to be the theme MS used. *clean and 
simple*.
[14:54] &lt;theo&gt; thought that might be of interest to dotGNU.
[14:54] &lt;mike&gt; and i have to admit - it is
[14:55] &lt;theo&gt; and that dotGNU could do the same by adopting a clean and 
simple [platform, Jabber, for an underlaying protocol.
[14:55] &lt;nb&gt; Were those MS representative speaking, or independant 
companies?
[14:55] &lt;theo&gt; mike: it is? yeah, i havn't had a chance to look into it 
much.
[14:55] &lt;mike&gt; The programming model is
[14:55] &lt;mike&gt; HailStorm is something different
[14:55] &lt;theo&gt; MS reps were everywhere, but those were speakers.
[14:55] &lt;theo&gt; mike: ah, ok, i see.
[14:55] &lt;theo&gt; one thing:
[14:56] &lt;theo&gt; .NET is fully using http to route.
[14:56] &lt;theo&gt; dotGNU could do better in the realm of power, 
flexability, and security by using Jabber.
[14:56] &lt;mike&gt; not true
[14:56] &lt;mike&gt; they have developed something called DIME
[14:56] &lt;theo&gt; just thought i'd plug this again :)
[14:56] &lt;theo&gt; DIME? never heard of it....?
[14:56] &lt;mike&gt; it's like a lightweight Jabber, but without all the s2s 
routing etc.
[14:56] &lt;theo&gt; oh, huh....
[14:57] &lt;theo&gt; can it be found anywhere?
[14:57] &lt;mike&gt; no, it's still pretty new. Direct Internet Message 
Encapsulation i think
[14:57] &lt;theo&gt; oh, ok...
[14:57] &lt;theo&gt; sounds interesting.
[14:57] &lt;theo&gt; i'll try to look into it.
[14:57] &lt;nb&gt; Actually DotGNU wants the s2s routing.
[14:57] &lt;theo&gt; hm...
[14:58] &lt;nb&gt; We want dollars, not just dimes :-)
[14:58] &lt;theo&gt; is it just me, or do others see potential battle lines 
being drawn in technology between these different groups?
[14:58] &lt;mike&gt; hehe. Not really
[14:58] &lt;theo&gt; i mean, the Free and Open world potentiall using Jabber,
[14:58] &lt;theo&gt; .NET &amp; other proprietary companies using DIME,
[14:58] &lt;theo&gt; and AOL will whip something out, i'm sure...
[14:59] &lt;nb&gt; AOL hates MS so much...
[14:59] &lt;theo&gt; ah, well. just me  :)
[14:59] &lt;mike&gt; DIME will probably be an open protocol, or basically open.
[14:59] &lt;theo&gt; nb: yep. they will never use .NET.
[14:59] &lt;nb&gt; that we actually have a chance to get them supporting our 
standards.
[15:00] &lt;theo&gt; nb: maybe... but i think AOL sees itself as the &quot;real&quot; 
internet, and will do their own thing, but ultimately blunder it.
[15:00] &lt;mike&gt; hmmmm, doubt it. maybe though. knowing aol they'd rather 
die than use something that wasn't developed by them
[15:00] &lt;theo&gt; yep.
[15:00] &lt;nb&gt; The trick is that we need to get the banks on our side first.
[15:00] &lt;theo&gt; yes, true.
[15:00] &lt;nb&gt; Everyone wants to be able to process payments :-)
[15:00] &lt;theo&gt; ok, any questions about the p2p conf?
[15:01] &lt;mike&gt; banks?
[15:01] &lt;mike&gt; ah yes, i see
[15:01] &lt;theo&gt; mike: yeah, secure, safe transactions.
[15:01] &lt;theo&gt; i've read that many banks that are tech-savvy are 
skeptical of .NET's security.
[15:01] &lt;nb&gt; The banks hate Microsft, too.  That&#228;'s our big opportunity.
[15:01] &lt;theo&gt; yep.
[15:02] * theo has changed the topic to: Identity
[15:02] &lt;theo&gt; ok, mike, have any updates on Jabber Identity/Genio?
[15:02] &lt;theo&gt; Genio, btw, is the new name for the system, while Jabber 
Identity is the jabber-specific implimentation.
[15:03] &lt;mike&gt; not really. I've been redesigning it a bit lately, and 
getting the hang of Java, as I'm planning on reimplementing it in Java 
using servlets/APACHE SOAP
[15:03] &lt;theo&gt; ah, ok...
[15:03] &lt;mike&gt; Yeah. Genio is the system. Jenio is the jabber based 
implementation. Or at least, that's current thinking
[15:03] &lt;mike&gt; i'm redesigning that oo
[15:03] &lt;theo&gt; ok, cool.
[15:03] &lt;nb&gt; Do you have a website up yes for Genio?  Released code?
[15:04] &lt;blalor&gt; or a quick overview of what Genio is?
[15:04] &lt;mike&gt; this is all subject to change without notice of course :)
[15:04] &lt;mike&gt; almost
[15:04] &lt;mike&gt; it's coming soon
[15:04] &lt;mike&gt; for now, www.theoretic.com/identity
[15:04] &lt;theo&gt; right now it's just at Theoretic
[15:05] &lt;theo&gt; oh,
[15:05] &lt;theo&gt; and i'm going to try and get into the Liberty Alliance, 
and pitch Genio to them as a solution.
[15:05] &lt;theo&gt; they are looking for something, i hear.
[15:06] &lt;theo&gt; and Genio fits everything they need.
[15:06] &lt;mike&gt; Right. We are hopeful about that
[15:06] &lt;blalor&gt; I'm a little confused; how would something like Genio 
work across messaging platforms?
[15:06] &lt;blalor&gt; jabber s2s is great for a distributed network of 
servers, but what about something that's on a different network?
[15:07] &lt;mike&gt; Genio and Messaging is still being designed. Basically I 
see it one of the web services you can associate with offering platform 
independant access to messaging networks
[15:07] &lt;theo&gt; Genio is not language-specific.
[15:07] &lt;mike&gt; So you can use Jabber as the messaging system if you 
want, or else use a different method of sending messages/notifications etc
[15:07] &lt;theo&gt; it just really defines what components are needed in a 
Genio system,
[15:07] &lt;blalor&gt; I think a big-picture overview with lots of little 
pictures and arrows is much needed
[15:07] &lt;theo&gt; and lets the various programming languages and platforms 
do that how they can.
[15:08] &lt;mike&gt; Or platform specific
[15:08] &lt;theo&gt; yep, we're working on that.
[15:08] &lt;theo&gt; i'll be doing the big picture stuff, probably.
[15:08] &lt;mike&gt; It's coming! Don't worry- problem is right now the big 
picture keeps changing, and the little arrow keep moving
[15:08] &lt;theo&gt; hehe.
[15:08] &lt;nb&gt; :-)
[15:09] &lt;theo&gt; ok, i think that wraps this up.
[15:09] &lt;theo&gt; is there anything else real quick?
[15:10] &lt;theo&gt; ok, that's it.
[15:10] &lt;theo&gt; thank you everyone,
[15:10] &lt;theo&gt; i'll put some stuff together and see if there is need for 
another meeting next week.
