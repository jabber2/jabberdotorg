<PRE>Hello,

  I can understand the idea which you are proposing, but it looks to me 
that it would be best inplemented
on the client side, rather than server side. Let me explain:

  In the example, it was shown that different jabber servers have 
different transport addresses, well the
situation is more complex than that. There is little to stop me from 
registering with the msn.jabber.com
transport from jabber.org. In that case, the msn.jabber.com address 
would work and the msn.jabber.org
would not. In fact, this flexability has proven most useful in the whole 
AOL affair, meaning that a jabber
user can try and find a transport on another server which will work for 
them.

  With this in mind, it wouldn't be difficult for the client software 
translate the suggested scheme into the
transport the user had registered with. I.e. msn:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">test at hotmail.com</A> =&gt; 
test%<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">hotmail.com at registered.transport</A>

  Extending this further, it could be made to popup a registration 
window to the nearest transport if you call
a transport which you are nor registered to.

  Another possibility would be allowing the user to register to the same 
transport on different servers, and
the client keeps the rosters in sync. The generic address will then 
chose the best transport and send through
that.

Just a few ideas.
