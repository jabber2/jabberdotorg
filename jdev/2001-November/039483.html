<PRE>I am totally against any sort of advertising such as this. Even though I 
want to get the word out about Jabber I don't think this is the right 
way. If you are chatting with those people anyways, just mention Jabber 
to them yourself. If I were not using Jabber and received this message I 
would be extremely annoyed and would likely never try Jabber, but that's 
just me.

Another point is that having any sort of static or repetative string of 
text in messages to the networks we are trying to interoperate with, we 
are providing them with a fingerprint with which they can block us with. 
All they have to do is detect messages that contain that string and they 
can easily drop that message or disconnect you from the server, 
rendering your transport useless.

I want more people to use Jabber as much as anyone, but forcing our 
message onto people who may not want it or even care about it is a bad 
idea.

</I>&gt;<i> Jabber people who are in a position to do something
</I>&gt;<i> about this. Here's a short summary of the message:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By attaching a message to each stream going to other
</I>&gt;<i> networks (ICQ, MSN, Yahoo...) Jabber can promote
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability and itself. This capability is unique

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think? What's good about it? What's bad
</I>&gt;<i> about it? Alternatives?
</I>&gt;<i> If you think this is a good idea I'd be glad if you
