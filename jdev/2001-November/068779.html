<PRE>Hi again and thanks for the response. Really good
points you all and I admit one reason I wrote was to
stir up the Jabber kettle a bit:-)  The Advocacy JIG
is a great idea.


&quot;If you are chatting with those people anyways, just
mention Jabber to them yourself.&quot;

I agree that's the proper way to spread Jabber but...
I've noticed that when I do this people tend to get
really excited only to be disappointed by how much
registration and installation stuff they have to get
through to get the whole thing working. And then the
gateway they're trying to use go down and they don't
know why (they can't even find out if the gateway is
down or what's causing the problems) and they don't
know what to do. This makes people return to where
they came from:-(
Transport registration, installation and support
definitely needs to be optimized.



&quot;One simple suggestion would be to say start showing
small ads on sites that Open Source folks frequent
(like O'Reilly sites, Slashdot, Freshmeat etc). With
the help of people like Tim O'Reilly, Craig Burton,
Dave Winer, Doc Searls etc (all Jabber enthusiasts), I
am sure we can start getting the word around and
become more noticeable. My 0.02 paise.&quot;

Why don't we make a &quot;Download Jabber now!&quot; sticker
that anyone can put on their site and that leads
directly to a download/registration page.


Looking forward to attending Advocacy meetings:-)

Rikard
