<PRE>So I just wanted to keep everyone in the loop here is the current list
of features I have had requested from people, feel free to send more:

- Bug Tracking
- CVS
- Webspace
- Mailing Lists
- NNTP msg boards with web interface
- Links to Text Conferencing Channels
- Ability to message developers from sites
- Journals
- Placeholder account that merely has information and goes to another
  location
- Wishlists
- Presence enable the site for user names and other pieces
- User Levels (example:  non developers would only get a simple bug query
  and submit form)
- Cohesive news posting, so items can easily be marked global
- Document Manager

We've decided on a 3 user level system for the implementation: User,
Developer and Admin.  Each level of access includes the ones below it,
so a Developer can do everything a User can, and an Admin can do
everything.  The current breakdown of user abilities is:

Admin
-----
    * Edit project info
    * Access control
    * Website control through cvs

Developer
---------
    * CVS (Commit)
    * News (Post Site, Post Global, Post NNTP)
    * Bug Tacking (Resolution, Modify Values)
    * Doc Manager (Update, Create, CheckOut)
    * Wishlist (Remove)

User
----
    * CVS (Checkout)
    * News (Read)
    * Wishlist (Add)
    * Bug Tracking (Open, Query, Append Info)
    * Doc Manager (Read, UserComments, Wishlist)

As you can see a few of the features are not listed in the abilities,
this generally means that anyone can do/use it, or there is a question
about it.

The current questions I would like to ask everyone for feedback on are:

- Do we want mailing lists?  We can gateway mailing lists with the news
  server fine, but it's still a semi clunky interface.  If we had just
  the news servers is that enough?  Maybe just announce mailing lists
  which are all gatewayed to one announce group?  We could also keep
  both completely seperate, but that would be odd because you would have
  to pick one are to communicate through.  One thing to keep in mind is
  that gatewaying between the news and mailing lists can only happen as
  often as it's setup to do in cron.  I've tested it with a small load
  on my box with a run every 5 minutes, and sometimes it feels a bit odd
  because whole test conversations can happen on the news server before
  they hit the list.  Some input would be helpful.

- How far do we want to take Journals?  We were pondering just using the
  jogger for independent journals and then a project jog for development
  updates.

- Do news posting need comments other than a cross post onto the NNTP
  news server?  I think having the option to post onto the NNTP server
  as well as the site (which would then create a link to participate in
  the discussion) would be sufficient, but I want to make sure no one
  else feels strongly otherwise.


So there you have it.  Feel free to fire away answers, or any other
questions you have about where we are.
