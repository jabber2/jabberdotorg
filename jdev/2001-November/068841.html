connection doesn't die properly when I logout as jabberd is holding the
tty open.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>   I'd second (or was that third) the idea that jabber should have a
decent build process. Likewise, the .so files should all go in a single
directory. The current approach is difficult from a system
administration perspective.

&gt;<i> I've built my RPM (which I will clean up and make available) to put the

   Easy fix (for jabber-1.4.1 anyway). In &quot;configure&quot; change

&quot;JHOME=`pwd`&quot;
to
&quot;JHOME=/usr/local/whatever&quot;

   But again, it shows that the build process is broken.

   A temporary hack would be to use:

if [ -z &quot;$JHOME&quot; ]; then
    &quot;JHOME=`pwd`&quot;
fi

or

if [ ! -d &quot;$JHOME&quot; ]; then
    &quot;JHOME=`pwd`&quot;
fi

&gt;<i> difficult to write a RH-compliant init.d script.  It would also be nice to

</I>&gt;<i> root, and if (God forbid) an exploit was found to exist, this would save

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>   There is no need to run jabber as a root user as it listens on port
5222. Unless you run other extensions which I don't.

   However, what I'd like to add is an ability for root to run jabber
chroot'ed as a normal user. Like named's -u and -t options. The best
I've got now is a normal user in a non-chroot environment. However, if
jabber gets breached, an attacker could get a user shell-account. If
jabber runs as nobody in a chroot however...

   And while I admire the abilities of the jabber developers, we *know*
there are holes in jabber -- right?. Any program this big and a network
daemon at that -- it's just a matter of time.

&gt;<i> Has anyone already looked into doing these things?  I *might* have some

</I>&gt;<i> but otherwise, I should be able to dive in and give it a whirl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>   I'll like to work on something similar. But I'd like to know whose's
code I'm stepping on. In all probability, there are very good reasons
why things are being done as they are now. However, I do believe the
code is too complex to audit from a security perspective. While jabber
works after a fashion, there are many features/safeguards which I'd
like for peace-of-mind.

For example:
- simplified command-line parsing. Is there really a need to allow
  sysadmin to add command-line parameters by changing the configuration
  file? Does that mean jabberd will never have a proper man page? Why
  not just use getopt(). The current jabber also allows for command lines
  like &quot;jabber -a -b&quot; to be interpreted as &quot;jabber -a \-b&quot;. While this is
  explained in the FAQ, it is counter-intuitive and the opposite of other
  programs.
- add chroot() support.
- add setuid()/setgid() support.

   I believe I can most of the stuffs. However, like Brian, I'd like to
hear reasons why I shouldn't dive in and start coding. Furthermore,
would a decent patch implementing the above ideas be applied?

Thanks

Eddie
