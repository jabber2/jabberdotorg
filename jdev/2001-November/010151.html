</I>Sorry, let me be a little clearer. There are three versions of IRC-t,
although there are only two versions which work. 

The first version is called irc-jabber, and it is only for obsolete
version of the jabber server v1.2. It supports the GroupChat (GC) v1
protocol.

The second version I know as GC IRC-t. It is the version of IRC-t from
CVS which supports the conference and browse protocols introduced in the
v1.4 jabber server. It is supported by a few of the clients, like winjab
and rival, but not gabber who decided to wait for the protocol to be
standardised. This is the version I am trying to maintain and keep sync
with Benoit's version

The third version I know as JCF IRC-t, This version of IRC-t is the one
being developed by Benoit to use the new draft JCF protocol. This is
designed to be a framework for better and more feature-rich
conferencing. The problem is that no client has support for JCF yet,
except for a hacked version of gabber (Using Benoit's patch)

Benoit and I are trying to build the latter two irc transports side by
side so that there is support for both the new and the old versions,
whilst keeping the designs seperate so they can be easily maintained.
I've also suggested making them redirect you to the other transport if
you try and use the wrong protocol to connect to the transport.

  I'm also trying to find out if I can take over the maintainership of
the GC IRC-t, so I can get the CVS version fixed. I do have a
'work-in-progress' tarball of the work done so far, if anyone wants to
see how things are going. Benoit also has the JCF version on his CVS
site, along with the patch for Gabber.
 
&gt;<i> I do a Services/Browse Jabber Conference Services, enter irc.localhost
</I>&gt;<i> as the Server to browse (since that's defined in my config file), but
</I>&gt;<i> nothing happens with Gabber and with jabberd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ok, i'll grab my copy of patched gabber (rpm) and test it again and tell
you what happened. If you want, I can look at your config file and see
if I can spot anything.
 
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   I'm currently trying to finish the patch for the CVS version so that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it can be used by clients supporting the conference protocol (not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gabber, but winjab and rival) This is aiming to be able to work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alongside the JCF irc-t .. in fact that is how I have it set up on my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's great - I hope I can contribute to this work as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Glad to hear it :)

Regards,

  David
