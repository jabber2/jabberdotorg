Please keep the mailing lists! I'm on some mozilla-* mailing list, too,
which are &quot;gatewayed&quot; to the mozilla news server and I don't think the
interface is &quot;clunky&quot; at all. Also I haven't noticed much of a delay
until my mail posted to the list appeares there.  To me, email is much
more important than news and I'd rather not use two different programms
to follow jabber and the other projects I'm interessted/involved in. And
I don't know of any programm that meets both my demands to a good mail
user agent (it would have to be as good as mutt at least) and offers
seamless usenet news integration. So please don't switch to nntp
completely. I'm sure there are others beside me who prefer the mailing
lists.

bye,
Jan
