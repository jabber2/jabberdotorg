<PRE>Hi,

To be fair to Rikard, I think his message came out of the desire to make 
people aware of Jabber. The approach he suggested may not be the most 
appropriate one, but I think his intention is clear.

I am also of the opinion that we definitely need to get more publicity than 
what we have right now. If you look at it, MSN/Yahoo/AOL all have a LOT of 
publicitly and they also advertise shamelessly (albeit on their own sites 
and their partner's sites), so I don't see anything wrong with us Jabberites 
doing that. I would really hate to see Jabber not playing a big role in the 
still 'standard-less' IM world and also in the broader realm of app-2-app 
routing. Right now, most of the publicity seems to be confined to 
organizations that are using Jabber internally and to the Open Source world.

I think we can start with first making sure the majority of the Linux world 
starts hearing about Jabber (which may already be the case) and then moving 
on to a broader base of users.

I strongly believe that Jabber has a LOT of potential to influence the way 
IM (and XML routing) shapes up in the coming future. But, I also feel that 
there needs to be a lot more 'awareness-building' among the general 
population if we are to pose a serious threat to the likes of MSN/AOL/Yahoo 
AND to make a strong case to the Standards bodies.

One simple suggestion would be to say start showing small ads on sites that 
Open Source folks frequent (like O'Reilly sites, Slashdot, Freshmeat etc). 
With the help of people like Tim O'Reilly, Craig Burton, Dave Winer, Doc 
Searls etc (all Jabber enthusiasts), I am sure we can start getting the word 
around and become more noticeable.

My 0.02 paise.

Regards,
Ragavan



&gt;<i>I tend to agree. Not to mention that we'd give them a reason to block
</I>&gt;<i>us. Think of it this way, AOL is blocking various Jabber clients out of
</I>&gt;<i>spite and some vague notion of &quot;illegal network traffic&quot;. However, Yahoo!,
</I>&gt;<i>Microsoft and ICQ (while owned by AOL) have more or less left us
</I>&gt;<i>alone. Yet Yahoo! and Microsoft are both business ventures, and they
</I>&gt;<i>probably have left us alone becuase our distribution is fairly
</I>&gt;<i>minor. However, if we start actively recruiting users through their
</I>&gt;<i>networks, they are likely to be more upset. With just a couple
</I>&gt;<i>hundred/thousand Jabber users accessing their networking, its probably a
</I>&gt;<i>minor annoyance, but if people start leaving en masse, it does damage to
</I>&gt;<i>their business model, and if we are actively attacking their bottom line,
</I>&gt;<i>there will probably be repercussions/retaliation. They may even actively
</I>&gt;<i>attempt to block Jabber servers from accessing their networks, and if this
</I>&gt;<i>happens we're back where we started -- running multiple clients.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Not to mention I would find it rather annoying should I be running
</I>&gt;<i>Yahoo!'s client or MSN Messenger and when a friend of mine said &quot;Hi, how
</I>&gt;<i>are you doing?&quot; it was automatically converted to &quot;Hi, how are you
</I>&gt;<i>doing? -- This message brought to you by Jabber. <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/&quot;.">http://www.jabber.org/&quot;.</A>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am totally against any sort of advertising such as this. Even though I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to get the word out about Jabber I don't think this is the right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way. If you are chatting with those people anyways, just mention Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to them yourself. If I were not using Jabber and received this message I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be extremely annoyed and would likely never try Jabber, but that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another point is that having any sort of static or repetative string of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text in messages to the networks we are trying to interoperate with, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are providing them with a fingerprint with which they can block us with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All they have to do is detect messages that contain that string and they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can easily drop that message or disconnect you from the server,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rendering your transport useless.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I want more people to use Jabber as much as anyone, but forcing our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message onto people who may not want it or even care about it is a bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi. Today I read news about people using multiple IM

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Jabber people who are in a position to do something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; about this. Here's a short summary of the message:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; By attaching a message to each stream going to other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; networks (ICQ, MSN, Yahoo...) Jabber can promote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interoperability and itself. This capability is unique
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to Jabber as it is the only interoperable IM platform.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What do you think? What's good about it? What's bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; about it? Alternatives?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If you think this is a good idea I'd be glad if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; influnced people in a position to do something about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it (people running servers, people coding transports,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the Jabber council etcetera).
