<PRE>Hi all, first at all, thanks for reading this mail.

Second, I'm experiencing problems with ICQ from some time ago, I don't get
any error, the problem is this: I open jabber, and I receive a lot of
messages sent to me while I was offline, but after I close and open
jabber again, I receive the messages again!! The other problem is even
worse, I see when the people logs in and out, and I can send them a
few messages, and later they don't receive my messages, I don't get any
error, but the messages get lost in the cyberspace!!! This is worse,
because the people thinks that I don't want to talk them!! hehe...

I don't know if it's jabber particular problem, I think the people @ ICQ
have changed something in the protocol, and the ICQ transport now is
having these problems... If it's something like this, I can help fixing
it (bah, I can try to help :) 

I'm in Linux, using gabber to connect, and MSN and Yahoo works very good...
I'm using my own configured jabber server, maybe it's something in the
configuration!

Well, if you have any ideas, just let me know!

Thanks a lot!!

P.D. Sorry if my english is not very good, please tell if I've made 
     some errors so I can improve my english! thanksssss!!!!!!!!!
