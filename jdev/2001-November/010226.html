<PRE>As a little project of mine I have written my own instant messaging system
which uses ideas from the different IM systems that I researched, after
seeing jabber I based my protocol on XML and a lot of the XML packet
structures are similar, but I do some things different, i.e. the addressing.

e.g.

I represent native users of my system in a similar way to email and jabber
id's like this.
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">me at domain.com</A>

But addresses of users on different systems work as follows.

MSN Messenger
msn:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at hotmail.com</A>

AIM
aim:screenname

E-mail
smtp:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at domain.com</A>

I got the idea for this from web and ftp addresses where addresses are
prefixed with the protocol identifier such as http: or ftp:

All of the actual communication with those users is tranparently handled at
the server end by transport servers which work like the jabber transports
establishing connections and translating the protocols between the systems.
Also they can be duplicated as many times as needed to handle the load and
the routing scheme distributes new sessions to the least loaded servers as
well as messages for existing sessions to the correct server.

Anyway after that ramble thats my thoughts on IM addressing.

&gt;<i> I'm sure this has probably been suggested before but perhaps it would be a
</I>&gt;<i> nice idea to add protocol specifiers to addresses (JabberIDs), to create
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber Uniform Personal Locator. This means we could access different
</I>&gt;<i> instant messaging architectures without pretending (i.e.. setting up
</I>&gt;<i> pseudo-servers to sit between jabber and the other protocols) that they
</I>work
&gt;<i> in the same way that jabber does (an e-mail like set-up), which strikes me
</I>&gt;<i> as an ugly way of doing things. This means that other protocols will  be
</I>&gt;<i> treated as other protocols, and seems a much nicer way of dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> things. Of course this probably will mean a major rewrite of some things,
</I>so
&gt;<i> is probably one for the really far into the future list, or the to hard to
</I>&gt;<i> do list (which is situated in the bin).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matthew Belll
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ps. that was a bit of a ramble wasn't it. I don't think I really got my
</I>&gt;<i> point across.
