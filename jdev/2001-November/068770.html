<PRE>I tend to agree. Not to mention that we'd give them a reason to block
us. Think of it this way, AOL is blocking various Jabber clients out of
spite and some vague notion of &quot;illegal network traffic&quot;. However, Yahoo!,
Microsoft and ICQ (while owned by AOL) have more or less left us
alone. Yet Yahoo! and Microsoft are both business ventures, and they
probably have left us alone becuase our distribution is fairly
minor. However, if we start actively recruiting users through their
networks, they are likely to be more upset. With just a couple
hundred/thousand Jabber users accessing their networking, its probably a
minor annoyance, but if people start leaving en masse, it does damage to
their business model, and if we are actively attacking their bottom line,
there will probably be repercussions/retaliation. They may even actively
attempt to block Jabber servers from accessing their networks, and if this
happens we're back where we started -- running multiple clients.

Not to mention I would find it rather annoying should I be running
Yahoo!'s client or MSN Messenger and when a friend of mine said &quot;Hi, how
are you doing?&quot; it was automatically converted to &quot;Hi, how are you
doing? -- This message brought to you by Jabber. <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/&quot;.">http://www.jabber.org/&quot;.</A>

Regards.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi. Today I read news about people using multiple IM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clients!! This made me upset so I wrote a message to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber people who are in a position to do something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about this. Here's a short summary of the message:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By attaching a message to each stream going to other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; networks (ICQ, MSN, Yahoo...) Jabber can promote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interoperability and itself. This capability is unique
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to Jabber as it is the only interoperable IM platform.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think? What's good about it? What's bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about it? Alternatives?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you think this is a good idea I'd be glad if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; influnced people in a position to do something about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it (people running servers, people coding transports,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Jabber council etcetera).
