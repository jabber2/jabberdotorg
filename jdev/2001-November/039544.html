<PRE>Hey all, I've been busy working on some of my ideas, but I've suddenly
realized one of the major problems we have.  We lack a solid
commuication link between users and developers.  Just based on my posts
to the list and my jog I've gotten a few emails and msgs discussing some
ideas, and that's absolutely wonderful, because it really was partially
the goal.  Now where are those recorded?  Well my personal notes, but
that only helps me.  Yes, we have this mailing list, but personally I
really really really dislike mailing lists =)  Plus, it doesn't bridge
in some of the conversations that are starting to pick up on msg boards
on the website, as well as lacking an easy interface (damn me for not
keeping the NNTP interface up).  So do I have a proposed solution?  Why
yes, yes I do!  It's an old idea that we like to call JabberForge (yes,
it is ripped from SourceForge).  The idea is an integration of all the
tools developers need, plus an interface to allow users to come and
interact with the project.  To take it a step further the whole system
would highly integrate with Jabber (duh!).  I'm working on a doc
outlining the system now, and construction will begin soon, so I'm
looking for input and ideas for the system asap.  Just post any thoughts
as a reply here and I'll get them on the list for eventual inclusion.
