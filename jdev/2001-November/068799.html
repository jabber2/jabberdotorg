<PRE>I'm sure this has probably been suggested before but perhaps it would be a
nice idea to add protocol specifiers to addresses (JabberIDs), to create
Jabber Uniform Personal Locator. This means we could access different
instant messaging architectures without pretending (i.e.. setting up
pseudo-servers to sit between jabber and the other protocols) that they work
in the same way that jabber does (an e-mail like set-up), which strikes me
as an ugly way of doing things. This means that other protocols will  be
treated as other protocols, and seems a much nicer way of dealing with
things. Of course this probably will mean a major rewrite of some things, so
is probably one for the really far into the future list, or the to hard to
do list (which is situated in the bin).

ps. that was a bit of a ramble wasn't it. I don't think I really got my
point across.
