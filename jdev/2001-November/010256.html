<PRE>hi list,

&gt;<i> We lack 
</I>&gt;<i> a solid commuication link between users and developers. Now 
</I>&gt;<i> where are those recorded?  Well my personal notes, but that 
</I>&gt;<i> only helps me.  Yes, we have this mailing list, but 
</I>&gt;<i> personally I really really really dislike mailing lists =)  
</I>
as a lurker on jabber activities, i can attest to that.
its hard for me to keep track of all the different initiatives
that are going on in the jabber world. plus, mailing lists
dont scale, posts are quickly forgotten once they leave your inbox,
etc.

&gt;<i> Plus, it doesn't bridge in some of the conversations that are 
</I>&gt;<i> starting to pick up on msg boards on the website, as well as 
</I>&gt;<i> lacking an easy interface (damn me for not keeping the NNTP 
</I>&gt;<i> interface up).  So do I have a proposed solution?  Why yes, 
</I>&gt;<i> yes I do!  It's an old idea that we like to call JabberForge 
</I>&gt;<i> (yes, it is ripped from SourceForge).  The idea is an 
</I>&gt;<i> integration of all the tools developers need, plus an 
</I>&gt;<i> interface to allow users to come and interact with the 
</I>&gt;<i> project.  To take it a step further the whole system would 
</I>&gt;<i> highly integrate with Jabber (duh!).  
</I>
a weblog with newsfeeds and jabber integration would be a valuable
start. you already have some of the infrastructure in place,
so its rather more an issue of integration than of wheel reinventing.

i am strongly interested in using weblog technology to facilitate
collaboration. i work in this field in fact, both by learning
from the great knowledge management weblogs mailing list at

<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/klogs/messages">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/klogs/messages</A>

and by contributing to a php based weblog system, postnuke
<A HREF="http://www.postnuke.com">http://www.postnuke.com</A>

we are facing some of the same problems within our project:

- scalability (currently 86 developers and growing rapidly)
- scope (we have about 5 major project related websites)
- user-developer gap (bug reports linger in a msg board etc)

at one time, we had more traffic on our mailing list than
linux-kernel, which told us that we have a slight problem ;)
this has led to initiatives to develop solutions along the
lines you mention, temas.

on the roadmap for our cms / weblog is xmlrpc integration.
this enables very cool stuff like the jabber-weblog integration
you did with jogger. i would be very interested to search
for common solutions / implementations.

granted i have a bias towards using our stuff with your stuff,
but on the other hand i believe this is a major win-win.
and, more importantly, any cooperation should be based on
open interfaces so that other apps (cms etc) can plug in.

hope this helps, and i look forward to your comments.
