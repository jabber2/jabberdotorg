<PRE>Hello,

  I personally think this is a great idea, and an almost vital part of
moving things forwards. Its bad enough as it is coming up with ideas and
then having to hunt over the web to find out if someone else is already
doing it. Of course, this is dependant on people keeping the data up to
date and using it, but I would definatly use it and urge anyone else to
do the same. I await the docs eagerly :)

David
