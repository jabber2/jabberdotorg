&gt;<i>A couple of questions regarding resources:

</I>
No. This cannot be done. Well, it *could* be done by using a huge DB 
that stores each ever used resource, but it is not in JServer 1.0

And I think it is rather pointless to do that. I'll explaing below


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>For example, say I come across a URL I think a friend may be interested in
</I>&gt;<i>seeing.  I know he is at work at right now (he is logged on as
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/work say) and won't have time to read it until he gets
</I>&gt;<i>home.  I want to send it to him at home so it is waiting for him, but I
</I>&gt;<i>don't know his home resource.  It could be <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/home or it
</I>&gt;<i>could be <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/StanleySt etc).  He has not left his home
</I>&gt;<i>computer logged onto Jabber.  Is there anyway I could find out?  Ideally I
</I>&gt;<i>would like to have a picklist with all the resources that a person uses
</I>&gt;<i>available when someone is sending a message.
</I>
1) Even if you knew that his home resource is e.g. 
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/home, that wouldn't matter. If you send a message 
there, and it is not online, it will be delivered to the active 
resource, in this case his <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/work.

The only way to achieve this would be if *he* set up a  mod_filter 
(possible startin JServer 1.1).

The point of Instant Messaging is to reach someone instantly, 
regardless of where he is.



&gt;<i>Also, I assume there is nothing to stop you from sending messages to
</I>&gt;<i>yourself at a different resource?  (Or at the same resource?)
</I>
No, no problem.


&gt;<i>Another thing - I understand that the Jabber ID's and resources are not case
</I>&gt;<i>sensitive, however I have a problem if I send a time/client version query to
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/winjab when they are logged on as
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>/Winjab - a query error service unavailable is returned.
</I>&gt;<i>Is this something in Jabber, or maybe a client error?
</I>
Uh... resources *are* case sensitive. That's why you get an error.


&gt;<i>  Also, I don't
</I>&gt;<i>understand why I can't send a time/client version query to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">userid at jabber.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i>and have a valid result returned.  Surely it should just go to the resource
</I>&gt;<i>with the highest priority?  Again, it returns a querty error.
</I>
I stumbled over this while implementing it into my client, too. I see 
the logic beind this decision (only resource have a client associated 
to them), but I agree with you, I'd find it more comfortable if this 
returned the version/time of the main resource.


Bye,

Max
