<PRE>&gt;<i> - if all the user files are stored in one directory, then what happens
</I>&gt;<i> when more than 35,000 people try to register?  (only ~32,000 files can
</I>&gt;<i> exist in one directory, right?!)
</I>
depends.  if you plan to have that many users, odds are that you don't
want to use flat-file storage for them anyway.  :)  32k files is a LOT of
files, even on a very fast disk on a very fast machine.  32k database
entries, on the other hand, isnt' unreasonable.  

i'm not even certain *what* an ext2 filesystem would do if you put 32k
files in one directory.  waste a lot of space, that's for sure.

at one point i had *ALL* of the CDDB data on a machine.  160MB or so of
~2k files.  it ate about 500mb of disk space, just based on teh wasted
space.  i could have fixed most of that with a drive with smaller
clusters, but it would have been much handier to just have a big ol'
database file or volume (depending on your backend) that didn't have the
sucky limitations.  deleting one file when you have 32k files in a
directory takes *FOREVER*.

the resierfs people claim they can handle something like that, but i
haven't tried it.  

disclaimer- i haven't seen the mysql jserver code.  *however*- getting it
to write to database handles and look up from there rather than the flat
files should be fairly trivial.  (for a database hacker, not necessarily
for me.  i'm thinking about complexity, not code nastiness :)  hey, i'm
just an interested design person )

:<i>)
</I>

(another question- has anybody looked at hooking jserver to anything other
than mysql or postgresql?)
