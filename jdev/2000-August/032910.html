<PRE>I'll tackle both posts here.

First, regarding the security issues, these run super deep, and super tough
due to the distributed nature.  At this point there are two solutions.  First,
if you are only using C2S and not needing to use any of the S2S (.org to .com)
then there is SSL available.  Second, we strongly encourage client authors to
support GPG/PGP in their clients.  To help this along we have come up with a
simple &lt;x/&gt; extension to do this.  I will post this on jabber.org shortly.

We are working on trying to figure out some of the S2S issues, and hopefully
find some balance of a solution, but it's not easy.  I highly encourage some
conversation on this area on the posting i make to jabber.org.  I'll try and
get it going with my thoughts up there.

Next, for the presence issues there are two interesting points here.  First,
the server already allows you to send specialized presence to a particular 
user.  This would allow me to send my boss a certain presence, while my global
presence is something else.  This is achieved by sending a regular presence tag
with a to attribute to the user you wish to have specific presencd towards.
Next, you can also use the new mod_filter for changing many different things.
It is currently in cvs, and will probably go out with the 1.0.1 release (yes, 
you heard it here first) that will be going out hopefully tonight or tomorrow.
I'll try and get Keith to put up a jabber.org post about it.

If you have any comments or questions msg me JID:  <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">temas at jabber.org</A>
