</I>&gt;<i> by target, aka, Cell, WinJab, IRC, etc..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ahh...  no way to force it to a particular resource.  I didn't think of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Currently, no.  Personally, I agree with you that Resources should, and in 
</I>&gt;<i> the past have planned to be, much more then they are currently..
</I>

mod_filter will be able to show you &quot;mailboxes&quot; or resources that a USER has setup on his server with special functionality.. i.e., you can set up a resource for yourself, such as /work, and tell mod_filter that when the /work resource is offline, and it gets a message, to store it offline (as opposed to sending it to the active session)  when you have this rule then, mod_filter will show that resource in your client (as unavailable) such as mod_offline did in the past.

Clients will aslo be able to send a jabber:x:filter packet (with thier initial presence) that can specify what TYPES of messages they can handle.. so to use my wijits for an example, wijit can only handle normal and chat messages, it cann't handle headlines, or groupchat, so it NEVER wants to even see those... it would just send a jabber:x:filter packet when it logs in, to tell the server not to send it headlines or groupchat messages, and the server will not deliver those message types.  and such is the same as my gcWijit, which only handles groupchat messages, it doesn't want to see any normal or chat, since it can't even handle them.

such is this same with a text pager, for example, you only want to see normal messages, since (if it's not a two-way pager) you cant really &quot;chat&quot; on them.


oops, that answers the question below:  =]
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Except now that is not useful to me...  I thought that it would be nice to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be able to forward a message that I got at work to my home address for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; later, but as you have pointed out, it would just come back to me at work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unless I left myself logged on at home also.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess that resources just aren't as useful as I thought they were going
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be.  :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   See above.  Alot of this is based on mod_filter.  mod_filter should have the 
</I>&gt;<i> ability to state what resources are stored offline and *ONLY* delivered to the 
</I>&gt;<i> resource, which are cc'd to another resource, etc..etc..
