<PRE>&gt;<i> Next, for the presence issues there are two interesting points here.  First,
</I>&gt;<i> the server already allows you to send specialized presence to a particular
</I>&gt;<i> user.  This would allow me to send my boss a certain presence, while my global
</I>&gt;<i> presence is something else.  This is achieved by sending a regular presence tag
</I>&gt;<i> with a to attribute to the user you wish to have specific presencd towards.
</I>&gt;<i> Next, you can also use the new mod_filter for changing many different things.
</I>&gt;<i> It is currently in cvs, and will probably go out with the 1.0.1 release (yes,
</I>&gt;<i> you heard it here first) that will be going out hopefully tonight or tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll try and get Keith to put up a jabber.org post about it.
</I>
Thanks, that's a useful thing to know.  Is mod_filter documented anywhere?  I hadn't
heard of it, though maybe that's because I haven't gone far into the server code.

Somewhat related:

Going back over the documentation I see that the presence element has a type field
that is available | unavailable | subscribe | subscribed | unsubscribe | unsubscribed
|<i> probe.  The JabberCOM documentation gives JabberPresenceType as the type for
</I>PresType in the SendPresence method, which I assume is an enum in Delphi.  VC++
imports this as &quot;long PresenceType&quot;.  It's been forever since I've thought about
Pascal.  Can anybody tell me what the mapping here is?  Is it 0 = available | 1 =
unavailable | 2 = subscribe | 3 = subscribed | 4 = unsubscribe | 5 = unsubscribed | 6
= probe?
