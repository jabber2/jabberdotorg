Personally I'm not a huge fan of IMunified.
 

1)  The members of Imunified have an add based revenue.  Therefor, I
doubt they want you to use an open source client they haven't
authorized.  I also think that although they claim to want
compatibility they only do so because it is forced on them by custo
mer demand and because AOL has a larger share of the market.  It's
highly probable that they view an open source Jabber server as
competition.  Jabber _does_ want compatibility because it's revenue is
not based on advertisements.  Jer knows that people will be willing to
pay him the big bucks to make Jabber scalable to a couple million
users.  :)

2)  They have large existing user bases that won't be eager to change
clients.  This makes me think they are most concerned about creating
compatibility at the server to server level and not at the client
level.  This fits with their advertisement business model. 

Jabber offers so much more because the server is open source and the
protocol is distributed.  I hope people don't settle for using close
source MSN just because it can now communicate to yahoo messenger, when
they could get a much better Jabber client with a Jabber account from
their ISP, college or business.

sincerely,
Dan Carpenter (error27)
