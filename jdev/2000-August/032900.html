<PRE>After going through the server code, here are my observations about the
server architecture (the client request handling part):

1. There are a list of modules to handle client requests.
2. The server socket services requests in an event based manner, and for a
specific type of request (there are 4 types), there is only a single thread
to service it.
3. The servicing thread, once it receives a request, will look through the
list of modules (callback functions), to see if the function services the
request.
4. For a specific type of requests, since there is only one single thread,
the requests will be serviced one by one rather than concurrently.
5. There are serveral services of the server that spawns its own thread.

Please correct my understanding in any area that you think I'm wrong.

Question:
1. Isn't the responsiveness of the server pretty slow for a certain type of
request due to the lack of concurrency, which is due to only a single thread
servicing the requests?
2. Anyone can recommend a server configuration for best performance? Is SCSI
or RAID configuration needed for improved performance in this case? Since
the server does not even have a lot of running threads?
3. Please enlighten me on any thoughts or comments that you guys have...

Thank you very much.

Paul
