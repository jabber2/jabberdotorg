<PRE>&gt;<i>I can't see it being that huge...  how often do people change resources?
</I>&gt;<i>How many resources do you have exactly?  :-)
</I>
Well, you can't tell. True, most ppl use only a few, but I know a guy 
that changes his each day :-)

Without looking at the server code, I don't think it would be that 
hard to store this information. But it would also require a whole new 
protocol to query this information, clients would have to suport it 
etc. It increases the complexity of the server both inter and extern, 
and honestly I doubt this addition is that useful... Just my two 
cents. I think someone of the server team should clarify this matter.


&gt;<i>  &gt; The point of Instant Messaging is to reach someone instantly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  regardless of where he is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Not true, or there would be no point in storing offline messages on the
</I>&gt;<i>server.
</I>
Well, let me reword it: The point of Instant Messaging as soon as 
possible, wherever he may be. The messages are stored on the server 
so you can send to someone even when he's not online.


&gt;<i>OMG! - that's confusing.  Why?  Why would you have one part of a URL case
</I>&gt;<i>preservative (userid and domain) and another part of the same URL case
</I>&gt;<i>sensitive?  Is this what you get when you let Unix people design protocols!
</I>&gt;<i>(Just kidding :-)  Seriously - what was the thinking behind that!?
</I>
Actually, it is this way for every URL! It doesn't matter if you 
enter www.IMUnified.org or www.imunified. But while 
<A HREF="http://www.IMUnified.org/faq.html">http://www.IMUnified.org/faq.html</A>  is a valid page, 
<A HREF="http://www.IMUnified.org/faq.HTML">http://www.IMUnified.org/faq.HTML</A> gives a 404.

Some web servers ignore the casing, but most don't.



&gt;<i>Of course.  You are asking a person what the time is.  You don't say &quot;Hey
</I>&gt;<i>buddy, what is the time according to the rolex that you have on your left
</I>&gt;<i>wrist?&quot;
</I>
Well, this is not a good comparison. The timezones at workplace and 
home can be different, while normally the timezone your left arm is 
in will be the same as the one your right arm is in... But I disgress 
:<i>)
</I>

&gt;<i>Similarly you would normally want to know what client someone is
</I>&gt;<i>using, so it should return the the results for the client that they are
</I>&gt;<i>currently using (unless you specifically request a particular resource).
</I>&gt;<i>Actually it wouldn't bother me so much if  JabberCOM always stored the
</I>&gt;<i>resource in it's JabberRosterItem, but it doesn't so I keep getting query
</I>&gt;<i>errors :-)
</I>
Well, in my client I ended up allowing Time/Version queries w/o a 
resource, and just send them to the active resource. But I think, 
too, that it would be nice to have this directly in the server.


bye,

Max
