<PRE>Quoting Michael Brown &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">michael at aurora.gen.nz</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I can't see it being that huge...  how often do people change resources?
</I>&gt;<i> How many resources do you have exactly?  :-)
</I>
  Personally, I'd say one would want two kinds of resources.  Those that are 
predefined, and those that are dynamically created.  This would actually be a 
requirement for mod_filter to do some better things, such as filtering content 
by target, aka, Cell, WinJab, IRC, etc..

&gt;<i> Ahh...  no way to force it to a particular resource.  I didn't think of
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
  Currently, no.  Personally, I agree with you that Resources should, and in 
the past have planned to be, much more then they are currently..

&gt;<i> Except now that is not useful to me...  I thought that it would be nice to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to forward a message that I got at work to my home address for
</I>&gt;<i> later, but as you have pointed out, it would just come back to me at work
</I>&gt;<i> unless I left myself logged on at home also.
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that resources just aren't as useful as I thought they were going
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> be.  :(
</I>
  See above.  Alot of this is based on mod_filter.  mod_filter should have the 
ability to state what resources are stored offline and *ONLY* delivered to the 
resource, which are cc'd to another resource, etc..etc..
