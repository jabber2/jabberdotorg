That's a bad sign....

That's probably true.  But then again it doesn't seem *that* difficult, 
since they are saying it is only a stopgap until IETF has a standard.  All 
they have to do is come up with a &quot;universal handshake&quot; type of thing that 
each of them will agree to support.  But maybe I don't know what I'm 
talking about.... :)

&gt;<i>It'll be a long time before IMUnified releases something of substance that

Probably true, but keep in mind that they are already hacking each other's 
protocols, so if all their coalition is is an agreement that the developers 
will cooperate and that they won't intentionally block other members 
systems, it is something that could be useful to them right away.  You'd 
hope it is a little more ambitious than that though.
