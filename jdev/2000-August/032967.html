<PRE>I have asked this question to Thomas and Peter and they both suggested
that I post it here so that everyone can see it and help me understand
why the behaviour is working like it now does.

I have 2 people A and B. Neither are subscribed to each other.

A subscribes to B and B is added to A's roster with a subscription of
&quot;none&quot;.
B is online but has not yet confirmed the subscription/ or offline
completely.
A decide to delete B from his contact list which removes B from A's
roster list.
B now confirms the subscription to A.
A's roster list is now modified to again contain B with a &quot;to&quot;
subscription.
So B now suddenly starts appearing back on A's contact list/roster.

Why does this happen?

Shouldn't the server note the response from B, check A's roster and see
that B does not exist there and simply throw away the &quot;subscribed&quot;
response?

Otherwise I have the problem of deleted users occasionally popping back
up in the roster.

Not to mention one could spam everyone elses contact list by getting a
dummy jabber name and writing a client that just sends out &quot;subscribed&quot;
to every jabber user. Sure they can't watch your presence, but they can
fill up your contact list.
