<PRE>Hey Rob...

This has come up quite a few times over the evolution of the Jabber project. :)
One of the original design goals of the Jabber project was to support IM
across firewalls. Frankly, client-client connections don't fit into that design
goal -- and never will, probably.

That said, I would be remiss to not say that it's perfectly 
possible to write some add-on modules for the server that would provide this kind 
of functionality. The reason the Jabber project hasn't pursued this is because
we feel it's outside (way, way outside) the scope of the project and the 
complexity it adds is not worth the investment in time.

Jabber was designed to be server-centric from the beginning. Writing extensions
that add client-client functionality will wind up being &quot;hackish&quot; and are better
left to architectures which were designed with different goals in mind.

</I>&gt;<i> chat mode (where characters show up as you type them), but even that might 
</I>&gt;<i> put a lot of strain on the server since it is so inefficient.  If you are 
</I>&gt;<i> connected peer-to-peer, who cares?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to address most if not all of the reasons I have seen given for

</I>&gt;<i> people on other systems (ICQ etc) would still go through the server of 
</I>&gt;<i> course, and the client can still be ultra-simple if it doesn't want to 
</I>&gt;<i> bother supporting this protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Has anything like this been discussed?  Already been soundly rejected? :)
