&gt;<i> I'm considering which XEPs to implement.
</I>The Compliance Suites XEPs might be relevant. 302 is currently  still
Experimental, but it should at least give you an idea of what would be
good to implement.

&gt;<i> User Avatars:
</I>&gt;<i> XEP-0153 vs XEP-0084
</I>54+153 is what's in widespread use now, don't know if anyone has
implemented 84 yet, but I can't see how it hurts since it's based on
PEP, so server support is pretty widespread now.

&gt;<i> Delayed Delivery:
</I>&gt;<i> XEP-0091 vs XEP-0203
</I>I don't think you loose much by implementing the later.

&gt;<i> File Transfer:
</I>&gt;<i> XEP-0096 vs XEP-0234
</I>Jingle is the future! ;)

&gt;<i> Entity Capabilities:
</I>&gt;<i> XEP-0115 v1.3 vs XEP-0115 v1.5
</I>I'd recommend you implement the latest version. Clients doing the older
version can be ignored and disco#info'd, they are AFAIK so few that it
doesn't matter much.

&gt;<i> XEP-0154: User Profile has been deferred, so I guess at least that one
</I>&gt;<i> definitely goes to XEP-0054. 
</I>As mentioned above 54 is in widespread use. You'd want to look at
XEP-0292: vCard4 Over XMPP, which is supposed to be the way forward.

&gt;<i> Further, what's the state of end-to-end encryption?
</I>XEP-0247: Jingle XML Streams and STARTTLS would be the cool thing to do
IMO. :)
