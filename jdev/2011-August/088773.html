Yes, I've looked into it. XEP-0198 seems to be a huge undertaking to add to an already existing library, but I'll look into that.
The problem with XEP-0302 is that it's what the XMPP Standards Foundation wants us to implement, not what's actually out there.
I want to implement all of the new toys, but I still have to support the older stuff for talking to existing clients.

libpurple (Pidgin &amp; Adium) support XEP-0084, since I implemented it myself :)
I guess I'll have to implement both.

&gt;<i> &gt; XEP-0096 vs XEP-0234

Yes, but is its way of doing file transfer supported by some clients?

&gt;<i> As mentioned above 54 is in widespread use. You'd want to look at
</I>&gt;<i> XEP-0292: vCard4 Over XMPP, which is supposed to be the way forward.
</I>
Thanks for the tip!

&gt;<i> &gt; Further, what's the state of end-to-end encryption?
</I>&gt;<i> XEP-0247: Jingle XML Streams and STARTTLS would be the cool thing to do
</I>&gt;<i> IMO. :)
</I>
Hmm that XEP is deferred, so I guess nothing will be available for a while&#8230;
