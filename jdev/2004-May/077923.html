<PRE>&gt;<i> I think Jabber website has very poor resources for
</I>&gt;<i> client-side developers. I understand that there is no
</I>&gt;<i> need for another chat client, but what about people
</I>&gt;<i> that want to use Jabber for distributed computing? I
</I>&gt;<i> think Jabber is really a great platform for cluster
</I>&gt;<i> computing. Some details like connection,
</I>&gt;<i> disconnection, fault-tolerance, logging are all
</I>&gt;<i> built-in. I mean, Jabber has a huge potential as a
</I>&gt;<i> developer's tool, yet you can't tell it from the
</I>&gt;<i> website. Just as a standardized log monitoring
</I>&gt;<i> utility, its value is already unbelievable. I think
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber's focus is misplaced: it tries only to portray
</I>&gt;<i> itself as public chat utility for general audience,
</I>&gt;<i> forgetting that itself is a good developer's tool:
</I>&gt;<i> like XML-RPC, Zope, etc. The website really ought to
</I>&gt;<i> separate the general-consumer part from the developer
</I>&gt;<i> part, and maybe have some topic guides, or even some
</I>&gt;<i> Wiki for developers.
</I>
Its true that it does have far more uses than just IM and is more of a
general XML routing framework but up until now the majority of interest in
Jabber has been its IM platform which is why most of the site concentrates
on this.

&gt;<i> There is no tutorial and sample usage of the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> on the website, at all. The RFC-style protocol
</I>&gt;<i> description is just not good for someone that is
</I>&gt;<i> beginning.
</I>
Well currently that is the best place to start if you want to be XMPP
conformant.

&gt;<i> Could someone point out some resources to me? Some
</I>&gt;<i> websites? I would like to use Jabber from C++/C# and
</I>&gt;<i> Python.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been able to send simple messages from Python,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'd like to know things like how to open a
</I>&gt;<i> chatroom, join a chatroom, etc. And other features
</I>&gt;<i> like how to send/receive files. If someone knows where
</I>&gt;<i> to get started with C++/C#, that would be great, too.
</I>
Your best option is to read the JEPs on those subjects and raise any
questions about them on this list. To help speed your development I would
suggest you look at the code libraries available which are listed at the
following URL <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/software/libraries.php">http://www.jabber.org/software/libraries.php</A>

&gt;<i> (I know, I may just have to buy the book. But this is
</I>&gt;<i> unusual, for other software utilities, I usually have
</I>&gt;<i> been able to try out first, get some familiarity, and
</I>&gt;<i> then decide whether I need a book.)
</I>
Most of the Jabber books ive seen have been out for quite a while and will I
expect be very out of date for all but the most simplest things, I doubt its
worth buying them.
