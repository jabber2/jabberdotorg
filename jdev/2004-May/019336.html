Yeah, definitely in this case you need to do both.

&gt;<i> 2) If there are elements recognized by the client as non-IM (such as IBB
</I>&gt;<i> data or a chat state change), then the client should process the stanza in
</I>&gt;<i> this way.  If there are multiple such elements, then only one kind of

</I>
I would say that multiple need to be accounted for in this case, actually, 
rather than ignoring further ones.

&gt;<i> 3) If there are elements recognized by the client as text, such as &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> or &lt;html&gt;, then the message should be considered an IM.
</I>
Other than needing to move this step to last place, this is spot on.

&gt;<i> 4) However, if there are elements recognized by the client as
</I>&gt;<i> psuedo-attachments, such as contact items, groupchat invites, x:oob urls,
</I>&gt;<i> then these can be processed as either an IM (with empty body if &lt;body&gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> not present), or in a special way.
</I>
And multiples definitely need to be handled here because you might send 
multiple attachments.

Of course there are much more sophisticated things which could happen.  You 
could receive a message which contains nothing but an encrypted message, 
which when unwrapped, contains a signature, a body, and a bunch of attached 
roster items.  The encrypted message when encountered would be unwrapped, and 
then pushed back to the top of the chain.  The signature when encountered 
would be checked, and the message would be pushed down to the next point in 
the chain.

I think what we really need is a defined chain of processing by the client for 
message stanzas, so that all clients can follow a single guideline, and so 
that maybe even the JEPs could specify which point in the pipeline each 
different JEP applies to, if the processing is relevant to the particular 
JEP.
