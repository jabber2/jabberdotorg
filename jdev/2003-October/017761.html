<PRE>Naturally it would help if I finally got around to writing a developer
guide! So I certainly don't blame Steven. Preparations are under way for
working on more documentation.

</I>&gt;<i> because they broke the existing protocol rather than using extablished

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;presence type=&quot;promiscuous&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This breaks existing protocol and could cause problems if they come into

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;presence&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;promiscuous xmlns=&quot;<A HREF="http://yourwebsite.com/jabber/promiscuous&quot;/">http://yourwebsite.com/jabber/promiscuous&quot;/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/presence&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whereas this uses the standard method of protocol extension and should not
</I>&gt;<i> cause any problems when coming into contact with standard compliant
</I>&gt;<i> implementations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that the main problem is the seeming lack of caring and &quot;willy
</I>&gt;<i> nilly&quot; approach that was used with creating the modification, which could
</I>&gt;<i> cause problems for the greater Jabber community as a whole. If you work with
</I>&gt;<i> us not against us I doubt you will have any problems and more importantly
</I>&gt;<i> not cause the rest of us problems that we have to then clean up.
