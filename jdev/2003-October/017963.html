<PRE>&gt;<i> We are updating the software listings at jabber.org (and preparing for
</I>&gt;<i> software listings at xmpp.org). Eventually we will update the client, 
</I>&gt;<i> component, and library listings, but the first step is to update the 
</I>&gt;<i> server listings. These listings will be much more complete than what is
</I>&gt;<i> at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/admin/serverlist.php">http://www.jabber.org/admin/serverlist.php</A>&gt; right now. In order to 
</I>&gt;<i> update the listings, I need to gather detailed information about each
</I>&gt;<i> server in the list. Therefore please send me a message off-list about
</I>&gt;<i> which of the following you support:
</I>
I'll email you seperately about j2. Just a couple of queries about this
list:

&gt;<i> JEP-0004 (x:data interfaces to the server)
</I>
What does that mean? x:data doesn't mean anything without context (like
x:data bits in registration, ad-hoc commands, etc).

&gt;<i> JEP-0106 (jid escaping)
</I>
What does this mean for a server? It doesn't seem (from a quick reread
of the JEP) that servers actually have to do anything with an escaped
JID.

&gt;<i> storefile (data storage on the file system)
</I>&gt;<i> storeldap (data storage in LDAP)
</I>&gt;<i> storeberkeley (data storage in Berkeley DB)
</I>&gt;<i> storepostgres (data storage in PostgreSQL)
</I>&gt;<i> storemysql (data storage in MySql)
</I>&gt;<i> storemssql (data storage in MS SQL Server)
</I>&gt;<i> storeoracle (data storage in Oracle DB)
</I>&gt;<i> storeactivedir (data storage in Active Directory)
</I>&gt;<i> storeother (data storage in some other storage system)
</I>
Does an authentication source count as &quot;data storage&quot;? eg, j2 can auth
against users stored in LDAP, but no user data is actually stored in
LDAP.

&gt;<i> These are all boolean -- either you support them fully or you don't. If
</I>&gt;<i> you have been tracking the XMPP specs but support some really recent
</I>&gt;<i> version rather than the ones I published just the other day, we'll cut
</I>&gt;<i> you some slack and call your support complete. (If you support the XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> specs, we will list you at xmpp.org once that is up and running.)
</I>
&gt;<i> These seem like the most important features, but feel free to suggest 
</I>&gt;<i> others. Perhaps items for the ability to connect or send messages via 
</I>&gt;<i> SMS, WAP, Wireless Village, SIP/SIMPLE, etc.? (The current features for 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;MS Exchange Integration&quot; and &quot;Netmeeting Integration&quot; are not clear to 
</I>&gt;<i> me and to others who've asked me about them, which is why I've removed 
</I>&gt;<i> them from the list, but I can be convinced to add them back.)
</I>
They sound more like transport features. If they're bundled with the
server, then perhaps, but I can see a case where a server that comes
with, say, a SIMPLE transport looks more featureful than a server that
isn't bundled with one but can use a third-party version. This argument
could also be made for features like &quot;message logging&quot;.

I'm just trying to skew it to make jabberd2 look the best, of course ;)

Nice stuff :)

Rob.
