No, I didn't speek about seeding. I meant that the ID that is
transmitted could be just the timestamp with an appended serial number
if there are multiple logins in the same second.

If you seed with time and serial, the seeding value is not much less
predictable than if you just use the timestamp.

I just wanted to tell that the IDs don't have to be unpredictable but
just unique. As soon as a client connects the ID is transmitted in clear
anyway. Even if you know the ID before you can not use the additional
time you have, because what would you do with that time? There is
nothing you can try to break brute force with that ID.
It is really only uniqueness, because if it is not unique and we sniffed
what the client sent as response, we can replay this response if the
same ID comes back.

I spoke with Maqi about that and we thought that it would maybe a
solution to seed the random number generator with /dev/urandom. I expect
that would be fine with you too.
