<PRE>All of the jadc2s testing was done before these patches were applied to cvs.
However, we had all rate limited turned off for the tests. Basically, jadc2s was
unable to EVER login more than 4000 conns during our load tests. It also
consumes approx TWICE as much CPU as the jinc CM which were looking to migrate
to. This move will give j.org a significant amount of breathing room for quite a
while.

The second patch would fix the problem of mis-delivered packets. Are these fixes
in current CVS, or have they just been posted to the mailing list?

I may be able to run some additional tests sometime this week... however, it's
much harder now that jabber.org has been completely moved to zeus (the new HP
box).

BTW, I was also unable to ever get karma working correctly.. It produced lots of
cores. Could be a misconfiguration problem, so some examples should be added to
the sample configs, etc.

pgm.
