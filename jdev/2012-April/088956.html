To elaborate on this: libpurple definitely supports SRV queries. In fact,
there are two implementations for it: there is an implementation for Windows
that uses dnsapi.dll and there is an implementation for *NIX that forks and
uses res_query. Aside from that, 2.8.0 included a patch I wrote to add an API
for UIs to supply their own functions for TXT and SRV queries[1] (however, it
had some significant bugs that were fixed in 2.10.0, don't try to use it in
earlier versions). I still need to finish up the custom implementation that
Adium will use (the fork() method works on OS X, but it's discouraged to
call fork without exec in graphical applications).

But that's not the issue they have, they want to replace libpurple with an
XMPP backend written in JavaScript, however, that doesn't support SRV as they
don't have an API in JavaScript for it.
