<PRE>We are pleased to announce the release of Prosody 0.2.0.

This release has been mostly about improving interoperability, though
we have added a handful of new features also, including support for
running as a daemon under POSIX systems (running as a Windows service
is on the way).

Prosody is a lightweight Jabber/XMPP server written in Lua. It aims
to be flexible, easy to extend, and simple to use for both users
and developers alike.

The following is a summary of changes since the previous version:

	- Fix to not send stream:features to incoming s2s connections
	  (we don't support SASL/TLS on s2s yet). This fixes s2s with
	  multiple other implementations, including Jabber XCP and
	  jabberd2.
	- Disconnect connections sending bad XML, rather than
	  raising an error
	- Dialback fix to work with jabberd2
	- Support for remote servers doing dialback piggybacking.
	  Fixes the potential problems with Google Talk domains.
	- Fix for major bug on TLS connections, which caused a big
	  slow-down when a client connected with TLS
	- Support for daemonizing on POSIX systems
	- Latin1 support for DIGEST-MD5
	- Slightly more secure dialback secret generation :)
	- IDNA fix for DIGEST-MD5 with some clients
	- Fix potential data loss when closing a connection with a
	  write queue over a certain threshold
	- Port numbers are now customisable through the config file
	- Fixes for the ejabberd dump importer
	- Fix for dialback to work with internal components
	- Lots of performance improvements (2.5x increase in
	  benchmark results)
	- General code improvements, and small internal fixes
	- Various logging improvements
	- Return errors for undeliverable stanzas over s2s

In addition there is a new BOSH module, and built-in HTTP server in
their early stages. Neither should be considered for real use yet,
though testing and bug reports are appreciated.

Known issues:
- Features listed in &lt;stream:features&gt; may be duplicated (one per host).
  As there are no known interoperability issues stemming from this, we
  decided not to let it block the release.

- Harmless warnings are printed at startup about multiple modules
  being loaded. This is related to the above issue, and will also
  be fixed in the next release.

Happy Jabbering,
