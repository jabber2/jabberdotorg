I know. But maybe one client is not behind a NAT. In that case we could
open a TCP connection directly. Or one client behind a NAT has UPnP IGD
or NAT-PMP support in the router. It would be a shame to go into the UDP
trouble if one of these solutions work.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some ideas. Maybe we can discuss it, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Streaming audio/video where you can seek? :)
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Maybe this should be implemented in Jingle Audio/Video and not in
</I>&gt;<i> Jingle File Transfers. 
</I>
I don't like RTP for my use case. Why sacrifice a packet that is too
late when you are watching a video from your home server? I don't need
the real-time from RTP in this case. I will go into details in a post on
the standards list. Give me some time to sort my memory. :)

&gt;<i> But OTOH, seeking in File Transfers would allow
</I>&gt;<i> something like XMPPFS :).
</I>
And it shouldn't be too hard to code for Linux using Fuse. I wrote a
small Fuse filesystem once, not a big deal. It sounds like a very crazy
idea ... I like it. :) If there is djmount [1], why not XMPPFS?
