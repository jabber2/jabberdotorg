<PRE>Hello to the group,

	I have a problem with a Java client that I have written and was
wondering if anyone else had run across a similar situation. As mentioned in
the subject line the client is written in Java. It uses the JabberBeans
framework (0.9.0-pre4) APIs as the basis for communication with a Jabber
server. The client works fine when run on the WindowsNT 4.0 operating
system. However, when run on Red Hat Linux 6.2 the client is never connected
to the server. The client sends the correct username and password to the
appropriate server but never receives a connection notification from the
server. No packets from the server are ever received by my client after my
client sends the authentication packet. Has anyone else seen this type of
problem? 


Thank you 
Aubrey
