<PRE>All,

I have spent the last week working on cleaning up the karma implementation
in the source release for 1.4.1.  I was unable to find some of the CVS
sources therefore I made my changes based on 1.4.1 and not the latest dev
source, so whoever does the merge please forgive me.

I believe it can now work as intended.  It also allows for the inheritance
of the default values set in &lt;io&gt; for karma in other services that would
like to set their own karma values for their connections.

I made a few changes to the karma struct so if you have your own service
that wants to set karma please review the changes I have made in client.c or
dialback.c.  Please review your code for compatibility with the new struct
and methods.  karma_check is deprecated now.

As I went through the code I found several problems associated with karma
and have corrected them.

I have added a new karma tag &lt;resetmeter&gt;, the default value is false for
now.  What it does is, when your karma is restored your byte count is reset
to zero.  I prefer total absolution, but you must turn this on otherwise it
works as before forcing your karma down faster once you have transgressed.
&lt;resetmeter&gt;1&lt;/resetmeter&gt;  # makes it true

The &lt;init&gt; tag now does what it was meant to do initialize a new connection
with a certain karma value at the start.  This never worked because it was
ignored.

Setting the &lt;dec&gt; tag value to 0 disables karma processing for that
connection.  Karma and rating are not the same and I have note investigated
rating to explain the difference.

I have made a good attempt of cleaning up karma and I think I have made the
processing at the core server loop more efficient.

I have a tar posted with the changed files and diffs at
<A HREF="http://sirlabs.com/karma1.4.1patches.tgz">http://sirlabs.com/karma1.4.1patches.tgz</A> .
Files changed:
client.c
dialback.c
jabberd.h
karma.c
lib.h
mio.c


Please try my changes and provide any feedback and let me know if I broke
anything I was unaware of.  I did test the changes and believe it to be with
out any obvious issues.


Do you think that karma should be applied to writing sockets?
