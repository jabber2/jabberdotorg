<PRE>Well, client guidelines are on the list for discussion within the 
Foundation -- see the progress report at <A HREF="http://jabber.org/?oid=1406">http://jabber.org/?oid=1406</A>

Personally I think we might have different levels of compatibility 
(Level 1 is basic messaging, Level 2 includes conferencing and file 
transfer -- or whatever).

&gt;<i> By the way: in my opinion the best solution should be to leave Jabber.com with
</I>&gt;<i> the logo and &quot;Jabber&quot; name and invent something else for the community.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately for us all, Dixon Canario is right (even if I don't like that
</I>&gt;<i> he treated us like the &quot;sons of #@%!%&quot;):  &quot;it is open source, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> is still their stuff&quot;.
</I>

Well, I disagree. It's not their (==Jabber.com's) stuff, it's *our* 
stuff -- the whole community's, but especially those who have built this 
technology. Jabber.com is part of that community but not the only 
member, and IMHO they will become less significant in the community over 
time as more and more people and organizations contribute. One important 
feature of creating the Jabber Foundation will be to separate the 
protocol from the source code. Currently Jabber.com's server source code 
is closed, but that doesn't particularly matter since the protocol is 
open. The more we document the protocol, the easier it will be for other 
people and organizations to create their own server implementations 
(open or closed, whatever language they want).

&quot;Jabber&quot; is starting to have meaning for people and it would be crazy to 
throw away that &quot;brand recognition&quot;. That's not in the best interest of 
Jabber.com or anyone in the Jabber community.

Or so it seems to me.

Peter
