<PRE>Why don't you all start your own project give it a name, and make it open
source..... and then you will probably feel the same way that the people
that work so hard to make the &quot;jabber&quot; name come to live and that are also
sharing this project with all of us... for free.... and are now trying to
make money out of it..... why don't you just make your own project and give
it your own name......  why you all have to be trying to steal what belongs
to &quot;Jabber.com&quot; yeah is open source....  but it is still their stuff.... if
you all keep complaining about something none of us did or came out with the
idea of it..... they might just make it &quot;Closed-Source&quot; ..... I just think
that all the ones talking about... Why Jabber owns the name.. and all that
crap about the name... are nothing but a bunch of Selfish .... Son Of
#@%!%.................. tha's just my opinion... so stopped sending stuff
about  the Damn name and let's talk about coding development and taking
Jabber to the next level...........

Peace Everyone.. and yes I'm ready for the HEAT.......... so bring it on....

    Is Jabber.com the only commercial company allowed to
    use the word &quot;Jabber&quot; for their company names and
    products? This is not fair.


  I agree. And this brings up a tangential question: what are the rules for
Jabber clients' use of the Jabber &quot;lightbulb&quot; logo, and where can I get a
canonical image of the logo to use in my client? I haven't seen any on the
websites (wherever the logo appears it's joined into some other artwork in
such a way that extracting it would be beyond my artistic skills.)
