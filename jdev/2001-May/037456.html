<PRE>Re: [JDEV] Problems with a Jabber client written in Java (It works on NT but not on Linux)Aubrey,

I posted before, but you may have missed it. I have a working client written in Java that runs on Windows (9x, NT, 2000), Linux, and Solaris. I used my own libraries which you can download from <A HREF="http://www.alsutton.com/kvmjab/.">http://www.alsutton.com/kvmjab/.</A>

Regards,

Al

  David, 

  Thank you for your response. I am using the Sun JDK 1.2.2. It seems to be something going on at the socket layer. I am able send the client initializing info to the server but I don't get a response back from the server. Do you know if any one has written and run a Java Jabber client on Linux??

  The only thing which comes to mind right off the bat is that Redhat 
  installed kaffe, and it is being used instead of Sun's JDK. I have never 
  done testing with JabberBeans on kaffe.

  &gt; Hello to the group, 
  &gt; 
  &gt;         I have a problem with a Java client that I have written and 
  &gt; was wondering if anyone else had run across a similar situation. As 
  &gt; mentioned in the subject line the client is written in Java. It uses 
  &gt; the JabberBeans framework (0.9.0-pre4) APIs as the basis for 
  &gt; communication with a Jabber server. The client works fine when run on 
  &gt; the WindowsNT 4.0 operating system. However, when run on Red Hat Linux 
  &gt; 6.2 the client is never connected to the server. The client sends the 
  &gt; correct username and password to the appropriate server but never 
  &gt; receives a connection notification from the server. No packets from 
  &gt; the server are ever received by my client after my client sends the 
  &gt; authentication packet. Has anyone else seen this type of problem? 
  &gt; 
  &gt; Thank you 
  &gt; Aubrey
