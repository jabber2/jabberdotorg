<PRE>Wow that was repeitive and rambly sorry, just kind of stirred, and I'm
not sure why.  I'm starting to think this thread is very off topic for
the jdev mailing list, but I can think of a better place for it to
happen.  Any ideas?

</I>&gt;<i> these &quot;mundane&quot; tasks, not one bit, so how is the relaxing of a name

</I>&gt;<i> Frankly, I don't think it will because corporations have to make money.

</I>&gt;<i> Having someone sit around and work on public documentation rather than a
</I>&gt;<i> manual to your software, or tech docs to your software just doesn't make
</I>&gt;<i> sense to me.  I'm sure this doesn't necessarily make sense coming from
</I>&gt;<i> someone that works for a company on only open source projects, but I
</I>&gt;<i> have helped jabber.com make money by going to corporations and doing
</I>&gt;<i> tech talks, and by advocating Jabber in general.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None of that are statements made regarding the specific use of the word
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber in a product or name, here are some of my personal thoughts on
</I>&gt;<i> the name issue:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How does the possiblity of getting hired by a company be affected by the
</I>&gt;<i> name (such as only Jabber.Com), I feel I would have just as much with
</I>&gt;<i> O'Reilly, or some company looking for a real sharp technical writer (how
</I>&gt;<i> many instant messaging startups are there out there right now?  I dunno
</I>&gt;<i> let me look in my inbox at some of the job solicitations).  The name
</I>&gt;<i> does not reflect that at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My thoughts on the issue overall are this (speaking from a purely not
</I>&gt;<i> jabber.com view).  The real issue here is who holds the Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> trademark, not how it is carried out.  I strongly, and I do mean
</I>&gt;<i> strongly feel that it should not be polluted in the way that Linux has.
</I>&gt;<i> Ponder this question:  &quot;Do you have Linux?&quot;  Now if I was asked this by
</I>&gt;<i> a person I didn't know would I think they mean linux th e OS, Red Hat
</I>&gt;<i> Linux, a VA Linux workstation, a VA Linux server, a Pocket Linux system?
</I>&gt;<i> What the heck do they want to know?!  The Linux trademark is very very
</I>&gt;<i> polluted now, what if I went out and made a killer win32 jabber client
</I>&gt;<i> and called it Linux Thang.  Everyone takes to calling it Linux and I get
</I>&gt;<i> millions upon millions of downloads, suddenly someone once again says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hey you got that new Linux yet?&quot;  Oh man, is that a kernel or the new
</I>&gt;<i> release I just made of my client.  Dang I'm stuck.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Summarize, I do not think that companies or anyone should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> freely use the word Jabber like that.  What I do think should be
</I>&gt;<i> available is an easy to use process to receive a derivate certification
</I>&gt;<i> mark from the trademark holder, or some other derivate mark that then
</I>&gt;<i> fully gives me the right to use the word, phrase, symbol whatever for
</I>&gt;<i> the spreading of my work or ideas.  Jabber is something amazing, and it
</I>&gt;<i> really should be available to all and be allowed to easily spread and
</I>&gt;<i> become the de facto IM standard.  I really do _not_ want it to become
</I>&gt;<i> another word that has absolutely no meaning and solidarity, because that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't let us achieve what we want.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; people, not the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; corporations, and suggesting otherwise is a bit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ludicrous in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; These are mundane tasks, and basically no one will

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in them for a while, and eventually come back.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This shows my point, Temas.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People obviously aren't willing to do the mundane
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tasks.  Jabber.com comes along, and makes some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; progress on this, but still there are only 5 &quot;core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dudes&quot; making progress in getting things out.  (your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; words)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If other corporations besides Jabber.com are allowed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to get involved, they can put resources and money into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this as well.  But other corporations are being told
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by Jabber.com not to mention Jabber in their company
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; names, product names, domain names, etc, thus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deflecting them away from Jabber and away from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contributing to Jabber.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I think more volunteer Jabber programmers &amp; tech
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; writers would get involved if there was the potential
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of several corporations possibly hiring them, not just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber.com.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you want more than 5 core dudes, make Jabber OPEN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for real!
