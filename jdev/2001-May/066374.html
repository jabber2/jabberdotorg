I see a few more choices. There's a distinction between using the name 
&quot;Jabber&quot; as part of a product name, vs. simply declaring the product as 
&quot;Jabber compatible&quot; (and of course using the word &quot;Jabber&quot; or the light 
bulb logo in the UI.)

I don't really have a problem with Jabber.com restricting the use of 
Jabber in product or company names. But trying to prevent commercial 
products from using the name &quot;Jabber&quot; to indicate compatibility would be 
a horrible move that would cripple the Jabber project. Fortunately it 
doesn't sound as though Jabber.com is making any such moves.

It would be fine if Jabber.com or the Jabber Foundation want to 
establish some kind of testing as a requirement for declaring Jabber 
compatibility (the way Sun has done with Java) but as others have 
pointed out, it's going to be quite a while before the Jabber protocols 
are well enough defined for that to be possible. (I for one would be 
overjoyed if there were a rigorous compatibility spec and test kit I 
could use with my client...)
