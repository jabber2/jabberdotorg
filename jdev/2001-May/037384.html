<PRE>Do you mean that the sender of the key would sign the key? Or do you
mean that a third party would sign the key?

So far, I think that the list of key exchange methods are manual, 
x509 via vcard or some other server side thing, or query response
for keys - the sender would not be able to sign the key since the
key is what they would use for signing (it would be sort of useless). :)
If we want third party signed keys, X509 certificates would already fulfil
that need.
