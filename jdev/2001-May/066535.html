  Amen !

  Not that I know of (i.e. not at W3C !). The WAP forum is a W3C member
and as such can provide a contribution for sharing on W3C space. This
doesn't mean that W3C has worked on it or endorsed the proposal.

  The problem of a non-generic compression schemes is that usually
it won't evolve well with time, if you look at the one from WAP, reusing
it in another context it may provide less gain than a generic compressor.
And considering the fact that XML is used because of its extensivity, 
I'm afraid that any algorithm based on a predefined set of tokens won't
work well.

&gt;<i> On another note, something that pushes jabber away from wireless devices
</I>&gt;<i> is its dependence (at least what I see as a dependence) on a stream
</I>&gt;<i> transport.  Most wireless transports do not provide reliable, ordered,
</I>&gt;<i> stream delivery.  
</I>
  This can be seen as one of the drawback of the initial choice to encode
the protocol as 2 XML streams. I still think that this choice was one
of the brilliant design decision which boosted Jabber when it started.
Of course I'm a bit biased :-) . The capacity to extend the language
through namespaces seems to be widely used, and full support of the 
Unicode at the transport level sounds very important too. Maybe in a couple
of year when we have a more mature point of view someone will have to
collect the good of bad points of the initial design decisions.
