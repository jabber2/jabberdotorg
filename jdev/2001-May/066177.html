<PRE>There are quite some people out there using Jabber on MacOS Classic 
and MacOS X. But I never really see/hear/notice much of us.

There have been several attempts to get the jabber server running on 
MacOS X. But I can't find any resources on it, and I was never able 
to get it running myself (it always dies quickly)

There are several client projects going on (including the ones I 
(co-)work on, Jabbernaut and JabberFoX). But most are not released, 
or can't be found, or are not actively developed anymore, or have 
other limitations.


Why isn't there more collaboration? If we would join efforts, I am 
sure much more could we done.

So here is what I propose:


1) If you haven't yet, join the Jabber-Macintosh mailing list! Do it 
here <A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/mac-dev">http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/mac-dev</A>

2) Let's collect all the success/problems encountered with getting 
the server to run on OS X. In particular, what changes to the source 
are necessary? What is not working? Why is it not working? What can 
we do about it?.

3) Get together talking about clients. I'd love to hear about other 
clients out there for MacOS X.

4) On the long term, we would want to enable dynamic lib building for 
Jabberd, and provide a nice Cocoa app to administrate it. Let's try 
to make OS X one of the best platforms to run a Jabber server on ;)

5) And other stuff, too! Please make suggestions what could be done 
to give Jabber on MacOS and especially MacOS X a boost.



Remember: Joined resources equal to more power!


Max
