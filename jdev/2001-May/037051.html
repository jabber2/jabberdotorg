<PRE>I think that while a logo/certification type thing with the protocol may
be seen as just trying to control the protocol, I see it more as trying
to keep the clients on the same track. Jabber's young now, and there's
no real reason why a client should support certain features instead of
others.

The big difference is that the standard for the logo/certification would
be decided by members of the Jabber Foundation, most likely the same
people that are writing the clients to begin with. Sun didn't exactly
take random Java developers to decide and &quot;control&quot; the 100% Java
standard.
