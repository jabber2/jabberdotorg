</I>&gt;<i> happen.  Any ideas?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they have not yet made any progress on getting people to do mundane
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tasks.  They are still carried out by by the people that have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working on them since the beginning of Jabber.  I began my tasks long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before I was hired by Jabber.Com.  As is right now, at this very instant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing has changed in the process for new people to join and help in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these &quot;mundane&quot; tasks, not one bit, so how is the relaxing of a name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; going to change anything?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Frankly, I don't think it will because corporations have to make money.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Writing publiically available documentation makes a company no money.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Having someone sit around and work on public documentation rather than a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manual to your software, or tech docs to your software just doesn't make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sense to me.  I'm sure this doesn't necessarily make sense coming from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone that works for a company on only open source projects, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have helped jabber.com make money by going to corporations and doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tech talks, and by advocating Jabber in general.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; None of that are statements made regarding the specific use of the word
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber in a product or name, here are some of my personal thoughts on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the name issue:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How does the possiblity of getting hired by a company be affected by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; name (such as only Jabber.Com), I feel I would have just as much with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; O'Reilly, or some company looking for a real sharp technical writer (how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many instant messaging startups are there out there right now?  I dunno
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let me look in my inbox at some of the job solicitations).  The name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not reflect that at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My thoughts on the issue overall are this (speaking from a purely not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jabber.com view).  The real issue here is who holds the Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trademark, not how it is carried out.  I strongly, and I do mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; strongly feel that it should not be polluted in the way that Linux has.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ponder this question:  &quot;Do you have Linux?&quot;  Now if I was asked this by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a person I didn't know would I think they mean linux th e OS, Red Hat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linux, a VA Linux workstation, a VA Linux server, a Pocket Linux system?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What the heck do they want to know?!  The Linux trademark is very very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; polluted now, what if I went out and made a killer win32 jabber client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and called it Linux Thang.  Everyone takes to calling it Linux and I get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; millions upon millions of downloads, suddenly someone once again says
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Hey you got that new Linux yet?&quot;  Oh man, is that a kernel or the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; release I just made of my client.  Dang I'm stuck.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Summarize, I do not think that companies or anyone should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; freely use the word Jabber like that.  What I do think should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available is an easy to use process to receive a derivate certification
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mark from the trademark holder, or some other derivate mark that then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fully gives me the right to use the word, phrase, symbol whatever for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the spreading of my work or ideas.  Jabber is something amazing, and it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really should be available to all and be allowed to easily spread and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; become the de facto IM standard.  I really do _not_ want it to become
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another word that has absolutely no meaning and solidarity, because that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't let us achieve what we want.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; people, not the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; ludicrous in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; These are mundane tasks, and basically no one will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; ever step up to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; plate.  I have, and even I feel it sucks.  I get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; bored and lose interest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; in them for a while, and eventually come back.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This shows my point, Temas.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; People obviously aren't willing to do the mundane
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; tasks.  Jabber.com comes along, and makes some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; progress on this, but still there are only 5 &quot;core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dudes&quot; making progress in getting things out.  (your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; words)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If other corporations besides Jabber.com are allowed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to get involved, they can put resources and money into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this as well.  But other corporations are being told
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; by Jabber.com not to mention Jabber in their company
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; names, product names, domain names, etc, thus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; deflecting them away from Jabber and away from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; contributing to Jabber.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Also, I think more volunteer Jabber programmers &amp; tech
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; writers would get involved if there was the potential
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of several corporations possibly hiring them, not just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Jabber.com.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If you want more than 5 core dudes, make Jabber OPEN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for real!
