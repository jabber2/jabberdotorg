<PRE>We wanted to invite everyone to the up-and-coming JabberCon 2001 in Keystone
this August 20th and 21st. 

If you have anything to do with Jabber, you don't want to miss this event!
Individuals from many companies have already signed up, including Cable and
Wireless, IBM and France Telecom. Details of the event can be found at
www.jabbercon.com or in a PDF file located at:
<A HREF="http://www.jabbercon.com/jabbercon2001.pdf">http://www.jabbercon.com/jabbercon2001.pdf</A>

If you have a product or service based on Jabber, JabberCon will be the
place to show it off. Otherwise, if you wish to either participate or give
your own session, feel free to contact us early and we'll get you on the
calendar. 

Attendance is limited and will be granted first come, first serve. 

Thanks!
The Entire Jabber.com Team

P.S. Here at Jabber.com, we're committed to helping as many people as
possible get to the event, but our ability to sponsor individuals is
obviously limited. If you are an open source contributor and do not have
financial support from an existing company, you may qualify for assistance
through discounts or other means of sponsorship. Contact <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bmoses at jabber.com</A>
to have your name added to a list.
