<PRE>I agree with the need to separate the Jabber protocol
from the Linux server implementation, as discussed in
this group recently.  Many companies are interested in
the Jabber protocol, but the open source Linux code
isn't too useful because Windows, Java, Python, etc...
can't use it.

One major problem I've seen is Jabber.com's trademark
of the name &quot;Jabber&quot;.  Several companies I've run
across were asked by Jabber.com to remove &quot;Jabber&quot;
from their names.

Is Jabber.com the only commercial company allowed to
use the word &quot;Jabber&quot; for their company names and
products?  This is not fair.

The name &quot;Jabber&quot; should be similar to &quot;Linux&quot;, in
that any company can use it in naming products,
websites or companies.  If Jabber.com can prevent
other corporations from using the term &quot;Jabber&quot;, it
will greatly limit the progress of Jabber technology.

&gt;<i>From what I've discovered, &quot;Jabber&quot; was used in the
</I>public domain long before Webb Interactive came along
and trademarked the name.  

Who coined the name Jabber originally?  

Was it immediately trademarked before being used as a
public open source project?  

Did Jabber.com buy the name from someone?

Did Jabber.org make an exclusive agreement with a
single corporation (Jabber.com) to use the name
Jabber?

If anyone could explain why Jabber.com has a legal
trademark on the name &quot;Jabber&quot;, and why they prevent
other commercial organizations from using &quot;Jabber&quot; in
their company or product names, please let me know.
