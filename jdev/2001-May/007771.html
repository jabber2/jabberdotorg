<PRE>Having returned from vacation I'm back to implementing 
groupchat/conferencing in my client. At this point I'm still very 
confused about which version of the protocol to implement. I started by 
following the Group Chat Overview in the JPG, was told that was obsolete 
and to use the new Generic Conferencing protocol, but was then told by 
some other people that is not ready for use yet. However, the 
Conferencing section of the 1.4 Server How-To, and D J Adams's groupchat 
roundup document both say that the 1.4 server supports generic 
conferencing.

So what's going on here? Which chat/conference protocol can I use with 
the 1.4 server?

With regard to the old groupchat protocol, one thing I'm still 
scratching my head over is how you create a chat room. The JPG doesn't 
say anything about that, only how to enter an existing room. Do you just 
make up a room name and send presence to it as though it already 
existed? Or [god forbid] do rooms have to be set up in advance by server 
admins?

Thanks as always,

&#8212;Jens
