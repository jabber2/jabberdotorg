But jabber.com's server is advertised as being more scalable than the 
regular open source version you use!

Also, Todd had written that &quot;Jabberbot's roster on Jabber.com is about 
10 times the size of the next
largest user's roster&quot;, which leads me to guess that it had thousands, 
not hundreds, of &quot;from&quot; subscriptions.

I still don't understand why this would be any trouble for the server. 
All it means is that when the bot logs in or out, the server has to scan 
its roster and send out &lt;presence&gt; packets to all the subscribers who 
are currently logged in (and that's probably less than half, I'd guess.) 
If that brings the server to its knees, wouldn't that imply some kind of 
design problem?
