<PRE>The only thing which comes to mind right off the bat is that Redhat
installed kaffe, and it is being used instead of Sun's JDK. I have never
done testing with JabberBeans on kaffe.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello to the group,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I have a problem with a Java client that I have written and
</I>&gt;<i> was wondering if anyone else had run across a similar situation. As
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned in the subject line the client is written in Java. It uses
</I>&gt;<i> the JabberBeans framework (0.9.0-pre4) APIs as the basis for
</I>&gt;<i> communication with a Jabber server. The client works fine when run on
</I>&gt;<i> the WindowsNT 4.0 operating system. However, when run on Red Hat Linux
</I>&gt;<i> 6.2 the client is never connected to the server. The client sends the
</I>&gt;<i> correct username and password to the appropriate server but never
</I>&gt;<i> receives a connection notification from the server. No packets from
</I>&gt;<i> the server are ever received by my client after my client sends the
</I>&gt;<i> authentication packet. Has anyone else seen this type of problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you
</I>&gt;<i> Aubrey
