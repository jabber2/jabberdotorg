<PRE>Jabber has the potential to be much bigger than Jabber.com. It has the
potential to become the presence, instant messaging, real-time peer-to-peer
communication standard of the Internet, becoming as much a part of the net
as SMTP, DNS, and HTTP. I believe we will someday have a standard protocol
for this kind of communication, if not Jabber, at least something similar.

However, if you look at these other ubiquitous protocols, they're not tied
to any kind of branding or trademark restriction. People work to keep their
software compatible because of professional pride and a desire for their
product to work well, not for the sake of getting to display a logo. This
kind of tactic reminds me more of Sun's struggle to control Java while still
fostering community involvement. Although Java is successful (I'm speaking
as a Java programmer, myself.) I think Sun's effort to control it has kept
it from being as widely adopted as it could have been. I'm not saying that
there's been no benefit from Sun's control of Java, but I do know of people
who don't use it solely because it is under Sun control.

The world is changing, and maybe Jabber.com will be the first to
successfully walk this tight-rope. Or maybe the protocol will develop a life
of it's own outside of Jabber.com, and may even shed the Jabebr name. It
will be interesting to watch.

Peace,
Greg

Hmm.  Yes.  I think it may be nice if/when we get true formalized protocol 
docs out to create compatibility tests (server and client).  A client that 
passes the test could use a &quot;powered by Jabber&quot; type of logo...  It would 
be up to jabber.com and the Foundation to decide if that would be the 
lightbulb or another logo...

Thoughts?
