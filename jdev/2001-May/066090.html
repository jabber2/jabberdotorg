<PRE>I've got conferencing and the MSN transport working. I found during the
configuration of the jabber.xml that formatting the tags (i.e., indenting)
is a no-no.

for example (from my notes), the following produces an error:

&lt;conference&gt;./conference-0.4.1/conference.so
&lt;/conference&gt;

Maybe I had a blank space after the .so or a carriage return. I don't know
but it works just fine like this:

&lt;conference&gt;./conference-0.4.1/conference.so&lt;/conference&gt;

Your best bet is not to assume anything about the formatting of the
jabber.xml file, use/modify the examples that comes with the
services/transports, and follow the directions precisely.

  Hello, Everyone,

  I'm having a good experience with the basic jabberd and got a local JUD
added with zero problem.  That was a Good Thing.

  I've since tried to add a conference, and AIM transport, and an ICQ
transport.  Each of these exercises have met with nothing but mysterious
messages like &quot;Not acceptable&quot; and &quot;Not Implemented&quot;.  The AIM transport
wouldn't compile at all, regardless of what the FAQ's and HowTo's said.

  I've checked every character of XML, verified it with the HOWTO and the
FAQ's, straightened away the indents so it looked pretty (with some servers,
neatness counts!), run the server in debug mode (which basically produces
zillions of useless lines) and by this point, IF I had hair, I'd be tearing
it out.

  Is there anyone who has actually gotten ICQ or conferencing to work?  I'm
running the server on both RH6.2 and RH7.1 with identical results.  That is,
the basic server comes up beautifully and JUD is a TREAT!  If that were all
I needed to work, I could be happy with that.

  I'm convinced there has GOT to be a config problem, but looking at the
docs and looking at what I've got in jabber.xml, they're near identical
(except for machine name, of course).  All the virtual machine names in the
id's are unique and present in DNS (both internal and external DNS's, that
is).  The FAQ's didn't have a whole lot to go on and I didn't find the other
documentation to be much help.  I've read everything I could get to on the
jabber.* sites...

  Could anyone share their experience in bringing up the latest version of
conferencing and/or ICQ transport?  I'd be a most grateful!!
