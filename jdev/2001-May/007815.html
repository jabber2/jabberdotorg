<PRE>Hallo Nic,

I have posted my configuration files for running the server both as a 
single process and for running it as multiple processes (i.e., separate 
processes for add-on services such as conferencing and the transports) 
on my site at <A HREF="http://jabber.to/xml/">http://jabber.to/xml/</A> -- however I have not updated these 
files in at least a few weeks and I know for a fact that the ICQ setup 
in single.xml there is incorrect (although the icqtrans.xml file for 
running the ICQ Transport as a separate process does work with the 
latest release). I would be happy to help you out as I have time to do 
so. Also please note that there is a dedicated mailing list for 
installing, configuring, and administering Jabber servers: it's called 
JADMIN and you can sign up at <A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/jadmin">http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/jadmin</A> 
(the JDEV list to which you have posted is supposed to be for discussion 
of software development with Jabber, not server administration).

Hope this helps.

Peter

</I>&gt;<i> can avoid wasting time and fraying my nerves trying to get things right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your time.
