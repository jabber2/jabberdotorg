<PRE>Mike -

One of the things that jabber browsing was supposed to do was to enable
clients to check for capabilities.. so my client would send an &lt;iq
type=&quot;get&quot; to=&quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">foo at jabber.org</A>/client&quot;&gt;&lt;query
xmlns=&quot;jabber:iq:browse&quot;/&gt;&lt;/iq&gt;, and the other client would respond to that
query with a list of all the namespaces that it supports, including the
elusive &quot;MYCLIENT:VOICE&quot; namespace :) So they your client would know what it
can do...

I'm working on implementing this right now in winjab, the obvious problem is
that if you don't get a response, you need to wait for a timeout or
something equally gross. This isn't the best way to handle this I think, but
its a very good start... It would help a lot if there was a &quot;query&quot;
mechanism built into the browsing protocol, so I could say to a specific
client &quot;do you support jabber:x:foo??&quot; instead of saying &quot;give me a complete
list of all namespaces you support&quot;.

Subject: Client Capabilities Namespace and RE: [JDEV] Jabber, the Name


&gt;<i> On the Naming Issue:
</I>&gt;<i> ================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was my understanding that the Jabber server, protocol and concept are
</I>&gt;<i> *not* in fact Jabber.com's stuff, but Jeremie's stuff that he was gracious
</I>&gt;<i> enough to add to the open source movement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this not correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the Client Compatibility Issue:
</I>&gt;<i> ========================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it has not already been discussed, it is my humble opinion that all
</I>&gt;<i> clients should be required to support at least a Query Capability XML
</I>packet
&gt;<i> and return a TRUE/FALSE when it receives it.  Additionally, a Get
</I>&gt;<i> Capabilities List packet would be nice, allowing the client to enumerate
</I>&gt;<i> supported capabilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I mean by this is that my jabber client should be able to send to any
</I>&gt;<i> online jabber client a query capability packet and ask that client if it
</I>&gt;<i> supports my voice format (specified by some unique string id that I made
</I>up,
&gt;<i> like &quot;MYCLIENT:VOICE&quot; that is probably used as an &lt;X /&gt; namespace. If it
</I>&gt;<i> returned true, my client could safely send it voice messages and know the
</I>&gt;<i> recipient can play them.  If false, I would disable the voice send feature
</I>&gt;<i> for that user in the buddy list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, the server could be expanded &lt;ick&gt; to store client
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities which could become of the login negotiation (since any client
</I>&gt;<i> can be run against any JID at any time, it would be necessary to do this
</I>on
&gt;<i> a per session basis.)  This has the added benefit of reducing capability
</I>&gt;<i> query traffic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, when I say &quot;packet&quot;, I'm referring to an XML message from a jabber
</I>&gt;<i> client to a jabber server, much like the presence message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With something such as this, anyone can arbitrarily add their own
</I>namespaces
&gt;<i> and easily determine which clients can and cannot support their custom
</I>&gt;<i> features (regardless of whether they are voice features, file transfer,
</I>&gt;<i> xhtml, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, just my humble opinion
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MikeE
</I>
