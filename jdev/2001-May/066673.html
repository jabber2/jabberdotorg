<PRE>I mean the sender of the key would sign the key (i.e. the keyserver).

If user A has their public key stored at keyserver X, X would have a signing
key that it would use to sign the public key of A each time a request was
served for A's key (so A's key is signed with X's signing key).

What I have in mind is slightly different to the signature used in X509
certs. The example is thus;

If user A wishes to store their public key at key servers X, Y, and Z (to
ensure it is always available) they can pass the information to each server
as they wish. When X, Y, or Z respond to a request for the key of A they can
respond with the information from A (the signature or X509 cert), and sign
it with their own key. That way if the user requesting the key for A can
tell the source of the key response (i.e. X, Y, or Z) and attach a level of
trust to it.

&gt;<i>From what I know X509's allow the issuer to add a signature, but don't have
</I>the scope to hold the identity of the keystore from which the key was
retrieved (which this method solves).

Does this make things a little clearer?

Al.
