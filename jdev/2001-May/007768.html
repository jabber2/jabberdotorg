<PRE>Just as a note that's what most of us are doing constantly ;-)  I'm
working on aim-t right now.

&gt;<i> Just as an outside observation (donning heavy, flame-retardant clothing), it

</I>&gt;<i> basic, core jabberd and JUD (the two of which are
</I>&gt;<i> dead-easy-work-first-time-no-brains-needed), none (NONE!) of the other
</I>&gt;<i> provided transports work and there's no CORRECT documentation to tell
</I>&gt;<i> someone how to do a few simple cookbook configs.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even more egregiously, there are no documents telling anyone how to
</I>&gt;<i> interpret debug messages.  No offence, but &quot;Merlin casts his spell&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> hardly useful as a diagnostic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or better yet, spend some time refining documentation, rather than kvetching
</I>&gt;<i> about the name.  If you guys really want the project to succeed (and I
</I>&gt;<i> FIRMLY believe that in time, it will), you might want to get your priorities
</I>&gt;<i> in order.  Solve the problems with transports, fix the docs, provide more
</I>&gt;<i> than very tiny, hastily-made, thumbnail HOWTO's; then worry about a
</I>&gt;<i> cute-n-catchy name.  Believe me, most of us will pick &quot;works&quot; over &quot;cute&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> any day.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As an ISP who really thinks that you have the start of a FANTASTIC product,
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say there's a lot more to go in before the name goes on.  PLEASE
</I>&gt;<i> don't fall into the M$ trap of coming up with a grand name, then have no
</I>&gt;<i> real performance behind it.  What you have in-hand thus far is MUCH too good
</I>&gt;<i> for that.  Respect the product, ensure that things that are supposed to be
</I>&gt;<i> in it WORK (and work together), and somebody PLEASE come up with some
</I>&gt;<i> documentation and support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure we're not the only ISP anxiously awaiting a full-plate offering,
</I>&gt;<i> complete with easily-configurable transports.  Most of us have a
</I>&gt;<i> passing-but-workable understanding of XML--that's not the problem.  Even _I_
</I>&gt;<i> can inspect a document for well-formedness (honest, I didn't sleep in XML
</I>&gt;<i> class! Well, not ALL the way through...).  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my defence, I've been configuring and compiling things for *nix for over
</I>&gt;<i> 20 years.  If a reasonably-versed person like myself is having a great deal
</I>&gt;<i> of trouble due to the paucity of &quot;What to do when it blows up&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, think of the poor Linux newbie.  You may as well throw
</I>&gt;<i> sendmail at 'em right out the box.  (Speaking of things that sorely need
</I>&gt;<i> proper documentation!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is in when we attempt to configure things that would add REAL
</I>&gt;<i> VALUE to the product.  Those external transports ARE real value from a
</I>&gt;<i> small, independent ISP's viewpoint.  When the configs parse correctly
</I>&gt;<i> (jabberd doesn't complain, that is) and are entered exactly as the example
</I>&gt;<i> states (machine names excepted, of course) and the transport still doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> work, there are NO diagnostics to tell us what we did wrong.  &quot;Not
</I>&gt;<i> configured&quot; as an error message, when we can clearly see configs in the
</I>&gt;<i> proper place (according to the slim HOWTO) and in the documented format,
</I>&gt;<i> isn't a lot of help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Running the jabberd in debug mode doesn't really help.  At no time did any
</I>&gt;<i> ONE process complain of ill configuration with a message along the lines of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hey, Stupid, fix &lt;xxx/&gt; in the config and this might work next time&quot;.  As
</I>&gt;<i> much diagnostic as we were able to glean was &quot;returning unhandled&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What was returning from where and why fillintheblank was unhandled, no clue
</I>&gt;<i> was given.  If you want Jabber to catch on and be the thing to steamroll ICQ
</I>&gt;<i> and AIM for flexibility and utility (it could, it could!), then there's a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of setup work left to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Folks, I'd really like to see the Jabber project continue to evolve.  Rather
</I>&gt;<i> than waste bandwidth on picking names and logos, we might want to focus on
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;what would make Jabber the next Ubiquitous Product On Every Desktop&quot;.  Like
</I>&gt;<i> diagnostics and config help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What can we do to pitch in and help?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With deepest respect,

</I>&gt;<i> Check out what Jabber.com has to say about the Jabber

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> why the Jabber Foundation is a great thing and the
