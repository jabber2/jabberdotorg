I don't think this last item is there. the LITERAL token (for elements which
are not in the DTD) reports an offset in the string table, meaning it needs to
be defined beforehand and not inline.

You would either need to make an altered standard allowing this, or have each
element in the stream be a separate document, so that you can declare extra
elements beforehand. If the goal is to save as much space as possible, I would
recommend an altered standard so that declarations of new namespaces can be
kept over the course of the entire session.

I really doubt this would simplify parsing (either in terms of execution speed
or in Lines of Code). If you didn't &quot;decompress&quot; the binary format before
sending it into Jabber, it would require substantial changes which would pretty
much encompass every line of code. You would also need to retain much more
state on the session in order to be able to convert to the binary format,
especially if you had an 'evolving' dictionary; that would increase memory
usage per user.

However, there is still plenty of merit in trying this, and it would probably
be something that someone providing IM to a ton of users would love, because it
would greatly reduce their operating cost due to bandwidth.
