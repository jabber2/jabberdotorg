<PRE>On the Naming Issue:
================

It was my understanding that the Jabber server, protocol and concept are
*not* in fact Jabber.com's stuff, but Jeremie's stuff that he was gracious
enough to add to the open source movement.

Is this not correct?

On the Client Compatibility Issue:
========================

If it has not already been discussed, it is my humble opinion that all
clients should be required to support at least a Query Capability XML packet
and return a TRUE/FALSE when it receives it.  Additionally, a Get
Capabilities List packet would be nice, allowing the client to enumerate
supported capabilities.

What I mean by this is that my jabber client should be able to send to any
online jabber client a query capability packet and ask that client if it
supports my voice format (specified by some unique string id that I made up,
like &quot;MYCLIENT:VOICE&quot; that is probably used as an &lt;X /&gt; namespace. If it
returned true, my client could safely send it voice messages and know the
recipient can play them.  If false, I would disable the voice send feature
for that user in the buddy list.

Alternatively, the server could be expanded &lt;ick&gt; to store client
capabilities which could become of the login negotiation (since any client
can be run against any JID at any time, it would be necessary to do this on
a per session basis.)  This has the added benefit of reducing capability
query traffic.

BTW, when I say &quot;packet&quot;, I'm referring to an XML message from a jabber
client to a jabber server, much like the presence message.

With something such as this, anyone can arbitrarily add their own namespaces
and easily determine which clients can and cannot support their custom
features (regardless of whether they are voice features, file transfer,
xhtml, etc.)

Once again, just my humble opinion

MikeE

What do you mean by compatibility test for client? It must support ALL
the features of protocol? There is a lot of clients that don't implement
them all, especially file transfer or XHTML.
I think, we should choose some features for the test, the only problem
I see is what actually should we choose ;). Any ideas?

By the way: in my opinion the best solution should be to leave Jabber.com
with
the logo and &quot;Jabber&quot; name and invent something else for the community.
Unfortunately for us all, Dixon Canario is right (even if I don't like that
he treated us like the &quot;sons of #@%!%&quot;):  &quot;it is open source, but it
is still their stuff&quot;.

It was my two words to the discussion. Thank you ;)
