Subject: Re: [JDEV] Request for comments on system using jabber
&gt;&gt;<i> But jabber.com's server is advertised as being more scalable than the
</I>regular open source version you use!

    Well, thats not my realm, I don't work for them..  8-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, Todd had written that &quot;Jabberbot's roster on Jabber.com is about 10
</I>times the size of the next
&gt;&gt;<i> largest user's roster&quot;, which leads me to guess that it had thousands,
</I>not hundreds, of &quot;from&quot; subscriptions.
&gt;&gt;<i> I still don't understand why this would be any trouble for the server.
</I>All it means is that when the bot logs in or out, the server has to scan its
roster and send out &lt;presence&gt; packets to all the subscribers who are
&gt;&gt;<i> currently logged in (and that's probably less than half, I'd guess.) If
</I>that brings the server to its knees, wouldn't that imply some kind of design
problem?

    Yes.  The problem is, the typical c2s componenent takes some things for
granted, namely, one of them being, that it won't take a tremendouse amount
of work to do some things.  In the case of a jabber 'bot', that bot should
actually be written as a transport and *NOT* as a client connecting to the
c2s component.

    Look at it this way.  You don't see any large companies handling their
email routing by setting up Outlook Express with a crapload of delivery
rules.  You have an entire email 'system' for handling them.  c2s is just
that, client 2 server, and IMHO, the design flaw here is that JabberBot
shouldn't be a client.  It should be a server.
