<PRE>Getting to JabberCon 2001: A Call for Developers

The following was posted by <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">stpeter at jabber.org</A> via the Jabber DevZone web site (<A HREF="http://dev.jabber.org/">http://dev.jabber.org/</A>):

Hi, stpeter here. As many in the Jabber community know, I happen to
work for Jabber.com. We (here I put on my corporate hat) are
sponsoring a gathering of people and companies who are working with
Jabber, which we're calling JabberCon 2001 (see JabberCon.com). This
conference will be held on August 20 and 21 in the mountains of
Colorado, and we're expecting that it will bring together some of the
best minds in the Jabber community for discussions, learning, personal
interaction, and just plain fun.


To make this conference all that it can be, we want to get as many
members of the open-source community to the gathering as we can.
Unfortunately, we realize that not everyone can get their employer to
pay for the cost of attending, or even has an employer in the first
place. :-) So we would like to sponsor the attendance of as many
open-source developers as we can.


Obviously Jabber.com has limited resources and can't afford travel and
lodging expenses for everyone in the Jabber community, much as we
would like to. However, if you want to be at JabberCon -- to show off
a Jabber application you've written, to give a talk or run a
birds-of-a-feather session, to learn from the Jabber gurus who will be
there -- then we want to hear from you. Once we know how many people
from the open-source community want to attend, we will do what it
takes (e.g., by recruiting additional conference sponsors) to ensure
that as many members of the community as possible can participate in
this first-ever Jabber community event.


If you would like be partially or fully sponsored for JabberCon,
please send an email to me (Peter Saint-Andre) at <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">stpeter at jabber.org</A>
and tell me a little about what you've done with Jabber and why you
would like to participate. I'll collect all the responses for review
by Andre Durand, General Manager of Jabber.com, who will make the
final decisions. And if you have any questions, as always I'm just a
Jabber message away at <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">stpeter at jabber.org.</A>


Thanks for your interest, and happy Jabbering!
