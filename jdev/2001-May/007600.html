Quicker to prototype and test new capabilities, for one. Lots
of XML libs/tools for another. Python works best as a glue
scripting language between components.

&gt;<i>   save for its multiplatform capabilities. But, I must

</I>
That's why I mentioned calling C binaries from Python or
language X if needed. Also, performance may not be a priority.
I can imagine using the jabber server for other tasks besides
IM chatting.

</I>&gt;<i>   a) useful

Oh yeah? Moldy bread.

&gt;<i>   This demands the inside-out reworking of the Jabber server
</I>&gt;<i>   in a variety of languages, and the development of alternate
</I>&gt;<i>   servers that can &quot;anticipate&quot; future changes to Jabber
</I>&gt;<i>   internal protocols and such.
</I>
Interesting. Kinda like Apache httpd's DSO modules.

&gt;<i>   Now - the ability to change certain server behaviors does
</I>&gt;<i>   make itself attractive, and is a pretty compelling argument
</I>&gt;<i>   for implementing Jabber in other languages, but I'm not
</I>&gt;<i>   sure there aren't simply better ways around this, particularly
</I>&gt;<i>   ones that don't require wholesale server rewrite whenever
</I>&gt;<i>   fundamental changes in the default Jabber server occur.
</I>
I'm getting confused... didn't you just say something to the
contrary before this? And don't you mean &quot;protocol&quot; instead
of your last use of &quot;server&quot; in the above paragraph?
If so, agreed, server rewrites for protocol changes is icky. 

&gt;<i>   I think the focus of current server developers should be
</I>&gt;<i>   to first document all internal protocols - (s2s and xdb
</I>&gt;<i>   being fine examples), and then to worry about making
</I>&gt;<i>   Jabber as portable as possible. I've got a pretty hefty
</I>&gt;<i>   RS6K sitting next to my desk begging to run Jabber, but
</I>&gt;<i>   even IBM's porting efforts have only been partially
</I>&gt;<i>   successful.
</I>
Yup, you are correct. St. Peter mentioned that this work is
being done. Bring out the cat o' nine tails.

&gt;<i>   Which, in many ways - is a pretty strong argument for
</I>&gt;<i>   much more platform-agnostic languages (perl, python,
</I>&gt;<i>   java), but I think we need to look at Apache as a good
</I>&gt;<i>   model.
</I>
Are you skipping on your Lithium again?

&gt;<i>   Yes, I know that Apache is only a server (well not so
</I>&gt;<i>   much these days) and Jabber is a set of related technologies, but
</I>&gt;<i>   I feel that making the current Jabber server as fast/friendly/portable
</I>&gt;<i>   as possible is the real key here, and maintaining a variety of
</I>&gt;<i>   separate server implementations would be...
</I>
Jabber = related technologies? That's not what I thought Jer had in mind.

&gt;<i>   On second thought - David Waite's right - we have to look at separating
</I>&gt;<i>   protocol from server implementation.
</I>
My point all along. Apache has the W3C. What does Jabber have? Do we
need a separate jabber protocol effort separate from the server devel effort?

&gt;<i>   You know - I just contradicted myself.
</I>
I'm getting used to it.
