<PRE>The conference/groupchat server will post user-visible messages about 
people joining/leaving the chat room, e.g. &quot;jens has arrived.&quot; These are 
problematic for several reasons:

(1) They are localized by the server, not the client, so they don't 
necessarily match the language used by the client or by the rest of the 
conversation in the chat room.
(2) They refer to people by their nicknames; by contrast, my client is 
going to make efforts to look up real names and use those in its UI 
whenever possible (unless the chat room disallows this.)
(3) They assume the client's GUI wants to use text messages to indicate 
people joining or leaving.  While this is true of the boring old textual 
chat UI that everyone uses, I have different ideas and these messages 
are getting in my way.

For the above reasons I would like my client to just ignore these 
messages and manage its own UI for showing people joining/leaving. 
However, I'm worried that the server may send out messages for other 
reasons either now or in the future. Are there any other types of 
messages that the chat room sends by itself, which I may not want to 
drop on the floor and kick into the corner?
