As wasted pointed out, there are current projects like JAM (<A HREF="http://jabber.org/?oid=532">http://jabber.org/?oid=532</A>) and xdb_java (<A HREF="http://xdbjava.sourceforge.net/">http://xdbjava.sourceforge.net/</A>) (Hey Matt! Get busy! :)
that are pointing towards the same goal as you. Check the JDEV archives for &quot;xdb_java&quot; for more info.

When you ask &quot;Should they really be retreived from the Application Server&quot;, do you mean the auth data as an object?
Sounds interesting. And it brings up some ideas I've had.

I've been wondering why the Jabber Server hasn't been implemented in other languages such as Java or Python with
C calls to the appropriate libs. It seems that multiple server platform implementations could only help in the adoption of Jabber.
I mean, wouldn't the Jabber Server running under Apache Tomcat be really, really cool? If Jabber is not just a chat protocol,
then performance/scalability is not a priority. Suitability of the jabber protocol to the task at hand is the priority.

IMHO, the ultimate aim is the widespread adoption of the Jabber protocol and not the current server implementation. Right, Jer?
