<PRE>Greetings All,

I apologize if it's inappropriate to post this here.  It's not spam, I'm
just trying to help a friend out who's looking for a programmer with
some specific skills.

My JabID is <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">CaptainVideo at jabber.org</A> - I'm not developing for jabber or
anything like that, but I lurk on this list and in the jdev conference.
You are all doing some really awesome work.  Thanx.

Now for the off-topic topic:  A friend of mine dropped me an email
yesterday looking for some programming help - He's looking for an XML /
XSL experienced programmer and asked if I knew anyone.  I told him I
didn't know anyone personally, but I knew about this list full of gurus
and that we could perhaps locate someone for him  :-)

So, here's the deal as I understand it - everything's a bit hush, hush,
so at the moment I don't have all the info myself:

What's needed is a freelance XML / XSL experienced programmer for doing
some website backend stuff ASAP.

The job is for a record company.

The project was described as &quot;large in scale&quot; with the following needs::

&quot;Back-end programming to make the site functional.  Specifically,
integrating costomer-driven database backended system seamlessly
so that everything appears in HTML to
the consumer, but has the strength of XML (if I understand it correctly)
[&quot;The
style-sheets transform the XML data into HTML pages. XSL style-sheets
therefore serve as page templates. For example, a single XSL style-sheet
could
serve as the templates for hundreds of artist pages on a single site.&quot;].

I.E., having the tour database spit into the artist's site the tour info
in
the relevant spot of the template, etc.  Also, there would be a &quot;mailing
list&quot;
function to update fans on auto-pilot.&quot;

&quot;It is highly recommended, although not mandatory, that the Vendor also
have
deep knowledge of the following:
* JHTML/Java
* Oracle (for custom applications)
* Doubleclick Ad Server
* Ultraseek Search Engine
* Streaming Media formats (Real, Win, Quicktime) &quot;

The first part of the description sounds like a simple stylesheet /
design issue, but my guess is that the actual job entails connecting the
clients dynamic database of content to a website - via cgi / php / SQL /
etc. / whatever.

The Project bid/Proposal is due very soon. Back end work would probably
start in a
month or so and go for at least three months.  It could be bid as an
independent
contractor, or if you are associated with a contracting company,
the bid could go under their name.  The client contracting the job to
you would be the independent
contractor for the design portion of the project.

That's all I have for info on the gig.  Initial contact is to be handled
through kevin @ <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">kander208 at hotmail.com</A> - That email address will only be
valid for about a day or so as they are looking to move on this quickly.

Thanx.   sk....
