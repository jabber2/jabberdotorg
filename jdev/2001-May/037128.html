<PRE>&lt;grin&gt; I'm no C programmer, but I'd be willing to help with testing and
documentation.  We normally have a couple of systems upon which we could
carve, chop, test, slice, dice, and serve.  We also have a nice collection
of folks who would be willing to play along with us, using the system and
various transports to see what works well now and what is left in our
collective &quot;to-do&quot; lists.

Nic and I are really sincere about lending a hand.  We've tested several
servers and clients, but ONLY Jabber with either Everybuddy or JIM will work
with software that interprets screen data for blind people.  NO other chat
transport is as willing to get along with interpreting software (not that
we've found anyway!) 

We donate free web space and services to organisations who support people
with disabilities (we only ask for proof of 501(c)(?) status or the
equivalent in their country).  Since we donate a lot of time, space, and
services, we look for software that is (1) easy to install and maintain, (2)
offer something of real value to a community who desperately need it, (3)
interoperable with something else either on our systems or with other
systems, and (4) (because we're a small and struggling ISP) it has to be
cheap or free.  Everything about Jabber (the protocol, the server, and the
clients) fits this bill.

We're really excited about the whole project, because at the end of the day,
we see where people who really want, need, and deserve parity on the 'net
can have it.  Yes, we're a bit frustrated at the state of the docs, but
we're willing to roll up sleeves and pitch in rather just squat on the
sidelines bitching.  Bitching gets none of us anywhere :-)

Teamwork will, though.  Our hats are off to the entire JDev team for hanging
in and constantly refining the product.

Most respectfully,
Bill

Just as a note that's what most of us are doing constantly ;-)  I'm
working on aim-t right now.
