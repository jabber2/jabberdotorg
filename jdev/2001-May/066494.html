<PRE>Jens, I completely agree on all 3 points.  Hopefully the final conferencing
protocol will work some other way.  The current draft seems like its just
IRC wrapped into jabber, sans the ping/pong.

Subject: [JDEV] Server-generated conference messages are a problem



The conference/groupchat server will post user-visible messages about people
joining/leaving the chat room, e.g. &quot;jens has arrived.&quot; These are
problematic for several reasons: 


(1) They are localized by the server, not the client, so they don't
necessarily match the language used by the client or by the rest of the
conversation in the chat room. 

(2) They refer to people by their nicknames; by contrast, my client is going
to make efforts to look up real names and use those in its UI whenever
possible (unless the chat room disallows this.) 

(3) They assume the client's GUI wants to use text messages to indicate
people joining or leaving. While this is true of the boring old textual chat
UI that everyone uses, I have different ideas and these messages are getting
in my way. 


For the above reasons I would like my client to just ignore these messages
and manage its own UI for showing people joining/leaving. However, I'm
worried that the server may send out messages for other reasons either now
or in the future. Are there any other types of messages that the chat room
sends by itself, which I may not want to drop on the floor and kick into the
corner?
