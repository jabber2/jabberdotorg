<PRE>As a note there is a draft for dynamic forms in Jabber, and I have
implemented it in vorpex (the new website system).  Part of the idea is
that if a client doesn't understand the forms system they could point
the user OOB to access the forms.

</I>&gt;<i> parse, or am I wrong? Anyway, I agree with Jens that this seems to be a
</I>&gt;<i> major problem - client or transport the server should be able to happily
</I>&gt;<i> deal with large scale presence notifications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Command syntax: Yeah, well I see this could be a problem. We can either
</I>&gt;<i> continue using natural language for this, which is improving all the time
</I>&gt;<i> but does have problems (as in: it can be difficult to know exactly what or
</I>&gt;<i> how you can do with the commands/varied syntax) or we can use some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> controlled input system like HTML forms only different. Here's my suggestion
</I>&gt;<i> (I'll prototype it when I can):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bots advertise themselves as supporting the commands syntax somehow (in
</I>&gt;<i> presence?) and when a client that supports it beings &quot;chatting&quot; to this bot,
</I>&gt;<i> what actually happens is that a special message is sent to the bot
</I>&gt;<i> requesting the data (or it could be an IQ get/set system). This returns some
</I>&gt;<i> XML representing the commands that can be used, which are displayed to the
</I>&gt;<i> user as a series of linked phrases, like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (i'll use the freshmeat news example here)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Start chat
</I>&gt;<i> * A window appears that looks like this, here [] means blue underlined text
</I>&gt;<i> like hyperlinks
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [select option]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The user clicks on the [select option] link and a menu appears with the
</I>&gt;<i> Watch and Ignore commands, and maybe others like About etc.
</I>&gt;<i> * The user chooses Watch
</I>&gt;<i> * The window changes to read
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From now on, send me updates on the (edit) news source.
</I>&gt;<i> [ and ]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The (edit) is just a text edit so we can type in the words we want. The
</I>&gt;<i>  and ] link gives us more options, like &quot;and, send me a daily digest&quot;, &quot;and,
</I>&gt;<i> send me XHTML formatted news items&quot; etc. The user wants both of these
</I>&gt;<i> options, so they click the first [and], then choose the option, so it reads
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From now on, send me updates on the (edit) news source,
</I>&gt;<i> and send it as a daily digest,
</I>&gt;<i> [ and ]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... then ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From now on, send me updates on the (edit) news source,
</I>&gt;<i> and send it as a daily digest,
</I>&gt;<i> and send it as XHTML formatted
</I>&gt;<i> [ and ]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now the user has created a request that identifies their needs to the bot,
</I>&gt;<i> so they click OK or whatever and another XML message is sent to the bot with
</I>&gt;<i> the data the user entered. The bot returns a text message saying, &quot;Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> for using PersonalBuddy, I will:  send you updates on the (edit) news
</I>&gt;<i> source, and send it as a daily digest, and send it as XHTML formatted.&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> let the user know it went OK. The same interface can be used to unsubscribe
</I>&gt;<i> :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [ select option ]   &gt;   Unsubscribe   &gt;    [ select news feed ]    &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Freshmeat.net   &gt;  OK
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I know this approach has some problems, most notably client support
</I>&gt;<i> is required which sort of does away with the whole point of IM bots which is
</I>&gt;<i> that they are like other people and all you need is the IM software, but  I
</I>&gt;<i> believe it -is- powerful and flexible. Also I suppose that for clients that
</I>&gt;<i> didn't support this or didn't want to use it (ie sent the bot a plain text
</I>&gt;<i> message) it could go to the natural language interface. Anyway, comments
</I>&gt;<i> anyone?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks -mike
