what exactly did you do to have it work ? We just try with pth-
1.4.0 but without success :
- if we build pth-1.4.0 as a library installed in /usr/local 
when compiling jabber it complains for 2 missing symbols
- if you modify the Makefile inside jabberd to use only pth-
1.4.0 it compiles fine but seems to crash later while 
running after receiving an incoming authentification (we 
comment out the changes in mio.c)

If we leave our initial code in mio.c then it works exactly the 
same way as with pth-1.3.7.
Were you able to have some clients connected to your 
server ? Or did you just run the server without any 
connections (which is what it looks like).

You have to understand that the small modifications in 
mio.c have a huge impact on the server behavior. Without 
the pth_usleep() and the pth_yield() the server will crash 
almost after receiving an authentification or account 
creation request. 
Without those changes the server can start but will not 
work really long. We absolutly need to have someone in 
the core team to look at the problem in order to fix it 
definitly.


Otherwise to answer your question : in order to create an 
account, you should either use JabberIM on Windows (see 
jabber.com), or open a telnet session on your server and 
send the right XML to create an account. After that you can 
switch to Fire.app.

I have built  and installed pth-1.4.0. &quot;make test&quot; returns 
eveything 
&quot;OK&quot;. Make sure to build
WITHOUT &quot;-O2&quot; set.

In using pth-1.4, I was able to get rid of the MACOSX 
changes involving 
the pth calls.

I then updated platform-settings as follows:
	#PSUBDIR=pth-1.3.7
	#PLINK=$(HOME)/jabberd/pth-1.3.7/pth_*.o
	PLINK=-L/usr/local/lib -lpth

I also moved pth-1.3.7 out of the way and did a &quot;make 
static&quot;. 
Everything seems to have built fine.

It runs but I don't know what to do to connect to it with a 
client 
(Fire.app).
