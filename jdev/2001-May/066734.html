<PRE>David,

Thank you for your response. I am using the Sun JDK 1.2.2. It seems to be
something going on at the socket layer. I am able send the client
initializing info to the server but I don't get a response back from the
server. Do you know if any one has written and run a Java Jabber client on
Linux??

The only thing which comes to mind right off the bat is that Redhat
installed kaffe, and it is being used instead of Sun's JDK. I have never
done testing with JabberBeans on kaffe.

have a problem with a Java client that I have written and was wondering
if anyone else had run across a similar situation. As mentioned in the
subject line the client is written in Java. It uses the JabberBeans
framework
(0.9.0-pre4) APIs as the basis for communication with a Jabber server.
The client works fine when run on the WindowsNT 4.0 operating system.
However,
when run on Red Hat Linux 6.2 the client is never connected to the server.
The client sends the correct username and password to the appropriate server
but never receives a connection notification from the server. No packets
from the server are ever received by my client after my client sends the
authentication packet. Has anyone else seen this type of
problem?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
