<PRE>Foundation Meeting Summary

The following was posted by <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">stpeter at jabber.org</A> via the Jabber DevZone web site (<A HREF="http://dev.jabber.org/">http://dev.jabber.org/</A>):

Meeting Summary
The main points discussed in the meeting were as follows:



The Jabber Foundation will be similar to the Apache Foundation, except
that membership in the Jabber Foundation will be more open (Apache is
invitation-only).
Membership in the Jabber Foundation will be free. You will not have to
pay any money to be a member. However, membership will be based on
merit: members will be people who are actively contributing to the
Jabber community (by writing software, creating documentation, running
Jabber servers, participating on the mailing lists, etc.), not just
people who have expressed an interest in the technology. New members
must be accepted by the existing membership of the Foundation. How
exactly this will work at the beginning (i.e., right now there are no
members) is yet to be determined. We will probably accept just about
any active participant in the Jabber community at first. An
application page for this purpose will be made available in the new
few days.
In addition to regular Members, the Foundation will also solicit the
involvement of Sponsors, which will be corporations that make a
monetary contribution to support the operations of the Foundation.
Sponsors will *not* receive special consideration with regard to
technical discussions that occur within the Foundation, although they
may receive promotional opportunities for marketing purposes and
such.
The Foundation will be led by a Board of Directors, which will
initially consist of Jeremie Miller, Michael Bauer (VP of Open
Alliances at Jabber.com), and three additional board members who are
currently being recruited. The Board will not make technical decisions
for Jabber, but will manage external relationships and set up the
structure by which Members of the Foundation (probably in the form of
Jabber Interest Groups) will make technical decisions.
No more than 15% of the membership may come from any one
organization.
The point of the Foundation (above and beyond the existing jabber.org)
is primarily to open up decision-making with regard to the technical
direction of the Jabber protocol and community, and secondarily to
enable jabber.org to have an independent source of funding (through
sponsorships) so it can provide infrastructure (e.g., dedicated test
machines) that will benefit the Jabber community as a whole.

Next Meeting
The next scheduled meeting for discussion related to the Jabber
Foundation will be held in the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">foundation at conference.jabber.org</A> room
this Wednesday, the 9th of May, at 18:00 UTC/GMT (the same time of day
as the last meeting). If meeting at this time of day is a problem for
you, please inform Peter Saint-Andre (email/JID: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">stpeter at jabber.org</A>),
since we are open to meeting at different times of day in order to
accommodate the maximum number of interested participants.
