Subject: Re: [JDEV] Jabber, the Name


&gt;<i> I want to very very strongly restate what Peter said.... The lack of
</I>&gt;<i> powerful transports and document ation is because of people, not the
</I>&gt;<i> corporations, and suggesting otherwise is a bit ludicrous in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> These are mundane tasks, and basically no one will ever step up to the
</I>&gt;<i> plate.  I have, and even I feel it sucks.  I get bored and lose interest
</I>&gt;<i> in them for a while, and eventually come back.  I mean seriously, I've
</I>&gt;<i> been working on aim transport for what 2+ years now.  I haven't even
</I>&gt;<i> seen a spec of someone saying, &quot;hey can I help you?&quot;  All I hear is,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;this doesn't work, that doesn't work&quot;, &quot;When's the next release&quot;, &quot;AOL
</I>&gt;<i> blocked us again, are you fixing it?&quot;  To put it bluntly, it's
</I>&gt;<i> discouraging, very discouraging at times.  I keep doing it though
</I>&gt;<i> because I know people want it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Documentation is the same way.  Eliot Landrum and I were just having a
</I>&gt;<i> conversation this morning about how we've seen a ton of people start to
</I>&gt;<i> step up to the plate and say hey, we're going to help document.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> they're gone.  2 years, and it's still Eliot, Peter and myself that
</I>&gt;<i> primarily work on docs.  What is that?  People complain constantly and
</I>&gt;<i> the project gets constant grief over it, but we've been working on a
</I>&gt;<i> hundred and one projects with a core group of maybe 5 dudes to get this
</I>&gt;<i> all out.  Some things just fall on the wayside.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong, I'm not about to start preaching that &quot;if you don't
</I>&gt;<i> like it fix it&quot; line, because I personally don't believe in it.  Yes
</I>&gt;<i> that's always an option, but that doesn't get you devoted people, it
</I>&gt;<i> just gets you quick fixes that are incomplete to the problem.  What
</I>&gt;<i> needs to happen (and is being worked on) is a solid structure to get
</I>&gt;<i> people involved.  I would point to docs-dev to see that starting to
</I>&gt;<i> happen for the docs project, and to jabelin for server development, as
</I>&gt;<i> well as the foundation for protocol development.  We're trying our
</I>&gt;<i> hardest now, and I think it's going to pay off very shortly now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the issue of the Jabber name we talked about this extensively when
</I>&gt;<i> jer and I were up at Jabber.Com last time.  Peter has touched on some of
</I>&gt;<i> the points we discussed there but I haven't seen anything directly on
</I>&gt;<i> here from it.  I guess Bauer and Jer want to discuss this tomorrow in
</I>&gt;<i> the Foundation meeting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope that sheds some light on my views and thoughts about the issues
</I>&gt;<i> besides the actuall Jabber name.
