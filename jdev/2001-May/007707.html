<PRE>I agree with you Flora that it is a problem that Jabber.com have a trademark 
on the name &quot;Jabber&quot;. It certainly could cause confusion for anyone who 
wanted to create a site/company with Jabber in the name. IANAL, but I was 
under the impression that English language words could not be trademarked, 
but I'm sure someone will correct me on this :-)

I personally think that Jer should own the &quot;Jabber&quot; trademark (if it's 
actually valid at all), just as Linus owns the &quot;Linux&quot; trademark, and that 
the Jabber Foundation, when it kicks in, should be responsible for protecting 
Jer's interests in the trademark, just as Linux International ( www.li.org ) 
protects Linus's interests. I'm presuming here that Jer would actually want 
to own the trademark. Sorry if I'm presuming wrongly Jer :-)

I'm not going to judge Jabber.com on this before they've had a chance to 
comment though. Maybe transferring the trademark to the foundation was their 
intention all along. So, I guess this is a call for Jabber.com to outline 
their intentions and their position on the trademark issue. (And I know that 
the JDEV mailing list is technically not the most appropriate place for this 
discussion, but it does seem to be the one monitored by all the appropriate 
people!)

Just to state the obvious here; the Jabber (.org) project was founded well 
before Webb took an interest and formed Jabber.com. The two are completely 
separate entities. &quot;If&quot; (and it's a really big &quot;if&quot;) Jabber.com were to start 
throwing corporate weight about with their trademark, then the answer I'm 
sure would be to simply rename the project. That's one of the benefits of the 
Open Source world; it cannot be controlled by corporate interests and we can 
call projects whatever we like ;-)

Cheers,
Sean
