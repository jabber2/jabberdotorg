By &quot;mundane&quot; I gather you mean documentation and
transport fixes like you mentioned previously.  I
assumed Jabber.com was paying people to work on these
things, and that progress has been made due to
Jabber.com's involvement.  I also assumed new people
have joined the Jabber movement &quot;since the beginning&quot;
and have made contributions.  Guess not!

I appreciate being able to chat publicly with everyone
here about this subject today.  The subject is in the
open, and being addressed by the Foundation tomorrow,
so I will not post here concerning it from now on.

To let you know where I'm at personally, I'm
considering releasing my company's software for use
with Jabber.  If I can use the &quot;J&quot; word in my product
name, that would be great for me and great for the
Jabber Community.  If I can't use the &quot;J&quot; word, and
Judge Judy isn't selected for the trademark
infringement trial, I'll have to rename it =]  

I hope &quot;Jabber&quot; can be used by anyone with a great
product using Jabber technology.  Not just Jabber.com.

Flora
