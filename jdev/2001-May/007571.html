<PRE>You can now download and use the Jabber test suite without using CVS.
Simply download the tarball located at
<A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/jabbertest.">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/jabbertest.</A> 

Note that there is a script named run_test.sh that will run sar on the
Jabber server and run active_jab, the primary testing tool, locally. It
will then collect the remote sar stats. If you do not have sar download
sysstats for Linux or build your own scripts to use vmstat and so forth.
Also, the tool uses ssh, but you can easily replace with rsh if you are
insane enough to use it. 

You do NOT have to be able to use run_test.sh to use the package. You
can easily run active_jab alone if that is adequate for your task.
Finally, there is a limited README included that should give a overview
of how to use the package.

Regards, Dustin
