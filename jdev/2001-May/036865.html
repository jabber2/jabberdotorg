<PRE>In the last weeks I thought about a few interesting aspects of the 
future internet evolution. (This may sound strange but I have no other
words for this)

I'll just write down my ideas when I have time and send them to the
appropriate mailing lists.  Please think about them or discuss them.
I just want to know that other people get to them and that they are
not wasted. - If you have the time please send me a reply.  I'm not
subscribed to this mailing list. I don't have the time. Maybe I have
time in the next months to work on some of my ideas and I would like
to hear from anyone who thinks that they are worth working on them.

This first idea has to do with the human - network server interaction.

What I'm often not interested in is if my friends are on but if their
computers are. - Think of it in a P2P style. You have a CVS repository,
an ftp server, or something else important on another computer that's not
always online. - I would like to see the state of these systems in my 
Jabber to know if I can acces them (e.g. to check-in some files)

There are three other areas that need to be worked on in this environment:

1.) Servers have to be represented as another object. (They have to be
handled differently on the clients)

2.) It should be possible to establish a TCP session from one Jabber host
to the other to send data over in a non-DNS using fashion. (e.g. dynamic
IPs. - I know you can use dynamic-dns but jabber establishing a TCP
connection for CVS looks better to me.)

3.) It should be possible to be notified when a contact gets available.
(server/host or friend/human) - I don't want to have a sound whenever
someone logs in/out but what I really would like to see is a notification
when I first said &quot;tell me when &lt;blah&gt; is online&quot;.

I'll post my other ideas in a few days when I have time to write them
down.  I'd be really interested to hear from you if you have some
interesting thoughts or you want to work on this.

</PRE>
