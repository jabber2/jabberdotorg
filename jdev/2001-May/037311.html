<PRE>Correct, you can't subscribe to a specific resource.
 
May I offer a few words of sage advice in this area?  If personalbuddy
becomes very popular and you use the roster/subscription approach, you're
going to soon start hurting your server (and it darn well better not be MY
server!).  I know because I've done this myself with Jabberbot.  Jabberbot's
roster on Jabber.com is about 10 times the size of the next largest user's
roster.  Whenever Jabberbot tries to log in now, it causes all kinds of
server mayhem because every presence change causes the server to go read and
parse rosters of everyone in Jabberbot's roster.  This, and the subsequent
traffic backups, crash the server at Jabber.com (which is JCS, of course,
but I suspect the open source server would have the same problem).  That's
why I turned Jabberbot off about a month ago.
 
One better approach is to have Jabberbot (or personalbuddy) be a server-side
agent that has no roster controlled by the server.
 
 
Todd.

Good points, Jens.  I don't think you can subscribe just to a resource,
though.  A nice thing which shouldn't be too much of a change would be to
actually have to subscribe to &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">personalbuddy at jabber.com</A>&quot; rather than just
send messages to it.  That way you can just remove your subscription to the
presence and be done with it :)

Know any often updated projects on freshmeat so I can see this work?

If you send a message to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">personalbuddy at jabber.com</A> saying &quot;watch xxxxx&quot; where
xxxxx is the name of the package to watch it will send you notification of
updates. If you send &quot;ignore xxxxx&quot; it will stop sending them. 


I love the idea of presence/IM based services like this, but I'm worried
that we're going to get into a real mess where they're all driven by text
messages using various different syntaxes ... which is of course exactly
what happened in the e-mail world with list servers. (I just read a news
article yesterday about a new AIM based agent for Radiohead fans that sounds
like it's running some kind of Eliza-like &quot;natural language&quot; interface. Be
very afraid.) 


In the case of your personalbuddy, I can easily see people later deciding
they don't want the notifications anymore but not being able to remember the
magic &quot;ignore&quot; command. They'd then get mad at the agent for spamming them. 


Wouldn't it be cleaner to use the existing Jabber subscription model for
this rather than inventing your own? I.e. you subscribe to
&quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">xxxxx at alsutton.com</A>&quot;'s status and it will send you messages when xxxxx is
updated. To stop getting updates, unsubscribe. (The status message in the
presence could indicate the current version number.) 


Of course this requires that you run your own Jabber server at alsutton.com,
which you might not be willing or able to do. Is it possible in Jabber to
subscribe to a single resource? If so, then perhaps people could subscribe
to &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">personalbuddy at jabber.com</A>/xxxxx&quot; to get notifications for package xxxxx.
