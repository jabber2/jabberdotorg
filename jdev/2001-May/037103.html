<PRE>Possibly I am gonna get it, but here we go.

Am a relative newbie at Linux (having installed Redhat 7.1 and other earlier
versions before) and totally blank when it comes to Jabber.
Am heavily involved in designing, testing and implementing of free systems
for visually impaired people in the Netherlands. As Jabber would be THE
answer to all those who cannot use the numerous messaging clients around (as
they are NOT accesible using for instance a braille output or speech
synthesizers) I have taken it onto me to test and help the development team
to connect to our own server to test new clients.

My problem is the following. I have set up a jabber test server which was
not difficult at all.
But then, when wanting to add services to it, the whole thing starts to
backfire and starts to refuse to work in any way shape or form.

I find that the Howto's look good, but when a newbie like myself starts to
work through them, things go pearshaped. Do not get me wrong, I am not
knocking those who do wonderful things with developments, but please allow
those who are not in the know as much as yourself, to at least have a stab
at setting things up! Development (as I see it) needs proper documentation
and a debugging system, in order for others to immitate the trick one has
designed. Yet again, thanks for all your time and effort, i DO appreciate
it, but PLEASE help us to get things going.

So, what would I LOVE to see, if I may? Someone outthere who has a perfect
working Jabber.xml, who is willing to put a bit of work in it, to share
his/her success with those who are dying to start investigating and
developing with Jabber. Is there anybody out there who can help us? It would
save us a lot of time and effort. Is anyone willing to send us a fully
equipped jabber.xml file, for a server to run under RedHat 7.1, so that I
can avoid wasting time and fraying my nerves trying to get things right.

Thanks for your time.

Nic.
