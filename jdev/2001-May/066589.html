Just FYI to everyone, this is a feature, not a bug (the connect/disconnect
flip-flop problem is just an unfortunate side-effect).  With the internet as
flakey as it is due to many variables (not the least of which is the DDoS
attacks related by Jer) I think auto-reconnect is a must.

I DO like the idea that a client should only do this if it didn't get a
proper disconnect notice, but that's something that client developers should
handle :)  I think a more verbose stream:error would be great and using
codes (for non-english speakers AND so programmatic behavior can be set up)
is an excellent idea.

IMHO, if a client is disconnected by the server [receives an &lt;error&gt; and
&lt;/stream&gt;] it should not automatically attempt to reconnect. There is
probably some good reason it was disconnected, and this thread illustrates
one of the dangers of automatic reconnects. It'd be better to put up a
dialog box with &quot;Reconnect&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons and let the user decide.
(Having a meaningful error code and message to display in the dialog would
be even better, of course.) 


In the event of a network-level disconnect, where the stream isn't properly
closed, automatic reconnect might still be a good idea. It would help if the
client could use some kind of OS-specific functionality* to determine
whether the network is still up or not &#8212; if I unplug the Ethernet from my
laptop I don't want the client to start an infinite series of reconnect
attempts, nor do I want it to start dialing the phone to my ISP without my
intervention.

* In the case of Mac OS 9 there's an OTTCPWillDial function that's described
in some tech note, and in Mac OS X there's a System Configuration framework
which is not yet documented but whose [open] source can be found in Darwin.
