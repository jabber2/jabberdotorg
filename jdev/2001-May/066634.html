    Wrong analogy there, bud.  SMTP would be the use of the s2s components,
*NOT* to c2s.  This of c2s as POP or IMAP.  s2s is more like SMTP.  Now,
take one of those mailing lists, and send it to 250k inboxes by posting
directly to the IMAP boxes themselves.  (Ok, that ones bad, becouse IMAP
lets you share folders..  But just suspend reality for a minute)

&gt;&gt;<i> In the IM bot realm, the existence of ActiveBuddy &lt;www.activeBuddy.com&gt;

Perhaps
&gt;&gt;<i> they have some kind of special deal.)

&gt;<i> I agree with you that there are copious implementation reasons to

architectural reasons to (and reasons against it, as I listed earlier.)

    Theres a simple solution to this.  Remove all of the code that allows
you to be aware of whoe can see your presence.  And also, don't use rosters.
The jabber server will now function wonderfully.  Unfortionatly, users WANT
these features.  The company you mentioned above does NOT handle presence.
They simply respond to messages sent to them, and rely on the IM system in
front of it to handle it's presence.  Jabber decided it was a needed feature
to be able to know who can see you, and who you can see.  This feature
requires notifications, and these notifications and information parsing is
what kills the server.  c2s was written specifically with the idea that a
person was on one end, and designed as such.  This provides us with
numerouse features we DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO in other IM systems.

    And as a mental note, go ahead and start up any AIM or ICQ application,
and try to add 250k users to your roster.  Then come back, and tell me that
none of the other IM systems have this limitation.  Then go ahead and try to
load up your car with 20 tons of cargo, and drive somewhere.  Then you can
have this same conversation with the automakers about why passenger cars
can't do the same work as a Mack truck.
