<PRE>Bill,

I think you're missing the point.

A major reason why Jabber transports have trouble,
things aren't documented, and you're running into
other technical problems is because Jabber.com
prevents other corporations from using the Jabber
name.

If companies can't use the word &quot;Jabber&quot;, they have no
incentive to join the Jabber Community and offer
source code, documentation, enhancents back to the
community.

Lets let other corporations know that they're welcome
into the Jabber Community and have the same rights as
Jabber.Com to use the word &quot;Jabber&quot; in their product
names, URLs, company names, slogans, etc.  

By building the Jabber Community to include more
corporations, Jabber will become more stable, powerful
and ubiquitous.

Flora

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even more egregiously, there are no documents
</I>&gt;<i> telling anyone how to
</I>&gt;<i> interpret debug messages.  No offence, but &quot;Merlin
</I>&gt;<i> casts his spell&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> hardly useful as a diagnostic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or better yet, spend some time refining
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, rather than kvetching
</I>&gt;<i> about the name.  If you guys really want the project
</I>&gt;<i> to succeed (and I
</I>&gt;<i> FIRMLY believe that in time, it will), you might
</I>&gt;<i> want to get your priorities
</I>&gt;<i> in order.  Solve the problems with transports, fix
</I>&gt;<i> the docs, provide more
</I>&gt;<i> than very tiny, hastily-made, thumbnail HOWTO's;
</I>&gt;<i> then worry about a
</I>&gt;<i> cute-n-catchy name.  Believe me, most of us will
</I>&gt;<i> pick &quot;works&quot; over &quot;cute&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> any day.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As an ISP who really thinks that you have the start
</I>&gt;<i> of a FANTASTIC product,
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say there's a lot more to go in before the
</I>&gt;<i> name goes on.  PLEASE
</I>&gt;<i> don't fall into the M$ trap of coming up with a
</I>&gt;<i> grand name, then have no
</I>&gt;<i> real performance behind it.  What you have in-hand
</I>&gt;<i> thus far is MUCH too good
</I>&gt;<i> for that.  Respect the product, ensure that things
</I>&gt;<i> that are supposed to be
</I>&gt;<i> in it WORK (and work together), and somebody PLEASE
</I>&gt;<i> come up with some
</I>&gt;<i> documentation and support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure we're not the only ISP anxiously awaiting a
</I>&gt;<i> full-plate offering,
</I>&gt;<i> complete with easily-configurable transports.  Most
</I>&gt;<i> of us have a
</I>&gt;<i> passing-but-workable understanding of XML--that's
</I>&gt;<i> not the problem.  Even _I_
</I>&gt;<i> can inspect a document for well-formedness (honest,
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't sleep in XML
</I>&gt;<i> class! Well, not ALL the way through...).  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my defence, I've been configuring and compiling
</I>&gt;<i> things for *nix for over
</I>&gt;<i> 20 years.  If a reasonably-versed person like myself
</I>&gt;<i> is having a great deal
</I>&gt;<i> of trouble due to the paucity of &quot;What to do when it
</I>&gt;<i> blows up&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, think of the poor Linux newbie.  You
</I>&gt;<i> may as well throw
</I>&gt;<i> sendmail at 'em right out the box.  (Speaking of
</I>&gt;<i> things that sorely need
</I>&gt;<i> proper documentation!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is in when we attempt to configure
</I>&gt;<i> things that would add REAL
</I>&gt;<i> VALUE to the product.  Those external transports ARE
</I>&gt;<i> real value from a
</I>&gt;<i> small, independent ISP's viewpoint.  When the
</I>&gt;<i> configs parse correctly
</I>&gt;<i> (jabberd doesn't complain, that is) and are entered
</I>&gt;<i> exactly as the example
</I>&gt;<i> states (machine names excepted, of course) and the
</I>&gt;<i> transport still doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> work, there are NO diagnostics to tell us what we
</I>&gt;<i> did wrong.  &quot;Not
</I>&gt;<i> configured&quot; as an error message, when we can clearly
</I>&gt;<i> see configs in the
</I>&gt;<i> proper place (according to the slim HOWTO) and in
</I>&gt;<i> the documented format,
</I>&gt;<i> isn't a lot of help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Running the jabberd in debug mode doesn't really
</I>&gt;<i> help.  At no time did any
</I>&gt;<i> ONE process complain of ill configuration with a
</I>&gt;<i> message along the lines of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hey, Stupid, fix &lt;xxx/&gt; in the config and this
</I>&gt;<i> might work next time&quot;.  As
</I>&gt;<i> much diagnostic as we were able to glean was
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;returning unhandled&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What was returning from where and why fillintheblank
</I>&gt;<i> was unhandled, no clue
</I>&gt;<i> was given.  If you want Jabber to catch on and be
</I>&gt;<i> the thing to steamroll ICQ
</I>&gt;<i> and AIM for flexibility and utility (it could, it
</I>&gt;<i> could!), then there's a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of setup work left to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Folks, I'd really like to see the Jabber project
</I>&gt;<i> continue to evolve.  Rather
</I>&gt;<i> than waste bandwidth on picking names and logos, we
</I>&gt;<i> might want to focus on
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;what would make Jabber the next Ubiquitous Product
</I>&gt;<i> On Every Desktop&quot;.  Like
</I>&gt;<i> diagnostics and config help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What can we do to pitch in and help?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With deepest respect,
</I>&gt;<i> Bill
