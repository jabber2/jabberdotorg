Yep, totally agree that that would be the best place to carry on this 
discussion. I won't be able to make the meeting myself though, so I'll leave 
you with a couple of snippets from the Jabber.com site
( <A HREF="http://www.jabber.com/open_source/enterprise.shtml">http://www.jabber.com/open_source/enterprise.shtml</A> )

&lt;snippet&gt;
The onus is on the Open Source Company to ensure that theOpen Source 
Enterprise works. The reason is clear: the Community can exist without the 
Company, but the Company can't exist without the Community. So for the 
Enterprise to work, the Company has to be Community-centric. Everything the 
Company does, from development, to licensing, to marketing has to put the 
Community first. In this way, the Open Source Community grows, the market for 
the Open Source Software grows, and not coincidentally the Open Source 
Company grows.
&lt;/snippet&gt;

&lt;snippet&gt;
All of this might is a bit utopian, so perhaps a dose of realism is in order. 
For one thing, more than likely there won't be just one Company associated 
with an Open Source Community. Different companies will vie for the attention 
of different factions within the Community. Such conflicts can easily lead to 
schisms within the Community that will fracture its overall efforts to 
advance the software. 
&lt;/snippet&gt;

Perhaps anyone who will be able to attend the meeting and who has an interest 
in this particular point of discussion might also care to read the rest of 
the Jabber.com Open Source papers so as not to take those two snippets above 
out of context.
There again, perhaps these papers are out of date anyways. One other quote 
from them (which follows directly on from snippet 1 above) :-

&lt;snippet&gt;
By accepting this reality, the Company has a very clear appreciation of where 
its commercial opportunities lie. The Company doesn't even consider selling 
the core software. Instead, the Company concentrates on developing add-on 
modules that businesses might find useful to install and monitor the core 
software.
&lt;/snippet&gt;

&quot;Doesn't even consider selling the core software&quot; ehh? Maybe I'm reading it 
wrong ;-)

Cheers,
Sean
