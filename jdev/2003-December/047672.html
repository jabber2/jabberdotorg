<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Unless you use client side echo removal (which ofcourse will put some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extra burden on the client, what I'm indeed trying to avoid all along, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's still a compromise). But agreed, this is one of the main advantages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of using a direct link based conference. Again, you'll benifit the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and the disadvantages will be the least obvious) if all clients have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; somewhat equal specs, while in most cases I doubt this is true for Joe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Consumer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course not all machines will have equal specs, but if they were bought
</I>&gt;<i> within the last 3-5 years they will likely be plenty powerful enough for our
</I>&gt;<i> requirements as far as CPU power goes.
</I>
lol, sorry, richard, you have no experience what is needed to actually
encode and decode data, i think ... ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Ofcourse you still have to mix when you use DirectX ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Playing two (or more) streams simultaneously is not mixing as far as I
</I>&gt;<i> am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; concerned, so no you dont necessarly have to even mix.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ofcourse the streams are mixed, just by DirectX/ALSA/whatever instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you. If your soundcard has some Direct X compatible hardware for this the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soundcard can do the mixing. (Which is still true in many cases if you use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a server that uses DirectX for mixing too)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the point is that you do not have to manually code it and in so doing do
</I>&gt;<i> it in the processor, using such things as directx means it is far more
</I>&gt;<i> optimised and will take advantage of any sound hardware (or processor
</I>&gt;<i> extensions such as SSE) you have to accellerate this. This is in contrast to
</I>&gt;<i> server mixing that will have to be manually done in the processor as it
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be re-encoded and retransmitted.
</I>
in fact server encoding can use direct x hardware, too. why shouldn't
it? 

&gt;<i> &gt; Then we both don't know ;) But most implementations probably won't be so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advanced, if this is even possible (and you made a good point about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; re-encoding, which I more seriously doubt you can optimize much)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes the real problem is the re-encoding, not the mixing.
</I>
not necessarily a problem. it can be optimized in many ways ... 


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Because you will hear yourself echo from the other end, that is I
</I>&gt;<i> thought
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what you meant, but overall I doubt syncing is something we really need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; concentrate on or worry about too much.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Out of sync mixing is *the* biggest annoyance about direct-link based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conferencing if you ask me. Escp. when participants have severly different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connections. I find this unbareable to work with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fine but not all people find it as much of a problem as you do.
</I>
and not all people agree with this statement. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; its a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; modified version of your model where instead of having a single server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; could have as many as possible which communicate with each other via
</I>&gt;<i> p2p,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; but anyone who is incapable due to platform issues, bandwidth, CPU,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; firewall
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; etc to act as a server itself connects to one of these servers, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; provides the benefit of more evenly load balancing the CPU/bandwidth use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the chat over several nodes rather than concentrating on one, provides
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; instant fall back to another server if one has problems or leaves, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; provides your primary benefit of being able to support dialup users or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; simple clients like pocket pc's or people who cant go p2p because of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; firewalls.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think my idea as decribed more at the beginning of this email and here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are pretty much alike. Are you suggesting a persistant network or these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; servers (which is p2p I suppose) or a per-conference network? (which I'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather just call clustering of the servers)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would just be a per chat network automatically setup from the chat
</I>&gt;<i> participants.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you feel such a system should be part of the &quot;base&quot; spec for (audio)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conferncing or an extention? And what do you feel should be done for NAT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; traversel in person to person? In case you suggest a peristant network of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these nodes is that what should be used for that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I feel this must be part of the base spec, and I dont feel a persistent
</I>&gt;<i> network is needed, as far as NAT traversal goes the servers will need to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to full traverse the NAT or firewall they have, which can be done with
</I>&gt;<i> UPnP (Zeroconf ?), or manual setup by a knowledgable person, but we must try
</I>&gt;<i> to minimize that requirement.
</I>
of course it is needed to have a persistant network. and to remind
again: it's needed to have video conferencing, too.
