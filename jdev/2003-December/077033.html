<PRE>You might be better off just writing your own lib for that. Not only 
would it have a smaller footprint (because you only want to implement a 
limited subset), but you would be familiar with the interface, fit 
better in your win32 environment, etc etc. I know you are looking for a 
quick fix, but it probably would be better in the long run to develop 
something in house (would take a day at the most for a couple of guys). 
And the bonus is you don't have to deal with open source licenses.
