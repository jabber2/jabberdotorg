  Well, if it does not have to be jabberoo. I have some win32 dll's and
  the deps laying around. The source code even has a vc.net 2003 project
  file thats fairly up to date.

  Its 17MB in size but that is both debug and release builds with all
  deps.

  Let me know when/if you get it so I can take the zip offline.

  &gt; they are?
  &gt; Do you know of any win32 ones, i found a WinCE one but it was missing
  &gt; some header files. It always seem to be the case that nothing is
  &gt; complete.

  &gt;         
  &gt;         Do you have to use jabberoo specifically?  There are many
  &gt;         libraries available, 
  &gt;         some probably more win32 friendly than others.
  &gt;         
  &gt;         By the way, CVS stands for Concurrent Versions System, which
  &gt;         is useful keeping 
  &gt;         track of all file changes throughout an entire project.  Maybe
  &gt;         you've seen MS 
  &gt;         SourceSafe, which is similar to this.  You might consider CVS
  &gt;         for your future 
  &gt;         game projects. ;-)

  &gt;         &gt; Hi,
  &gt;         &gt;
  &gt;         &gt; I have been asked to add jabberoo protocol comms to a gaming
  &gt;         project I am
  &gt;         &gt; writing in MSDev VC++ V6 for Win32 (not MFC) I come from the
  &gt;         gaming world
  &gt;         &gt; not the opensource or CVS world (i dont even know what CVS
  &gt;         stands for or
  &gt;         &gt; does) and am having some difficulty finding a solution that
  &gt;         just runs
  &gt;         &gt; &quot;straight out of the box&quot;
  &gt;         &gt;
  &gt;         &gt; I have downloaded various jabber libs, judo libs, sigc++
  &gt;         libs and cannot
  &gt;         &gt; get any complete set to match together and link. Nothing
  &gt;         seems to quite
  &gt;         &gt; work with anything else and everything seems to have to come
  &gt;         from a
  &gt;         &gt; different place.
  &gt;         &gt;
  &gt;         &gt; I dont actually need a chat system, I only need to log on,
  &gt;         show presence,
  &gt;         &gt; send computer generated messages, receive other computer
  &gt;         generated mesages
  &gt;         &gt; and log off.
  &gt;         &gt;
  &gt;         &gt; Does anybody out there have a complete jaberoo source and
  &gt;         lib or set of
  &gt;         &gt; libs that i can link into an unrelated project for Win32 on
  &gt;         Devstudio and
  &gt;         &gt; contains eveything it needs so all I have to do is start
  &gt;         calling functions.
  &gt;         &gt;
  &gt;         &gt; If you happen to have it as a simple example project so I
  &gt;         can actually see
  &gt;         &gt; how to use it from the start that would be even better.
  &gt;         &gt;
  &gt;         &gt;
  &gt;         &gt; Thanks in advance,
  &gt;         &gt;
