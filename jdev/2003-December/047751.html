<PRE>I dont know if it has to be specifically jabberoo, but thats what they are using on the linux server side i am told. Will any jabber lib talk to any other so I can use anything or do I have to use jabberoo as they are?
Do you know of any win32 ones, i found a WinCE one but it was missing some header files. It always seem to be the case that nothing is complete.

  Do you have to use jabberoo specifically?  There are many libraries available, 
  some probably more win32 friendly than others.

  By the way, CVS stands for Concurrent Versions System, which is useful keeping 
  track of all file changes throughout an entire project.  Maybe you've seen MS 
  SourceSafe, which is similar to this.  You might consider CVS for your future 
  game projects. ;-)

  &gt; Hi,
  &gt;
  &gt; I have been asked to add jabberoo protocol comms to a gaming project I am
  &gt; writing in MSDev VC++ V6 for Win32 (not MFC) I come from the gaming world
  &gt; not the opensource or CVS world (i dont even know what CVS stands for or
  &gt; does) and am having some difficulty finding a solution that just runs
  &gt; &quot;straight out of the box&quot;
  &gt;
  &gt; I have downloaded various jabber libs, judo libs, sigc++ libs and cannot
  &gt; get any complete set to match together and link. Nothing seems to quite
  &gt; work with anything else and everything seems to have to come from a
  &gt; different place.
  &gt;
  &gt; I dont actually need a chat system, I only need to log on, show presence,
  &gt; send computer generated messages, receive other computer generated mesages
  &gt; and log off.
  &gt;
  &gt; Does anybody out there have a complete jaberoo source and lib or set of
  &gt; libs that i can link into an unrelated project for Win32 on Devstudio and
  &gt; contains eveything it needs so all I have to do is start calling functions.
  &gt;
  &gt; If you happen to have it as a simple example project so I can actually see
  &gt; how to use it from the start that would be even better.
  &gt;
  &gt;
  &gt; Thanks in advance,
  &gt;
  &gt;
