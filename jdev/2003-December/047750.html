<PRE>Footprint isnt an issue as there will be about 10Meg of graphics to go with it. time is my factor, i dont have much nor a couple of guys. Or any experience of writing this kind of stuff. I have too much to do elsewhere on the project, unless you know someone who wants to give it a go?

  You might be better off just writing your own lib for that. Not only 
  would it have a smaller footprint (because you only want to implement a 
  limited subset), but you would be familiar with the interface, fit 
  better in your win32 environment, etc etc. I know you are looking for a 
  quick fix, but it probably would be better in the long run to develop 
  something in house (would take a day at the most for a couple of guys). 
  And the bonus is you don't have to deal with open source licenses.

  &gt; Hi,
  &gt;  
  &gt; I have been asked to add jabberoo protocol comms to a gaming project I 
  &gt; am writing in MSDev VC++ V6 for Win32 (not MFC) I come from the gaming 
  &gt; world not the opensource or CVS world (i dont even know what CVS 
  &gt; stands for or does) and am having some difficulty finding a solution 
  &gt; that just runs &quot;straight out of the box&quot;
  &gt;  
  &gt; I have downloaded various jabber libs, judo libs, sigc++ libs and 
  &gt; cannot get any complete set to match together and link. Nothing seems 
  &gt; to quite work with anything else and everything seems to have to come 
  &gt; from a different place.
  &gt;  
  &gt; I dont actually need a chat system, I only need to log on, show 
  &gt; presence, send computer generated messages, receive other computer 
  &gt; generated mesages and log off.
  &gt;  
  &gt; Does anybody out there have a complete jaberoo source and lib or set 
  &gt; of libs that i can link into an unrelated project for Win32 on 
  &gt; Devstudio and contains eveything it needs so all I have to do is start 
  &gt; calling functions.
  &gt;  
  &gt; If you happen to have it as a simple example project so I can actually 
  &gt; see how to use it from the start that would be even better.
  &gt;  
  &gt;  
  &gt; Thanks in advance,
  &gt;  
  &gt;  
  &gt; Mike Fox
