<PRE>Hi,

I have been asked to add jabberoo protocol comms to a gaming project I am writing in MSDev VC++ V6 for Win32 (not MFC) I come from the gaming world not the opensource or CVS world (i dont even know what CVS stands for or does) and am having some difficulty finding a solution that just runs &quot;straight out of the box&quot;

I have downloaded various jabber libs, judo libs, sigc++ libs and cannot get any complete set to match together and link. Nothing seems to quite work with anything else and everything seems to have to come from a different place.

I dont actually need a chat system, I only need to log on, show presence, send computer generated messages, receive other computer generated mesages and log off.

Does anybody out there have a complete jaberoo source and lib or set of libs that i can link into an unrelated project for Win32 on Devstudio and contains eveything it needs so all I have to do is start calling functions.

If you happen to have it as a simple example project so I can actually see how to use it from the start that would be even better.


Thanks in advance,


Mike Fox
