<PRE>&gt;<i> we have two problems to deal with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) network architecture
</I>&gt;<i> 2) encoding/decoding
</I>&gt;<i>    2a) audio en/decoding
</I>&gt;<i>    2b) video en/decoding
</I>
No the two problems we have are appropriately optimising audio/video vs
plain audio (have have only really been discussing plain audio so far), IMO
it would be a bad idea to try and create video optimisations and apply them
to plain audio as it has been shown that plain audio can be best optimised
another way.

&gt;<i> where do you want to start?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> do you want to assume video is the same as audio? propably not, video
</I>&gt;<i> has much higher requirements than audio, don't forget to add this to the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, [and so on, and so on].
</I>
Yes I know video has much higher requirements than plain audio, which is why
I think we should solve one thing at a time, audio conferencing can be best
optimised in particular ways that have already been discussed, whereas video
is a whole different ball game for which a lot of the aformentioned
optimisations will not be entirely appropriate.

&gt;<i> can we agree on the fact that we need video and audio in conferencing?
</I>&gt;<i> (we then can finally start to think more detailed about protocol specs).
</I>
I dont think we really can, the way people use audio and video in such
clients tends to be completely different, people will mostly use video in a
one2one fashion (normal home users i am talking about, not businesses).
There is no need to fully combine these into a single spec, it is far better
to do plain audio and audio/video separately although there is no reason
they cant overlap at appropriate points.
