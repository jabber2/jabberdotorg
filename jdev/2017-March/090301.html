</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi folks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As many of you will have noticed, we had a &#8216;minor issue&#8217; with the server at the weekend. To cut a moderately long story short, there was a failure at the hosting provider, destroying the server that hosts the xmpp.org XMPP service, website, wiki, xmpp.net service, etc. etc. Because these things always work better together, we then discovered that that machine wasn&#8217;t being backed up. The upshot of this is that we&#8217;ve potentially permanently lost most of the data on the server. We&#8217;re working to bring services back online as well as we can and recover what data we can, but there will be data loss even in the best possible case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s been helping recover from this, but especially Edwin who&#8217;s put in obscene amounts of time and is continuing to do so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it happens that you have any of the wiki data locally for some reason (e.g. browser tabs still open), please recover it and send it our way.

Thanks Daniel,
People are suggesting that on other lists too, so I&#8217;ll post the same reply across all of them:

Thanks Martin. I should probably have clarified that we know about archive.org, sadly it&#8217;s a little incomplete - but yes, this is our fallback (we&#8217;re also trying google cache scraping) :)
