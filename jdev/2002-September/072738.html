the proxy is a must in many ways, as PHP has no way of sharing the
connection between 2 runs, i remember someone saying that they were
planning on doing something like this.

(my memory is good but i always forget names =)

</I>
I must admit, this was the first thing that came into my mind, but i
came to think about the same problem. There isn't too many ways to pass
on the password to the applet without giving it out in plaintext (or
some weak encoding)

ofcourse, yet another method comes into my mind.. you could write an
authentication mod that uses one time passwords or other tokens to
authenticate the user. This is a lot of work though.

&gt;<i> &gt;ofcourse, you can always attempt to add support for additional protocols
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(like the ICMP ping) which do not have the same limitations as TCP =)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be much to adventurous for me :)
</I>
heh.. you could say that.. although it's not that funny anymore when you
remember that apache2 has a ICMP connection method as an example module
;)
