Hi Chris,
See the answer of Colin Holywell&quot; , author of ColinJabber client to me.
&quot;BusinessChat is violating the GNU General Public Licescene.  I am in Canada here and for some reason I can not reach that website?  What they are doing is illegal.  I have been getting lots of email about it but I have never seen the website or the messenger.&quot;
So ur view of &quot;There's really only so many ways to make a client
look (WinJab looks like Exodus looks like Yahoo IM, etc). So with
bchat's &quot;Business Chat&quot; IM looking like ColinJab that doesn't
automatically mean that they copied it. Maybe they copied the look of
it, who knows. &quot; is not correct.
Bye

I believe that anyone can take the GPLed code, add their mods, and then
resell it *provided that they provide the source code to it*. Kinda like
RedHat does with its linux distro.

Not that you insinuated that this is the case, but it should be pointed
out that the FAQ point for Jabber licensing:
<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/faq.html#AEN59">http://www.jabber.org/faq.html#AEN59</A>
makes it clear that 'jabber' is a protocol standard, like http, and you
can make a proprietary client all you want, like the IE browser.

There's another question in Saradhi's post and that is &quot;GPLing&quot; the look
and feel of a client. There's really only so many ways to make a client
look (WinJab looks like Exodus looks like Yahoo IM, etc). So with
bchat's &quot;Business Chat&quot; IM looking like ColinJab that doesn't
automatically mean that they copied it. Maybe they copied the look of
it, who knows. It would be interesting to see if an author of a GPLed
work can force someone to reveal their source code (didn't this happen
with a DVD player recently?)
