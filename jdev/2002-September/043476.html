I'm tempted to say &quot;yes&quot;, however the actual problem has only been 
observed by a few people, so I guess it might be a bit too paranoid. 
The symptoms are pretty easy to spot: jabberd stops responding, consumes 
all the CPU, and there is a binary in the logfile where there should be 
plain text.  If someone sees these symptoms then remove the JUD.

&gt;&gt;<i>The other observation about this problem is that shortly before the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>server spirals into its endless loop, the log file shows that it tried
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to access the global.xdb file (where JUD entries get stored); however

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... with a pointer (you said that on 09/09)
</I>
Hmm, right, i did say that.  But pointers on intel are 4 bytes (I deal 
with too many machine types...).  There are clearly 8 bytes being 
overwritten in the filename... I won't make any claim as to what those 
bytes are, except to say they are _not_ the filename.

Eg. It should read &quot;/var/spool/jaber/jud/global.xdb&quot; however instead I 
see in my log file: &quot;decaching 0.$...*.ol/jabber/jud/global.xdb&quot; where 
&quot;.&quot; represents nonprinting characters.  Those 8 bytes in hex have the 
values: 30 1C 24 09 98 B6 2A 08.

If they were pointers that would be 0x09241c30 and 0x082ab698 
repectively.  Neither of those are valid addresses in any of my jabberd 
processes, so I suspect they are not pointers... sorry for the earlier 
claim as being such.
&gt;<i> We made another observation: After jabberd and jud crashed global.xdb
</I>&gt;<i> was rewritten totally: All entries except the one of the user who
</I>&gt;<i> crashed it did not exist any longer :-(
</I>
Wow, that is a departure from mine... our xdb file remained intact, at 
least, I didn't _notice_ that anything was lost from it.  This would 
imply to me that there might be race condition between multiple threads 
trying to write to the data file.  Something I hadn't really considered 
until now.

&gt;<i> Until now I only can say that the main trigger for this was a
</I>&gt;<i> misconfigured client which had no appropriate locales so it sent
</I>&gt;<i> xml-garbage.
</I>
Hmm, then we should be able to spot the garbled XML being transmitted 
with a packet sniffer.  I regularly run tcpdump and log _everything_, 
and I don't remember seeing anything that I'd consider invalid in the 
packets leading up to the crash.  Would like to be proven wrong though.

&gt;<i> The question also is whether it is not a waste of time to locate the
</I>&gt;<i> problems or if it would be better to write a new (perhaps SQL-based)
</I>&gt;<i> JUD as temas suggested?
</I>
Yep, maybe.  Not sure I'd go the SQL route, unless dealing with a really 
large (distributed) jabber server farm.  For single host systems, I 
think it would be easier to just keep everything in RAM, writing to disk 
only when there are changes made.  It would only take a few megabytes to 
  hold even a moderately sized user directory.  That should be pretty 
easy to implement as well.
