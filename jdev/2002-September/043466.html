Since I didn't see any reply on the list, I'm going to send my 2 cents.

There are 2 java servers I know of:
- a non-free but open-source: 
<A HREF="http://www.alsutton.com/software/jabserv/index.html.">http://www.alsutton.com/software/jabserv/index.html.</A> Quite basic, not 
really finished. The author provides also some jabber related libraries
- on open-source: <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jabaserver/.">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jabaserver/.</A> Not 
finished but more robust, based on the avalon/phoenix framework.

There's also the jabberbeans project 
(<A HREF="http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/jabberbeans">http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/jabberbeans</A>) that provides some 
basic server side code.

I also have just discovered today that marbles (&quot;Java Library that 
provides both primitives and framework for development of Jabber 
services&quot;) has reached 1.0 and can be found on <A HREF="http://www.jabber.com/">http://www.jabber.com/</A> in 
the developers area. It can be used to write server side components. 
BTW, one can also find there jabber documentation.

For the rest, I remember &quot;of an open-source server-to-server component. 
This &quot;Server Connection Manager&quot; (or SCM) will help build out the Jabber 
network by making it easier for Jabber servers to reliably connect to 
each other&quot; (see <A HREF="http://oid.jabber.org/?oid=2351">http://oid.jabber.org/?oid=2351</A>) but can't find more 
anymore about it.

You can find here an introduction on jabber components: 
<A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/general/html/component-intro.html">http://docs.jabber.org/general/html/component-intro.html</A>

Here more about s2s dialback: 
<A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/draft-proto/html/dialback.html">http://docs.jabber.org/draft-proto/html/dialback.html</A>

Finally, here's the jep on transporting xml-rpc over jabber (delivery of 
commands): <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0009.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0009.html</A>

FYI, client information are normally managed by the server they belong 
to. These information can be stored in files, database (mysql, odbc, 
...), ldap. Routing of messages between server is simple, as soon as the 
server has a FQDN. If a client is offline, messages are stored on its 
server.

</I>&gt;<i> 1 Central server
</I>&gt;<i> 10 2nd tier servers that are located at network access points.  All 
</I>&gt;<i> are hidden behind a single DNS Round Robin.
</I>&gt;<i> 400+ 3rd tier servers that are located at client locations.  User to

</I>&gt;<i> and servers are wintel, and run JRE 1.3.1.   Servers are a minimum of 
</I>&gt;<i> Dual PIII 500 with 512MB Ram.  In the future clients and servers will 
</I>&gt;<i> also be run on an assortment of unix flavors so Java is an absolute must.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For software distribution, clients contact the 2nd Tier, and are 
</I>&gt;<i> redirected to the best available 3rd tier servers automatically based 
</I>&gt;<i> on network subnet.  This assignment information is stored on the 
</I>&gt;<i> client machine and would be available for my Jabber client.  This 
</I>&gt;<i> being the case, there would be no problem handling the redirection, 
</I>&gt;<i> load balancing, or fail over from the client perspective.  This 
</I>&gt;<i> approach is old hat for us and has proven to be a very reliable 
</I>&gt;<i> approach for gathering data and sending it upstream, or downloading 
</I>&gt;<i> and installing code updates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am contemplating is using Jabber to provide real time presence 
</I>&gt;<i> data, as well as a method for delivery of commands to the remote 
</I>&gt;<i> clients from a central location.  The client portion of this looks 
</I>&gt;<i> very straightforward and I see little problem with coding a client in 
</I>&gt;<i> java to facilitate this portion of the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The server portion however does not look so straight forward.  There 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be no Java based server components other than for web 
</I>&gt;<i> servers. Also there seems to be little information about use of Jabber 
</I>&gt;<i> in a distributed environment such as this.  Thus far I have found 
</I>&gt;<i> little detailed information on server 2 server communications, or how 
</I>&gt;<i> client information is stored, or how the one would go about locating 
</I>&gt;<i> clients that are nested several servers deep.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts or feedback on this project would be greatly appreciated.
