I believe that anyone can take the GPLed code, add their mods, and then
resell it *provided that they provide the source code to it*.  Kinda like
RedHat does with its linux distro.

Not that you insinuated that this is the case, but it should be pointed
out that the FAQ point for Jabber licensing:
	<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/faq.html#AEN59">http://www.jabber.org/faq.html#AEN59</A>
makes it clear that 'jabber' is a protocol standard, like http, and you
can make a proprietary client all you want, like the IE browser.

There's another question in Saradhi's post and that is &quot;GPLing&quot; the look
and feel of a client.  There's really only so many ways to make a client
look (WinJab looks like Exodus looks like Yahoo IM, etc).  So with
bchat's &quot;Business Chat&quot; IM looking like ColinJab that doesn't
automatically mean that they copied it.  Maybe they copied the look of
it, who knows.  It would be interesting to see if an author of a GPLed
work can force someone to reveal their source code (didn't this happen
with a DVD player recently?)
