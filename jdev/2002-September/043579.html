Hi,

Invisibility support is available in the latest server.
 
There are two ways to use Jabber invisibility: 
on a per-buddy and on a per-server basis. 
 To use per-buddy invisibility: 
One can be visible to all others buddies and can set his invisibility 
Only to a particular user if he wants. This can be done be done by choosing the buddy name to whom the user wants invisible and send a invisible message and the user wont be visible to that particular buddy, and he is online to all other users. This is done by sending &quot;Do not Distrub&quot; Tag to the corresponding user.The &quot;Temporarily&quot; part is a dead give-away. Your invisibility to that buddy will last only until the next time you log on or until you set server invisibility (discussed next) on and off.  Server-Invisibility:
This is similar to Invisible mode, that will be followed in most of the messengers especially . The user is invisible to all the users.One can set yourself invisible per-server and subsequently make yourself visible to selected buddies only. This is also can be done by sending the &quot;do not distrub&quot; presence message to the server immediately after the user authentic is over. Hope this solved ur doubts.
