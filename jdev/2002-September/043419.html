<PRE>hi,

&gt;<i> 1.) While replying to a jabber.iq:roster, if the jid is part of a group
</I>&gt;<i> (passed to it by the client), the group name is sent back to it in the &lt;/grp&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> tag &amp; not in the well known &lt;/group&gt; tag.
</I>sorry, this was already fixed in the CVS ... but i did not make any new xdb_sql
release since then :( ...


&gt;<i> 2.) If the client wants to add a buddy in a different group, it is taken
</I>&gt;<i> care of by rostergroups table, but the client cannot add more than 1 entry
</I>&gt;<i> (meaning one user can store only one jid corresponding to one group). This is 
</I>&gt;<i> because in xdbsql_roster_set, a call is made to roster_purge function.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead can't we remove roster_purge call in xdbsql_roster_set fn. &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> change the &quot;insert&quot; command (in mysql) into &quot;replace delayed&quot; (in 
</I>&gt;<i> xdb_sql.xml)??
</I>I'm not sure to understand the change you're talking about ...
Anyway, there is a call to roster_purge because jabber resends the whole roster
each time it is modified. The principle is that xdb_sql just stores what jabber
send to it, no more ...


&gt;<i> 3.) If I were to add a buddy with the buddy not online, but offline, the
</I>&gt;<i> request is saved in mysql with subscription=none. Now when the buddy logs in,
</I>&gt;<i> the result of jabber:iq:roster should contain a &lt;/presence&gt; tag with a
</I>&gt;<i> type='subscribe' attribute' for the client to know its a subscription request, 
</I>&gt;<i> after the normal &lt;/iq&gt; response , but it does not happen this way.  As 
</I>&gt;<i> mod_roster_out_iq fn. in mod_roster.c sends out the additional &lt;/presence&gt; tag 
</I>&gt;<i> only if subscription attribute is not null, this condition is not matched &amp; the
</I>&gt;<i> presence tag is not sent to the client.
</I>comparison is not made on 'subscription' attribute but on 'subscribe' attribute,
that's a lot different :)
to my knowledge, this has always worked ... what is stored onto this 'subscribe'
attribute in the DB ?
 

regards,

Benoit.
