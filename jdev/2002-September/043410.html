<PRE>Hi,
I have been away from jabber for too long and guess it's about time that i 
contributed something to the community. Peter can you asign me some coding? 

I couldn't contribute to the newsgroups or to any coding stuff since april 
as i was involved in creating an embedded jabber client in ansi c (25mhz ARM 
7 with 4mb ram) . Then it was followed up with integrating jabber with a 
closed source windows app, some fixes to xdb_sql and xdb_java then to top it 
off i had to write a jabber applet in swing. Naturally all this made me 
quite sick of jabber for a while :-( 

Last week however i got a couple of personal mails from guys who had a read 
a few of my old postings and realised it's time for a come back. Though most 
of the stuff i mention above is proprietory there is still quite a bit of 
work that i can contribute and hope to keep the committers busy the next few 
weeks :-))
