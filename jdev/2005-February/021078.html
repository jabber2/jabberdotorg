<PRE>&gt;<i> Sorry, but I dont think that is a good idea from the political point
</I>&gt;<i> of view. Jabber was created due to the problems and incapabilities of
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary messenger protocols. It would be kind of stupid to
</I>&gt;<i> support/use now other protocols which are proprietary and the same
</I>&gt;<i> piece of crap for VoIP as ICQ/MSN/Yahoo is for Instant Messaging.
</I>&gt;<i> Especially due to the fact that there are a lot of free VoIP
</I>&gt;<i> Applications out there, and there is (iirc) already a standard for
</I>&gt;<i> VoIP-Signalling over jabber.
</I>
There are some solutions for this already; people using callto URLs in 
iq:oob messages, and launching external programs, and things like that. 
  There's also Apple's audio/video chat implementation under iChat AV, 
which actually seems to work quite well (albeit entirely bypassing 
bytestreams).

Why not pressure Apple to JEP up their AV, and thus have it 
interoperable with other Jabber clients?  It's actually not that 
complex a protocol, and seems pretty decent in many ways, even if it 
wasn't done through the community process.

(Of course, considering how long it took us to finalize XHTML-IM, which 
is a great deal less complicated than realtime AV chat, I can kind of 
see why Apple -- who have release deadlines to meet -- wandered off to 
implement a bunch of things on their own, instead of writing up JEP 
drafts and waiting for things to wind their way through the approval 
process.)
