<PRE>Hello,

I like to announce 0.1 release of PONCHO ( <A HREF="http://poncho.sf.net/">http://poncho.sf.net/</A> ). It's 
a framework for automation and surveillence applications. It connects 
all kind of devices over Jabber into a Peer-to-Peer network of devices 
that notify each other about occuring events.

The object-model makes it very easy to integrate new devices without 
knowning anything about Jabber or networking at all.

It is released under the LGPL license.

It is implemented in Java AND C++. The Java version is based on SMACK 
and the C++ version is based on iksemel and entirely free of other 
dependencies which makes cross-compiling easy. We run it on a 
ARM-Platfrom based on uClibc.

It features a high-level C++ wrapper around libiksemel that heaviliy 
uses the Observer-Pattern which makes it easy to use it. We support 
Presence-, Subscription-, Message- and Iq-Handlers with support for 
namespaces. So far, we implemented, apart from the PONCHO-specific 
stuff, the Roster handling. The JabberClient class is really 
light-weight makeing it perfect for embedded-linux solutions. It should 
also be very easy to port it to any other OS that iksemel can be ported to.

Check it out! And let me know what you think about. This is my first 
open-source-project and I would be happy about any comment.

regards
erich buri
