Jabber is instant, near real time. So this means you're get a near real  
time &quot;instant failure&quot;, if your message can not be delivered. This opposed  
to email where failure isn't &quot;instant&quot; at all, if you send a message it  
can stay in the queue for up to 2 weeks and there is nothing you can do  
about it. This is why SMTP uses a store-and-forward architecture.

It's possible to use XMPP in a store and forward fashion, you wouldn't  
need to modify the protocol for it. It's still an &quot;edge&quot; case though. A  
good reason for XMPP to replace email in my opinion is this concept of  
&quot;instant&quot; error reporting.

However, lack of standardized message tracking and reporting (knowing what  
stanzas are received and processed) makes that rather hard as well.
