<PRE>Hi,

This would be a feature of your Jabber server software.  You might contact the 
maker of the software, as they may be able to help you best.

The 'jdev' mailing list is mainly for general development discussion, and not 
about any certain software in particular.  It might be possible that people 
can help here, but you may want to tell us what server software you're using 
in that case. :)  (since you mention .c files, I'm going to guess it's 
jabberd, but you really should specify).
