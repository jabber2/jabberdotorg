Maybe it's not fully clear (and I'm simply reading from the quoted text you 
provided), but what [3] is intended to mean is that you would perform the 
SOCKS5 protocol over the established TCP connection from [1].  There are not 
two connections.  I suppose it is spelled out in steps like this in case 
you're writing your own SOCKS protocol code.  If you're using a SOCKS library 
to perform the connection, which will both create the TCP connection as well 
as negotiate the SOCKS5 protocol over it, then that's all you need to use.

&gt;<i> Proxy.setDefaultProxy(host, port); // sets SOCKS5 proxy to be

&gt;<i> So this tells me that the actual SOCKS5 host to connect to is the SHA1

Well, just to ensure our terminology is clear, the SOCKS5 host (or proxy, or 
server, or whatever) is 192.168.1.100.  The destination (or DST) host, ie the 
one that you'll ask the SOCKS5 host to bridge you to, is the hash.

Of course, you're aware that the hash is not a real host, and that the SOCKS5 
host (in this example, Psi) is not actually going to perform an outbound 
connection to the DST as a result.  It is simply used as a handshake.

&gt;<i> Socket ss = new SocksSocket(SocksHost, 0);
</I>
My confusion with this line of code is that I don't see how it relates to the 
Proxy object.  In other words, how does the SocksSocket know what SOCKS5 host 
to connect to?  I know nothing about the library you're using though, so 
maybe the Proxy object interfaces with some global settings in the 
background, and SocksSocket draws from that.

It could be that you understand the protocol, and are coding with the right 
intent, but simply coding it wrong. ;-)

&gt;<i> p.s. btw Justin... great work on the PSI client!

Glad you like it. :)

Have fun,
-Justin
