<PRE>Hmmm... okay, so I took your suggestion regarding the handshake. I
change my code to do the following now  :

[pseudo code]
Set Socks5Proxy to 192.168.1.100:8010
Set Socks5Proxy to direct connect to 192.168.1.100 and no-authentication
Open a Socks5Connection to 192.168.1.100:8010

So far so good, everything works well up to this point. I then send a
SOCKS request as described in the protocol and send it
[<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1928.html].">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1928.html].</A> It sends just fine but then I
get a weird response back from the initiator. Instead of getting a
response packet I get the following :

000000000

*sigh*... 9 zeros... nothing at all like the request packet that i was
expecting according to the protocol. Now I know I'm definitely doing
something wrong. How were you guys able to implement this based on
just the JEP-0065?? Am I really that dense or is there another
document I should be looking at??

:<i>(((
</I>
Anyway, thanks for the assist so far... it's gotta be something stupid
in the way I'm implementing this but I can't see it for the life of
me...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At first, my understanding was that I should open a standard TCP

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redundant after I read paragraph [3] which states that I will have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open a SOCKS5 connection to that streamhost anyway, and in the
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it's not fully clear (and I'm simply reading from the quoted text you
</I>&gt;<i> provided), but what [3] is intended to mean is that you would perform the
</I>&gt;<i> SOCKS5 protocol over the established TCP connection from [1].  There are not
</I>&gt;<i> two connections.  I suppose it is spelled out in steps like this in case
</I>&gt;<i> you're writing your own SOCKS protocol code.  If you're using a SOCKS library
</I>&gt;<i> to perform the connection, which will both create the TCP connection as well
</I>&gt;<i> as negotiate the SOCKS5 protocol over it, then that's all you need to use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Proxy.setDefaultProxy(host, port); // sets SOCKS5 proxy to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 192.168.1.100:8010
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So this tells me that the actual SOCKS5 host to connect to is the SHA1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hash of sid + from + to and that the port is 0. That is why I have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following line in my code :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, just to ensure our terminology is clear, the SOCKS5 host (or proxy, or
</I>&gt;<i> server, or whatever) is 192.168.1.100.  The destination (or DST) host, ie the
</I>&gt;<i> one that you'll ask the SOCKS5 host to bridge you to, is the hash.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, you're aware that the hash is not a real host, and that the SOCKS5
</I>&gt;<i> host (in this example, Psi) is not actually going to perform an outbound
</I>&gt;<i> connection to the DST as a result.  It is simply used as a handshake.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Socket ss = new SocksSocket(SocksHost, 0);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My confusion with this line of code is that I don't see how it relates to the
</I>&gt;<i> Proxy object.  In other words, how does the SocksSocket know what SOCKS5 host
</I>&gt;<i> to connect to?  I know nothing about the library you're using though, so
</I>&gt;<i> maybe the Proxy object interfaces with some global settings in the
</I>&gt;<i> background, and SocksSocket draws from that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It could be that you understand the protocol, and are coding with the right
</I>&gt;<i> intent, but simply coding it wrong. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; p.s. btw Justin... great work on the PSI client!
