<PRE>Peter,

jsm/users.c user data caching.

as long as there is a session for a user, the cached user data will not be purged.
one all session go away you must wait as long as &lt;jsm&gt;&lt;usergc&gt;NNN&lt;/usergc&gt;&lt;/jsm&gt; seconds
for the cached user data to be discarded.

IMHO its an error to cache the password information at all.  its only needed at login.
so read the disk for each login of each user.

unfortunately the &quot;bounce user on null resource login&quot; depends upon the password being
in the user cache.  could be re-implemented with a flag/variable in the user data structure
rather than overloading the password field.

dealing with this here.  have some code that begins to address it.  issue i have right now
is that the register and change password code is intermixed...split that out.  have two 
controls in .xml file now.  (newuser=&quot;yes|no&quot;  changepassword=&quot;yes|no&quot;).

have to stop the code from disallowing the change but modifying disk anyway ;)

Jonathan

Subject: [jdev] jabberd 1.4.x password changing
 
At jabber.org (running jabberd 1.4.2cvs plus patches, it's a long story, 
don't ask), I see the following behavior with regard to password changes:

1. Log in with pw1, change password to pw2 (confirmed as changed in 
database), log out, successfully log in with pw2. All is happy.

2. Log in with pw1 as resource1, log in with pw1 as resource2, change 
password to pw2 from resource2 (confirmed as changed in database), log 
out of resource2, leave resource1 logged in, try to log in with pw2 as 
resource2, get 401 error (but can successfully log in with pw1 as 
resource2). Once I log out of resource1 (no more connected resources), I 
am then able to successfully log in with pw2.

So it seems that there is some kind of session caching happening, even 
though pgmillard confirms that we have all xdb caching turned off. Is 
there a way to configure jabberd 1.4 to not cache anything, do we need 
to finally and definitively upgrade to 1.4.3, or is this a bug?

Thanks!
