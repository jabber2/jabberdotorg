Hi all,

I was unable to find a clearly defined set of rules regarding this type of inquiry, so my apologies if it is unfounded in this community. I truly hope it is not viewed as spam in the community.

I am a tech recruiter based in NYC focused solely on the startup world. I work with organizations from inception through late-series funding, providing strategic support in identifying talent as they scale.

I am writing to share one of the most interesting and compelling opportunities I've come across in a while, which will be right for a certain type of individual that possesses a very specific skillset.

The organization that I am representing is an early doors startup on the verge of securing seed funding at a $10M valuation. They're currently 5 people, so it is an opportunity to get in very early, secure meaningful equity and scale the business.

The client has built a unique messaging app that will be first to market with UI, UX, features, etc. that are different than any existing options. The platform brings flexibility &amp; control to the user and is positioned as a &quot;no limits&quot; messenger.

The organization utilizes Erlang, XMPP, MongooseIM and Python for stitching. They have a massive back end, complex and scalable.

They're looking to speak with a strong Back End Engineer who will be integral in building and architecting their back end. Optimally, this will be an individual with messaging knowledge and experience building high traffic systems.

It is an exciting platform and the company is placing extremely high value on this role. It's an opportunity to be one of the first employees and have real measurable impact as they grow.

The company is based in NYC, but if relocation isn't your thing, they're also open to someone who can work remotely. There is one caveat: be in NYC for their launch!

Please let me know if you or anyone you may know fits this profile and would be interested to hear more.

Thank you for your time and considering this request. Happy holidays to all!

Best regards,

Jonathan Peters
