</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is something we are interested in doing as well. Our use case is that people could be involved in multiple discussions, but only actually want to join a room if something interesting is going on (for example, missed messages or a user joining the room). The Pubsub mechanism would provide a great choice for this as it means the node can be configured so that the client does not have to request any of this information, or join a room in order to receive updates.

I did some experiments around this some time back:
<A HREF="http://blog.prosody.im/multi-user-chat-gets-rich/">http://blog.prosody.im/multi-user-chat-gets-rich/</A>

However there are various approaches to tackling the problem, and I
gather that many people don't think mine was the best. We had a group
discussion on alternatives in Brussels in 2011, but again the
conclusion was that all approaches had drawbacks, some being
incredibly complicated - and so no consensus was reached.
