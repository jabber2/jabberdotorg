</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is something we are interested in doing as well. Our use case is that people could be involved in multiple discussions, but only actually want to join a room if something interesting is going on (for example, missed messages or a user joining the room). The Pubsub mechanism would provide a great choice for this as it means the node can be configured so that the client does not have to request any of this information, or join a room in order to receive updates.

</I>
The thread turned to PEP-in-MUC, aka MEP which is, in my
understanding, occupants publishing data to other occupants. You're
right, this isn't what the OP asked about, which is more linking a
pubsub node to a MUC.

To offer my 2p on that specific problem, it just sounds like some
custom server-side code is needed (probably in the MUC
implementation). Discovering the node is perhaps something that could
be solved at the protocol level, it's not the first time I've seen
people wanting to link pubsub nodes to MUC rooms (though with slightly
different goals - usually for in-room occupants to share data out of
band).

Matthew
