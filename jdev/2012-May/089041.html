<PRE>We do something vaguely similar, for example we log room leaves and joins for our analytics. Our chat server, openfire, has a lot of hooks into MUC to be able to do this.  

I guess another way is to have a bot in the room that would deal with sending the pub sub message. The bot could well be written as an external component, and that way you wouldn't be tied to the internal API of your server. The bot just listens to the various room events and does its thing. 

Bear in mind if you do use openfire the current released versions all have a pep memory leak, not sure if this applies to pub sub too.

That's just the way I would do it though!

Good luck
Michael

&gt;<i> Hi XMPPers,

</I>&gt;<i> I would like to be able to have certain information from a MUC available, in some fashion, to people who are not currently &quot;in&quot; the room. What exactly this information will be I am still sorting out and will be somewhat specific to my application anyway. But loosely I'm thinking that certain events inside the MUC will trigger a hook, which I will develop myself, that will pass the information over to a PubSub node. Individual users will be able to subscribe to this node and get sent the information, which will include the ID of the room it came from.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone doing something similar to this? As this is my first foray into PubSub, should I just read XEP-0060 and take it from there? Or are there other resources, online or elsewhere, that might be relevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
