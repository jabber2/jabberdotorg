</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, there are two things being discussed here:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Your use case and the need to limit the work done by the client on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> login. I think this is addressable for your deployment by limiting the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of rooms that need to be joined prior to there being activity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in them (or possibly by using pubsub nodes rather that MUC rooms,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> although this is not a clear win and requires you to do significantly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more client work).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Allowing servers to 'force' or 'autojoin' users into MUCs - this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a feature that's generally interesting and speccing it up seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sensible even if it won't help your cases (although it might, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combination with some new server code).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would certainly be nice to be able to get what ever saving is possible from the standards, as then everyone can benefit rather than focusing on application specific code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anything that can be done to minimise it will create more breathing room. By those estimates I'd say losing a 1/3 of the stanzas across the wire is a significant optimisation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right, it is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps the saving could be greater, why would there be 300+ back? If I were only the occupant, would I not just get my own presence back?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It'll receive presence from anyone in the room (I've not counted this)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its own presence (I did count this), any message history
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requested/sent (I've not counted this) and the room subject, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indicates the join is complete (I did count this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this possibly a great fit for the Pubsub/Muc hybrid. Clients can permanently subscribe selectively to things they are interested in. For example, I don't care about room subject, but presence and history I might care about. Having this information map on to nodes to the MUC jid gives very fine control over what information is required using an existing standard. Could the Pubsub/Muc hybrid simply come down to certain predefined mappings, plus room for arbitrary information.
</I>
You mean exposing the room as both a MUC and as MEP, both being a
representation onto the same data? That would certainly help in your
case. I wonder what other people think of it?
