I'm afraid this doesn't really help me understand why you want it  
listed here.

If PingPong requires its own client, then presumably it's not XMPP -  
or at least, if it's not allowing any client, then it's not the kind  
of XMPP service we normally list.

If talk.to requires that it's used with your service, then again it's  
not really the kind of client we'd list. Lots of service specific  
clients exist, and we don't list them because they're of no use to  
someone looking for an XMPP client to use with a service of their  
choice.

This isn't a reflection on your service, of course - it's simply it's  
not really the kind of thing we include there, just as we don't  
include other, similar services and clients. If we did, then services  
such as Evolve would be listed, and we'd list TextOne as well as  
OneTeam. All of these types of services and specialist clients are  
very interesting, and maybe the XSF should publish a round-up  
interview about the use of XMPP in these services, but it's not clear  
we should be listing them on these pages.

Dave.
