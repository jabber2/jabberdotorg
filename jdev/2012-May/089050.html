Well, golly, I'm amazed. How many rooms are we talking about?

&gt;<i> I imagine we are a fairly isolated in our application wanting clients to auto join rooms every time they connect, so there's no point in addressing this in the standard. However, linking in with the Muc/Pubsub (MEP?) could provide a great way to get around this issue, and be universally useful.
</I>
Well, most desktop clients are set to autojoin a bunch of rooms...

&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>
So the problem is only needing one class of user to be joined to
specific MUCs when someone from another class of user joins one?
There's a potential here (you control all clients, don't you?) to have
an intermediary know when class B users join a MUC so they can then
send invites to the appropriate class A users.
