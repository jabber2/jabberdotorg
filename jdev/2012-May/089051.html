It would certainly be nice to be able to get what ever saving is possible from the standards, as then everyone can benefit rather than focusing on application specific code.

&gt;&gt;<i> Anything that can be done to minimise it will create more breathing room. By those estimates I'd say losing a 1/3 of the stanzas across the wire is a significant optimisation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right, it is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps the saving could be greater, why would there be 300+ back? If I were only the occupant, would I not just get my own presence back?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It'll receive presence from anyone in the room (I've not counted this)
</I>&gt;<i> its own presence (I did count this), any message history
</I>&gt;<i> requested/sent (I've not counted this) and the room subject, which
</I>&gt;<i> indicates the join is complete (I did count this).
</I>
Is this possibly a great fit for the Pubsub/Muc hybrid. Clients can permanently subscribe selectively to things they are interested in. For example, I don't care about room subject, but presence and history I might care about. Having this information map on to nodes to the MUC jid gives very fine control over what information is required using an existing standard. Could the Pubsub/Muc hybrid simply come down to certain predefined mappings, plus room for arbitrary information.

&gt;&gt;<i> If a Pubsub/MUC/Pubsub Inbox hybrid were created then there could be further savings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Taking a higher level view, we use a combination of Pubsub/MUC to create different channels so that we can guarantee the right messages go to the right clients. XMPP gives us a bunch of neat features for dealing with this. However, at the moment the majority of our traffic is centred around setup, as opposed to the actual content - this does not seem sensible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This issue is certainly compounded on the web, where users may leave your site and return minutes later. However, I would have thought suggestions on limiting the amount of handshaking that is required to be done is universally beneficial.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not going to disagree.
