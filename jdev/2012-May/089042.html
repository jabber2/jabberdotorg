<PRE>Dan,

This is something we are interested in doing as well. Our use case is that people could be involved in multiple discussions, but only actually want to join a room if something interesting is going on (for example, missed messages or a user joining the room). The Pubsub mechanism would provide a great choice for this as it means the node can be configured so that the client does not have to request any of this information, or join a room in order to receive updates.

As Michael suggests, a bot is probably the most pragmatic way of solving this in the short term. Keep me posted on how  you get on!

Cheers

Theo

</I>&gt;<i> I would like to be able to have certain information from a MUC available, in some fashion, to people who are not currently &quot;in&quot; the room. What exactly this information will be I am still sorting out and will be somewhat specific to my application anyway. But loosely I'm thinking that certain events inside the MUC will trigger a hook, which I will develop myself, that will pass the information over to a PubSub node. Individual users will be able to subscribe to this node and get sent the information, which will include the ID of the room it came from.

</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone doing something similar to this? As this is my first foray into PubSub, should I just read XEP-0060 and take it from there? Or are there other resources, online or elsewhere, that might be relevant.
