There's no other sane and sensible way... But...

If, for some reason, you're unable to use non-blocking sockets, the 
solution is to ensure that data will be present within a short time 
period after you start to poll.

The simplest method for that would be to send an &lt;iq/&gt; before you 
poll. You want to send it somewhere that you can reasonably trust to 
respond, and you don't want it to harm anything, so I'd opt for a 
XEP-0199 to the server.

This is, of course, a major hack, and I'd much recommend avoiding it 
if at all possible.

Dave.
