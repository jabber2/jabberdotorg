<PRE>No, the problem is as follows. I want to get all my available  
contacts. To do so I send &lt;presence /&gt; stanza. The problem is that  
the script will hang here because there will be no reply from server  
if there are no users sharing there presence with me. In a few words  
I send a presence stanza and waiting for a reply which will never  
arrive because there are no contacts. As far as I understand PHP  
doesn't not support non-blocking SSL streams.
Is there a way that my presence will always return something or do I  
have to write everything in events and there is no other way?

thanks,
Sergej
