The 'standard' way of writing xmpp apps, is there's normally a central
loop somewhere that does the blocking receive and then the stanza is
dispatched to a set of event handlers.  Most frameworks offer the
ability to send a stanza and ask for your callback function to be
executed when you receive a reply with the same id.  (The 'pending'
call goes into a list which is check when incoming stanzas are
received, if the id's match then the callback method is executed)
