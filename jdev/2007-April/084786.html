Right. And nobody will argue with you on that point. As I mentioned a
few posts back we have all been talking about this on the Standards list
quite a bit and have made good progress. There is, however, the tactical
issue at hand which I believe this email is about: it will take
weeks/months/years for server changes to address ghosting to propagate
the net. Until then the client can use something like the IQ method I
mentioned before (sparingly) to make sure the other endpoint is still
available. Auto updates in clients make this happen much faster than
everyone hosting servers will do upgrades.
