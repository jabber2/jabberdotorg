<PRE>Francisco,

I'm actually the author of SleekXMPP.  I'm planning on getting the first
release (0.1) out this weekend, and it's quite stable.  However, it's still
in it's infancy and missing some important features like SASL DIGEST-MD5.
There is one project already using it, and I'm planning on starting a bot
framework.  Unfortunately, since I haven't had time to research licenses,
the first release will be GPL.  I am, however, perfectly willing to talk to
you about a commercial license, possibly free of charge.  I am planning on
using a less restrictive license for my 0.2 release.

As far as how it compares to other Python classes, I cannot tell you being
as I have purposely avoided reviewing them.  That is best left to other
developers to tell you (I would like to hear any criticism as well).
Documentation is very sparse, although I have started.  The idea behind the
class is that every XEP is a standalone, drop-in plugin.  One of the stated
goals is to eventually have a plugin for every draft XEP, although that is
quite a ways off.  I am taking care for the class to be very stable and deal
with connectivity issues cleanly.

Feel free to jabber or email me at fritzy at netflint.net.

Thanks,
