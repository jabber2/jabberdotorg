Yes, I see the point now. XMLSocket is limited to ports above 1024, so
this is another added benefit as well.

It seems to me that, if we were to try to make this a generalized proxy
for other clients besides Flash, we will still have to deal with the minor
issue of determining if it is a Flash client (or any other client that
appends a zero-byte to outgoing data) and if so, handling it accordingly.
I personally would like to see it generalized as well, so that it can be
of the greatest benefit to the community.

Now, the question is: Who, besides me, would like to continue the planning
phase and see this thing to fruition? I'd imagine we should take the
details of it all off-list at some point. I'll gladly organize the effort
if need be, but I acknowledge that my technical skills on the server side
are a bit lacking for me to implement a working version on my own.

A formalized publicly available document or JEP outlining the proxy
control protocol and the details of it all would of course be best -
allowing the open source community to have it's own implementation and
independent commercial vendors to have perhaps implementations that they
can bundle with their servers.
