Started this process already. It does little good, even though I'm
communicating with &quot;higher-ups&quot; in Macromedia because 1) it's a player
issue, so even if it's &quot;fixed&quot; it wouldn't be resolved until a new version
is released. And even then, it usually takes a year for the new version to
reach an acceptable penetration level. Flash 6 still has more share than
Flash 7 right now. Macromedia has more NDAs on me than I have fingers it
seems, so I'd like to say more about future versions but I can't.

Probably the best solution, backed by a full-fledged JEP of some sort.
Hosting the server isn't an issue because 1) due to Flash's security
sandbox it can only communicate with the same domain it's being hosted on
or domains that have a crossdomain.xml installed (which would have to be
negotiated with each server admin).

&gt;<i> Didnt I infer flash was better for quicking building simple UI's? The

</I>
OK - I acknowledge this was a misunderstanding. Flash is not a platform in
of itself. It's only the presentation layer, just pointing out it makes a
viable presentation layer for enterprise applications built in another
language, ie Java. I totally agree that it's insane to try to build your
business logic in Actionscript!

I'm not at all familiar with the process, so is a JEP the way to go? How
do these things get started?

Thanks,
