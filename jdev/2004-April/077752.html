<PRE>I agree with Sean,

We are using his XIFF library to connect to our Jabber Server that was
written in .NET.  Currently there is a Chat application and IM.  I am now
onto trying to develop a whiteboard.  All done in flash.

Something that you need to remember is that Flash movies are cross platform,
cross browser compatable.  Even more so than Java.  And it is even more
widely accepted.  Oh, and Flash is ADA compliant.

Honestly, unless you are deeply familiar with Flash's capabilities and its
community, I wouldn't comment on the fact that Flash isn't suited for
enterprise development!

Take a look at Macromedia Flex. Take a look at Convoq ASAP (built entirely
with Flash) and tell me it wouldn't be great with Jabber support alongside
the other IM protocols.

Flash is entirely well-suited for the rich-client portion of enterprise
development. It is not meant to supplant Java, but rather live along-side it
as the client of choice. Where I work we are building a multi-million dollar
enterprise application for the insurance industry that is Java on the
backend with a full Flash UI in a 3-tier system that interacts with the Java
business logic using J2EE remoting.

So, to say that Flash is not suited to enterprise development is clearly
wrong.

As for Jabber/XMPP, I know for a fact that there is growing support in the
Flash community to use Flash with XMPP. A good deal of this support was
initiated either by me, with the XIFF project, or by others being inspired
by the release of Gush. So, if Flash socket support never makes it into
Jabberd2, I'd say it's a loss for both sides, and XMPP needs all the help it
can get, IMO. With the eminent release of the AOL Presence SDK for
Macromedia Central, it's only a matter of time before Flash developers jump
on the presence/IM bandwagon, and I'd hate to see it limited to AIM.
