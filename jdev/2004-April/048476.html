Disallowing inband TLS in JEP-0124 resulted from a desire to respect
proper protocol layering. Since HTTP does TLS/SSL, that seemed like the
right layer for channel encryption. Changing &quot;MUST NOT&quot; to &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;
(or simply encouraging use of TLS at the HTTP layer) might be OK with
me, I'd have to think about it some more (the primary authors of this
spec were originally DizzyD and now mostly Ian Paterson so I'd like to
hear what they think).

Ian is working on a new version, which should be out soon.
