<PRE>A little over a month ago, the Jabber Council agreed that it would be
desirable to advance several JEPs from Draft to Final if the Jabber 
community deems them to be stable and well-received. The first of them 
was JEP-0030 (Service Discovery), for which the Call for Experience has 
been completed. The second was JEP-0077 (In-Band Registration). 

Therefore, as JEP Editor I would like to issue a Call for Experience on 
JEP-0077. To help the Jabber Council decide whether this JEP is ready 
to advance to a status of Final, the JSF would like to gather the 
following information:

1. Who has implemented JEP-0077? I realize that the list is probably 
quite long, since in-band registration has been around for a long time
and is considered a fairly &quot;core&quot; feature, but a list of implementations
would be appreciated. (But probably I can just go to the software pages 
at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/software/">http://www.jabber.org/software/</A>&gt; for a list.)

2. Have implementers experienced any problems with the protocol as
defined in JEP-0077? If so, please describe the problems and, if
possible, suggested solutions.

3. Is the text of JEP-0077 clear and unambiguous? Are more examples
necessary? Is the conformance language (MAY/SHOULD/MUST) appropriate?
Have implementers found the text confusing at all? Please describe any
suggestions you have for improving the text.

If you have any comments on this JEP, please provide them by the close
of business on May 10, at which time the Call for Experience will end. 
After the Call for Experience, this JEP may undergo revisions to address
feedback received, after which it will be presented to the Jabber 
Council for voting to a status of Final.

You may review the JEP here:

Please send all feedback to &lt;standards-jig at jabber.org&gt;.
