<PRE>    hello, everyone, first I will appreciate your kindness to read my 
letter, and I need your help very much! Thanks!

    I'm a student from Software School, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, 
and I'm interested in mobile software development for years, and recently 
I'm addicted in jabber, the most powerful and promising IM protocol. I have 
read a lot of materials about jabber everywhere and have tried many 
clients(both on PC and mobile), now I want to develop a jabber client on 
the mobile, but I am facing some difficulty which prevents me from moving 
forward.
 
    As is known to all, Jabber server supports only socket connection to 
the client, however, for the time being, the majority of the java mobile 
devices on the market are based on MIDP1.0, thus supports only HTTP 
connection, as a result, the mobile jabber client cannot connect to the 
jabber server directly, that's to say, a web server ------ mobile gateway 
needs to be set up between the jabber server and mobile clients. I've found 
some commercial companies which have integrated mobile clients to the whole 
platform are using this method to support mobile clients. 

    Now that the mobile gateway is needed, how can I design the mobile 
gateway? Should the mobile gateway acts as an virtual client and opens 
hundreds of socket connections to the jabber server? In this way, each 
socket connection is mapped into a remote mobile client user, and each 
connection requires several threads(write thread, read thread, listening 
thread, etc.). Is this reasonable? Is it possible to create hundreds of new 
threads in web containers such as Tomcat? Or is there any other solutions? 
I need your help!! Thanks!!

                                                                   crazyII
