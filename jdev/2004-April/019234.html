<PRE>Hi,

   there is another thing, which got me hooked. It is open for 
commercial as non-commercial use.

   I work in a team of 20 developers and got us set up with the Yahoo 
Messenger some time ago. And apart from the Yahoo Messenger being crap 
(messages are sometimes delivered after hours) somebody on the project 
raised that one of their clauses in the terms of usage might say that we 
are not allowed to use it in a commercial environment.

   I double-checked and didn't read it that way, but it might very well 
be. As we are from a major consultancy and can't risk using unlicensed 
software and the client we are working for on-site is not really into 
this &quot;new kind of stuff&quot;, so that we couldn't have asked for a pruchase 
of some commercial license.

   We got rid of the Yahoo Messenger and set up our own Jabber server 
with team chat rooms. And now things work like a breeze and we can chose 
from a variety of different clients.

   Oh, and btw. it was so nice to build a simple chat bot with a couple 
of lines of code that still entertained us enormously ;-)

   Well, just to justify that the last point is not only funny. Because 
it is so effortles to work with jabber (just a handfull of lines of code 
to send messages) our automated tasks, e.g. our automatic build results, 
now report directly to the chat room instead of sending a message by 
email. This is a very good thing as you can just ignore the messages 
when the server is going to go down if you don't need and it won't waste 
your mail account so. As our team head count is due to (a lack of) 
planning is constantly reduced and increased, it was a real pain to 
change all the scripts every time somebody new came on board, read 
didn't happen every time, was often asymetric. Nowadays new guys just 
register themselves at our server and they are all setup to get the 
relevant messages.

   As it is so open, the barries are so low and there are already 
pre-built components, I am currently working on building a Jabber client 
for our favorite IDE (eclipse).

   What I see as a downside is that I haven't been able to get my hands 
on a very simple Jabber Server written in Java that you can run embedded 
for automated tests. It's also a bit of a pain to setup jabberd, but 
this are luxury problems, as with for example the Yahoo Messenger you 
wouldn't have the choice to setup your own server.

   It would be interesting to know what you're up to ...

Cheers,
Mariano

</I>&gt;<i> For IM?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Advantages:
</I>&gt;<i>   Many clients to choose from, all no less official than another
</I>&gt;<i>   Distributed architecture (if one server goes down, the rest keep going)
</I>&gt;<i>   Secure (encryption available, run your own private server, etc)
</I>&gt;<i>   Limitless expansion (many neat things are possible with Jabber these days)

</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantages:
</I>&gt;<i>   Not well known, not as many users
</I>&gt;<i>   Slow development (most Jabber efforts have limited funding)
</I>&gt;<i>   File transfer not widely implemented
</I>&gt;<i>   No audio/video integration standard (ie, voicechat)
</I>&gt;<i>   Nothing available analogous to <A HREF="http://www.icq.com/">http://www.icq.com/</A>
