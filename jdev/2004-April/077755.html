<PRE>I can definitely appreciate your arguments.  However, three things 
conspire against us all:

1)  The entire XMPP stream is a complete XML document, the specs of 
which do not permit the NULL character anywhere within the document itself.
2)  Flash does not currently seem to accept this, since it wants a 
complete XML &quot;document&quot; with each reciept.*
3)  Jabberd2 aims to be an open reference implementation of the 
XMPP-Core and XMPP-IM RFCs.

Both Flash and XMPP (often in the form of the protocols managed and 
published by the Jabber Software Foundation) are clearly gaining 
traction, especially in enterprise environments.

 From what I've seen so far, here are the possible paths I see we can 
follow to resolve this:
1)  Lobby Macromedia to provide better support for XMPP
2)  Lobby the jabberd2 project to provide better support for Flash
3)  Develop alternatives to direct XMPP streams

Option #1 is highly unlikely to result in anything in the short term.  
Option #2 would have a better shot, but since adding the NULL terminator 
violates the XMPP specs (by way of the XML specs), this also looks 
highly unlikely.  Option #3 is probably the most-realistic compromise at 
this time, since it does not violate any of the existing specs.

For Option #3, I believe there is already something in the works, in the 
form of JEP-0124: HTTP Binding.  It's not ideal, but given the fact that 
it can much more easily accomodate the demands from both XMPP and 
Flash.  The problem, of course, is that JEP-0124 is still rather 
immature, and lacks any truly deployable implementations.  Then again, 
if the Flash-XMPP/Jabber community does not feel this is adequate, they 
are welcome to present better alternatives.

In the short term, it is probably best to stick with some version of 
jabberd-1.4, since it already has the compatibility in place.  Longer 
term, it is very likely that HTTP-binding will be the &quot;best&quot; solution, 
unless options 1 and/or 2 result in anything productive.

These, of course, are just my thoughts and opinions.

*  This is based on what I've been reading, since I have very little 
experience developing anything in Flash.

</I>&gt;<i>Flash is entirely well-suited for the rich-client portion of enterprise

</I>&gt;<i>Macromedia Central, it's only a matter of time before Flash developers jump
