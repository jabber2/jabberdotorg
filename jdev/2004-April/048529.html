Hmm.. what kind of WV support are you talking about? There are plenty of 
phones (not just from Motorola) that support the Wireless Village API in 
J2ME. That still doesn't give you instant messenger though, or even an 
instant messenger API! Often it's most usefull as an API to send SMS 
messages with.

There are proposals for an instant messaging for Java (such as JAIN), but 
these are meant to be protocol agnostic, with WV being just one of the 
protocols you could use for it.

If aware of a few applications that use the WV API to build an instant 
messenger, but there are a dozen more that use Jabber. I'm pretty sure 
most device manufactorers have an implementation too, that they can put on 
the phone if the operators request it. (However, again the same is true 
for Jabber!)

That's the thing, you don't just need the API support, and an instant 
messenger that uses it. You also need support from your operator, which as 
far as I know is still very rare.

So have you been in the situation where you have a handset in your hand, 
with the WV API and a messenger that uses it, and been able to use it 
cause your operator supports it? Or have you read on some spec. sheets 
that WV is &quot;supported&quot;?
