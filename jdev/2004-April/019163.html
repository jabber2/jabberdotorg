<PRE>Hi guys,

I'm a developer who's relatively new to Jabber and IM. I've toyed with
both over the years but nothing more than that. 

A client of mine has an idea for a application that I think I can use
Jabber for, as a development platform.  I spent last night looking
around the site and the docs to see if what I want to do is feasible,
but there was a low signal-to-noise ratio since one of my search terms
include &quot;modify message&quot;.

Here's the scenario:  Jabber server is installed on a linux box, Jabber
clients on Win2K boxen.  User A sends an IM to User B that reads &quot; B, be
sure to call Faber today&quot;.  The Jabber server gets the messages, adds it
to a MySQL Database retrieving the unique ID, and sends a modified
messages of &quot;&quot;B, be sure to call Faber today. _Done_ _Delegated_
_Canceled_&quot; where &quot;_Done_ _Delegated_ _Canceled_&quot; are three hyperlinks.
Clicking on the hyperlinks will execute some CGI or something on the
server (using the unique ID from the database), marking the task as
done, delegated or canceled.

The reason we want to use IM is for the interface; we want something
that's fast to enter data (Alt-tab to Jabber client, type in data,
Alt-Tab back to previous app) and is updated in (more or less) realtime.
We could do this with a web page, but using IM seems faster and leaner,
not to mention slick. :-)

So, can Jabber be _easily_ modified to do this or is it a major
undertaking require thousands of man-hours?  I'm hoping there's a hook
or hooks into the system that would allow the &quot;log to database&quot; and
&quot;modify message&quot; but I didn't see anything like that.

TIA.
