<PRE>&gt;<i> - I assume jabber clients which implements JEP-0025 send a heartbeat packet
</I>every so often.  Are these HTTP connections typically (re)opened for each
heartbeat?  I am looking to scale my application to 10K+ users, so would it be
better to reopen the socket for a heartbeat or to keep a HTTP 1.1 persistent
connection open?

This is really up to you. I think it'll work both ways. I have a stand alone
HTTP Polling server that runs with apache, so I guess it is up to apache to
keep the connection alive.
 
&gt;<i> - If i'm running a jabber client over HTTP (instead of socket 5522/tcp)
</I>&gt;<i> how often should the client send a heartbeat, since there isn't any way for
</I>the jabber server &quot;push&quot; a message to me from another peer in-between
sends/heartbeat packets.

As often as you want. What ever seems to work. I think some client does it
ever sec and some does 10 sec.

&gt;<i> - I looked at the list of servers and code libraries at jabber.org, but it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't look like any of the open source ones implement JEP-0025 or any sort
</I>of firewall-piercing technology.  Could someone confirm this?  If there are
any, I'd like to get ahold of the code and see how they do it.

What do you exactly mean by firewall piercing technology??? The only reason
you would need to use JEP-0025 is if you are on a firewall that only allows
HTTP connection outgoing.

I've implemented a JEP-0025 standalone server. JEP-0025 is just a tunneling
system, so it doesn't really have to be built into the server.
