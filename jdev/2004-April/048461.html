Ok maybe, I ve not been precised enought, what I am talking about is RIA 
- Rich Internet Application-
which involve as its name suggests a Rich Client, communicating to a 
enterprise-backend (in most case
Java). When you say it's a bad idea, it's a really personnal judgement 
since I m using Flash as a RIA
framework for about one year now, with Cocoon on the backend (Open 
Source XML Publishing
Framework ) and the two are playing together happily so far.  Now if you 
follow the emerging trends,
you'll certainly notice that Macromedia is currently dominating the RIA 
market, and the demand on
the employement market begin to appear. I m not playing the Flash 
advocate since my developments
are mostly based on open-source components, but at the moment, there is 
no real alternative on this
front, and MM just took some advance with it's last product called Flex
&lt;/not-really-on-topic&gt;

Now there are three ways for a Flash Client to talk to communicate with 
its environnement.

1. HTTP
2. Flash Communication Server (costly)
3. XMLSocket based server (Unity, Jabber 1.4)

Flash Communication Server is not really affordable, so XMLSocket is the 
only real solution
for real-time communication. Sean Voisen with its XIFF project recently 
demonstrated how powerful
the combination of Jabber and Flash could be, and my point is it would 
be sad to see so much of
nice perspectives being cut-down in the coming version of Jabber.

Now one question remaining is, what does the Jabber protocol say about 
that? Is terminating
strings sent back to the client by a null character comes in 
contradiction with the protocol?
Or is terminating the Stanza by a backslash is just a hack and clearly 
not allowed by the protocol.
If this is the case, I can understand your point, and I m sure there is 
some workaround possible
outside the server (implementing a proxy that do the transformation).
Otherwise....
I dont have enought knowledge about the Jabberd2 architecture and 
implementation, but may
be there is a clean way to do things? Any thoughts?

Kind Regards,

Johann
