This now seems OT, and it's not my job to try to convince you that Flash
is more than you think it is but:

1) Flash is not limited to XMLSockets. It has full access to SOAP,
WebServices and AMF, a binary remoting format. We use AMF remoting to
connect to our Java services, running on JBoss, to transmit DTOs back and
forth with seamless translation of the binary objects between both sides.
The only thing I use XMLSocket for is Jabber.

2) Flash is better for complex UIs, especially since development time is
much faster. You can't build in JSP/Struts what you can in Flash. And
Swing isn't even worth discussing, as it's a complete pain. The
application we're building is extremely complex and massive in scale, so
it can be done. And with Macromedia Flex now available, it's even better.

3) Flash rich clients are faster and smaller than something equivalent
built with Java.

Here's a comprehensive article on why Flash is better than Swing:
