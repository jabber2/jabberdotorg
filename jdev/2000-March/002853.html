<PRE>'m ready to jump on the Java bandwagon and should probably be posting to the
Java 'Mailing Lists' page but <A HREF="http://java.jabber.org/jab/lists.html">http://java.jabber.org/jab/lists.html</A> doesn't
have a subscription link to it so new joins probably haven't happened for
awhile.  I'll post the same/similar there but wanted to make sure I reach
anyone that might be available to help me (or me help them) on a Jabber Java
client. 

After browsing the jabber site, reading 6 months of jdev and java-dev
archives, talking to x &amp; y,,, am I correct in assuming the main tools I'll
have available to user are:
a) Java - webb, full featured library functions, 85% complete, erbo working
on)
b) Java - mass, light weight library functions, % complete, mass working on)

&lt;dscott intro&gt;
I've just completed some work on some bandaids for a jabber client applet
used by SmallOffice.com.  They are using jabber v0.6, the client requires
extra keepalive windows, doesn't synchronize methods correctly,,,, in other
words the code isn't something to build on.  If anything from the V0.6 looks
promising for V1.x clients there's no problem making it available.

I'm relatively new to Java, Linux, Apache, Open Source,, but don't plan to
be for very long.  I'd like to 
1) start with a bare bones Java client (roster, send, receive) to get my
feet wet(ter), 
2) build up to a JabberIM like client
3) keep building to a Winjab like client :)
&lt;/dscott intro&gt;

Any old/new timers have any recommendations on my next step being solo or
has anyone else started down this trek already (with the new libraries)?
