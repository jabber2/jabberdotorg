<PRE>At first I have to say that I don't speak on behalf of Netscape, but in my
personal name.
I've followed the jabber mailing list since one month, because I'm interested
in the project (but as many of you have little time to devote to it).
2 years ago I played a lot with the previous version of Netscape Calendar
Server (3.0 I think) and got interested in the emerging standards.
It seems that the standards are much more mature now.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, the problem of providing access to a calendar store via jabber

</I>&gt;<i> the bulk of work to be done implementing the CS and CUA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not to be discouraging, I just don't think the communication layer is the
</I>&gt;<i> hard part with scheduling.(or I could simply be being too short-sighted)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree with that.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Some urls for it:
documentation at <A HREF="http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/calendar.html">http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/calendar.html</A>
I don't think it is free (not sure about that), but you can download a test
drive at
<A HREF="http://www.iplanet.com/downloads/download/index.html">http://www.iplanet.com/downloads/download/index.html</A>

I think it's standards compliant but I haven't played with it yet.

Opinions are my own.

&quot;Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said: `The flag is moving.'
The other said: `The wind is moving.'
The sixth patriach happened to be passing by. He told them: `Not the wind, not
the flag; mind is moving.'&quot;
