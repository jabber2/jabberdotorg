<PRE>I think this would be a really cool thing to have. I also think that this
would be something to really help people understand that jabber is a 'lot
more' than just an instant messaging protocol.

Unfortunately, I also have zero time at the moment, and probably won't have
a chance to do anything but voice opinions and insights on any new projects
until the second week of May :)

Could this be implemented as an interface to a calendar server, with
(authorized) people adding and (even more authorized people) removing
appointments in a scheduler, with notification messages sent to the user
both when the schedule changed and when the user has requested
'notification' of something, say a meeting?

Can you toss me a few links, protocols etc ?

Subject: [JDEV] iCalendar project?



I read something somewhere about a vCard namespace
for jabber.  Has anyone talked about implementing
an iCalendar project?

Network calendaring seems to be very proprietary
at the moment and the iCalendar protocol is being
implemented at the speed of night, or so it seems.

I've tried several times over the past couple of
years to find some kind of network calendar server
and client that will allow the users in the department
some kind of network based calendaring.  But the
only solutions I've found are expensive and mostly
NT based.  I've been following Jabber development,
as a background process, for a while now and was
thinking that this might be a really kewl way
to get network schedules implemented.  Any thoughts?
