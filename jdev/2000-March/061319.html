<PRE>Does Jabber support anything like aliases/forwarding?  I have a multiple
daemons running that listen to Jabber accounts, I would like to be able
to identify one of those to be a master daemon that the others can send
messages to without knowing which exact daemon they are contacting.  I
just want them to be able to talk to &quot;configMaster&quot; and get the
information they need.  That alias could change from one daemon to
another depending on what happens in the future of this project, but it
would only be one daemon that would be listening to the alias at one
time.

Basically I want all of the other daemons to be able to send a message
to account &quot;A&quot; and have those messages delivered to account &quot;B&quot; and have
&quot;B&quot; handle them as if it were &quot;A&quot;.  And then be able to say that account
&quot;A&quot; is now pointing to account &quot;C&quot; and have it handle them.  All without
having to do anything special in my base code.  I would rather B just
reply to the sender's message with the appropriate ID set and have the
sender read it as if A had sent it back.
