<PRE>The Jabber 0.9 Server release is available!

<A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/dists/0.9/final/">http://download.jabber.org/dists/0.9/final/</A>


Features available with the Jabber Architecture:

--&gt; Services (ICQ, AIM, Yahoo, MSN, SMTP, IRC)
Services can transparently operate on a user's behalf to provide
connectivity, presence, and messaging with an alternate messaging system.
Clients do not need to individually support or have knowledge of these
services, and do not need to be changed when services are upgraded or
added.

--&gt; XML
All components of the Architecture are implemented using XML for
flexibility and compatibility.  Any piece or packet of information can be
extended with additional XML data for custom applications or features.

--&gt; Multiple Connections
Jabber supports multiple connections from any individual user, so you may
use the same account for home, office, and while traveling without worry.

--&gt; Distributed
Messages are routed between servers much in the same way that Email is.
Once you send a message to another user, your server will locate their
server and deliver the message.  Anyone can install and operate a server
for company or home/personal use.

--&gt; Firewall Friendly
Clients connect directly to the server, which interoperates with most
common firewalls transparently.  Simple port redirection or a NAT will
allow a client to function in a more limited environment.

--&gt; Subscription-based Presence system
Presence within Jabber uses a subscription model, allowing any two
entities to exchange one-time presence or subscribe to the other entity
for future presence notifications.  All subscriptions must be acknowledged
by the user before allowed, so the Jabber user has full control over who
receives their presence.

--&gt; Groupchat
Services can additionally handle groupchat messages for public and private
chat rooms involving any number of users.


Features available within the Jabber Server:

--&gt; Modular/API Server
There are three APIs within the server allowing any aspect of it to be
extended or altered.  In fact, most of the functionality within the server
is itself written as a modular component via these APIs.

--&gt; Flexible Client Access
Clients can connect directly with XML and only need to understand the
level of features they support.  The server also directly understands IRC,
HTTP, and Telnet allowing users to choose existing software to use as
their Jabber client.

--&gt; Real-time and Offline Messaging
The server delivers all messages instantly to any connected clients, and
will optionally retain messages offline until the user connects again.

--&gt; Rate Limits
The server attempts to moderate the rate of connections from a single
host, and the volume of traffic from a user.

--&gt; DSO Loadable Modules
Modules can be dynamically loaded for easier server administration and
added flexibility.


Clients/Libraries:

--&gt; Win32 <A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/win32/">http://download.jabber.org/win32/</A>
WinJab is a very advanced and fully functional client with a developer
interface.  Jabba is a fully functional client with fewer options and an
alternate interface.  Wijits are extremely simple client with minimal
functionality.  JabberCOM is also available for instant Jabber
functionality within many development tools for custom applicaitons.

--&gt; Linux/Unix
Gabber (<A HREF="http://gabber.sourceforge.net/">http://gabber.sourceforge.net/</A>) is a Gnome/GTK client with full
roster/messaging support and full advanced features in developemnt.
Kjabber is a KDE/QT client in development for KDE2.
jabberx is the curses client included with libjabber.
josh is a suite of shell tools for managing a Jabber account from the
command line and within scripts.

--&gt; Macintosh
There is some initial development at <A HREF="http://mac.jabber.org/">http://mac.jabber.org/</A> but we're
looking for more developers to help with a good Mac client.

--&gt; Perl
XML::Stream and Net::Jabber are available on CPAN and being actively
developed.

--&gt; Python
PyJabber contains many tools to make using Jabber from python easy,
<A HREF="http://python.jabber.org/.">http://python.jabber.org/.</A>

--&gt; TCL/TK
TCL libraries are available at <A HREF="http://tcl.jabber.org/">http://tcl.jabber.org/</A> and being updated
for the 0.9 server.  zABBER is a fully functional TCL/TK Jabber client
that should work on any platform.

--&gt; Mozilla
A fully skinnable XP client is being integrated with Mozilla using XUL and
CSS, look for more news in April on this effort.



@jabber.org is available with open registration and running 0.9 and
usually AIM, ICQ, and Yahoo as they are being tested/developed.  Report
any problems to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bugs at jabber.org</A> or join us in #jabber on
irc.openprojects.net.

Thanks, and kudos to the rest of the development team!
