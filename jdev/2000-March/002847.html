<PRE>Being quite familar w/ Jabber, but not at with CAP, I check it out at ietf.org,
and I have to agree with Kellan. It looks like CAP provides a standard for
storing and dealing w/ Calendar related data, but you'd still need the store
(CS) and some kind of CUA (this _could_ be implemented into an existing Jabber
client I suppose).

You'd probably want to use some kind of existing CS if one already exists and
just create another transport for it. This would make stuff go from CAP -&gt; XML.
But again, you'd still not a bulk of stuff on either end of the Jabber
implementation. You can easily pass stuff back and forth using either IQs or &lt;x&gt;
tags though.

&gt;<i> I agree, the speed (or lack there of) of the iCal project over the last
</I>&gt;<i> several years has certainly been frustrating, though I've high hope for
</I>&gt;<i> CAP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would you use jabber and iCal together?  The most obvious way would be
</I>&gt;<i> as a transport layer, i.e. create a jabber implementation of iTip. This
</I>&gt;<i> would be relatively simple once you had an iCal parser, and an agreed upon
</I>&gt;<i> method of representing iCal in XML.  And there is the rub.  vCard has an
</I>&gt;<i> XML DTD, and while it has been suggested that iCal move to XML this
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion has been met with strong resistance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, the problem of providing access to a calendar store via jabber
</I>&gt;<i> would not be all that difficult(ala CAP) but this still leaves you with
</I>&gt;<i> the bulk of work to be done implementing the CS and CUA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not to be discouraging, I just don't think the communication layer is the
</I>&gt;<i> hard part with scheduling.(or I could simply be being too short-sighted)
