<PRE>I agree, the speed (or lack there of) of the iCal project over the last 
several years has certainly been frustrating, though I've high hope for
CAP.

How would you use jabber and iCal together?  The most obvious way would be
as a transport layer, i.e. create a jabber implementation of iTip. This
would be relatively simple once you had an iCal parser, and an agreed upon
method of representing iCal in XML.  And there is the rub.  vCard has an
XML DTD, and while it has been suggested that iCal move to XML this
suggestion has been met with strong resistance.

Similarly, the problem of providing access to a calendar store via jabber
would not be all that difficult(ala CAP) but this still leaves you with
the bulk of work to be done implementing the CS and CUA.

Not to be discouraging, I just don't think the communication layer is the
hard part with scheduling.(or I could simply be being too short-sighted)

ps. Steeve, Have you checked out iPlanet(nee Netscape)'s Calendar Server?
I haven't looked at it yet, but its supposed to be free, and standards
compliant.
