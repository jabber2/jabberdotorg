<PRE>No that's not what I'm looking for.  What I'm looking for is a way to
have the server know that jabber id &quot;jabber:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at jabber.org</A>&quot; is really
&quot;jabber:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">vila at jabber.org</A>&quot;.  So that all things sent to
&quot;jabber:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at jabber.org</A>&quot; are instead delivered to
&quot;jabber:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">vila at jabber.org</A>&quot;.

That way I can tell one of the daemons that they are the acting master
and they tell the jabber server that they want to login in as
&quot;daemon1234&quot;, but they are also listening to &quot;daemonMaster&quot;.  Then all
messages sent to &quot;daemonMaster&quot; will handled by &quot;daemon1234&quot;.  

I've done this using a forwarding client listening to &quot;daemonMaster&quot;
that looks for an X tag in my namespace that tells who sent the
message.  &quot;daemonMaster&quot; then takes the same message and ships it out to
&quot;daemon1234&quot;.  &quot;daemon1234&quot; has to parse the X tag and look for my
forwarding tag to see who to send the reply to.  This is not a good
solution, but it works for now.

Other uses for this include a Help Desk organization where they have a
&quot;Help Desk&quot; id and various people monitor it at different times.  The
person who is supposed to be monitoring it tells the server that &quot;Help
Desk&quot; is now aliased to &quot;Ryan Eatmon&quot; and the server sends all messages
to &quot;Help Desk&quot; to &quot;Ryan Eatmon&quot; instead.  There can be lots of uses for
this feature.

You could even have it so that you can alias multiple ids to one id and
then round robin the messages to the various ids that it receives.  This
way you could write a distributed client that has ten daemons listening
on one address.  Or ten help desk employees listening to one Jabber
address.
