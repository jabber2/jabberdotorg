I certainly hope so, because I think we would need it.

Just as importantly, I think we'll need to get the support of the
developers on the KDE and GNOME projects.  If a Jabber based printing
solution was integrated into them there's a lot greater chance of it
gaining acceptance.  (and we can't forget the command line either)

But before we can do that we need to define some specifications.  One of
the things we'd need defined is an XML schema for requesting and reporting
printer status and capabilities.  I'll need to look around to see if I can
find if a similar schema has already been defined.

Also, I'll work on finishing up the proposal I was working on and then
post it to the web so everybody can take a look at it and comment on it.
