<PRE>The 0.9RC Jabber Server is immediately available at
<A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/dists/0.9/RC/">http://download.jabber.org/dists/0.9/RC/</A>

Development has progressed quickly and the following is a summary of the
important changes since pre3:

  * etherxd is gone, all of the etherx functionality is now in libetherx
and starts with the server (you just start jserver)

  * the 'jabber:' prefix was voted away, and is now no longer used in the
server. (you can send it, you just won't get it back)

  * a vcard-temp namespace is included and supported by the server, the
temporary vCard-XML syntax should be very close to the next official
proposal, more info at <A HREF="http://protocol.jabber.org/vcard-temp/">http://protocol.jabber.org/vcard-temp/</A>

  * agents now contain a &lt;service&gt;type&lt;/service&gt; for better identification
of what services are available programatically.

  * the irc service now supports the &lt;show/&gt; element in presence, and
fixes a few roster naming bugs and large message handling

  * the server will respond to iq:version and iq:time

  * more rigorous technical and end user documentation is in development,
keep your eye out for more announcements

Usernames and hostnames are now checked for invalid characters.  
Hostnames are folded to lowercase by the server and restricted to valid
dns characters only.  Usernames are limited to 64 characters and cannot
contain control characters, whitespace, or @:&amp;&lt;&gt;'&quot; characters.  Usernames
are also compared case insensitively within the server, but the case is
not changed.

The build system has had a *complete* overhaul(thanks temas!), and is now
very flexible and intelligent about managing the various componenets
within the server.  Please take it for a test run on any *nix platform and
report any problems.

*Please* install and test the 0.9RC server, we'll fix any reported
problems/issues and release the official 0.9 this week.  The plan is to
concentrate on the libraries, clients, and transports for a group 1.0
release in the next few weeks.  So if you have any issues or problems with
the 0.9 server, *let us know* since we are not planning any major
development on this codebase between 0.9 and 1.0!

Thanks!

Jer
