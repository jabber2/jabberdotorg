<PRE>Hmm... documentation links don't seem to work.

I have been a 'silent' member of this list for a while, and want to get your feedback on a technology I have been experimenting with.  It's called Instant Messaging Extensible Markup Language (IMXML); it allows anyone to create applications and publish content via IM networks.   It's basically a 'chat bot' language but because it's XML based it is easy for anyone to create a chat bot.  It is also web-based so you can use the majority of the code used to create an HTML application when producing an IMXML application.  You can check it out at www.imxml.org, or at www.sourceforge.net/projects/imxml.  I believe an open language like this will add value to the Jabber IM network by giving the user something they can't get on anyother network.


A brief background:
I began this project after I built an IM Bot and friends began asking for more and more features; after a while the code got extremely complex.  So turned to XML and developed IMXML; this made it much easier to create new IM Bot applications.  The first version was written in PERL, and then I wrote another version in Java that was based on a distributed architecture.  Since I worked for AOL at the time, I essentially kept IMXML to myself (I stress 'worked'... recently I was 'reorganized' :-( ... so now I am a Comp Sci. grad. student at Johns Hopkins Univ.).  Then I re-architected the Java version and wrote a rudimentary Jabber interface (Thanks to Al Sutton's Jabber Library :-) !!!) and am releasing it to the public.  If there is some demand for it then I'll continue to develop it, with help from interested people.  In any event, I'll be using it as a platform to research and study lan! guage grammar parsers.


The version available on Source Forge is a 'single server', meaning that the entire application is self-contained.  As opposed to the distributed version, which would require running at least two processes and setting up MySQL (Oracle or some DB).  In fact since the compact version was written after the distributed version the code for the single server is a LOT cleaner (albeit the single server code is still in a proof-of-concept stage).  Anyway, I encourage you to take a look at the website imxml.org; download the jar file from SourceForge; and enjoy!  The server is preconfigured to use the Stock quotes application on my web site.  Just start the server and send your bot the message 'quotes'.

Any questions feel free to e-mail me.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Thanks,

Rashad Moore
