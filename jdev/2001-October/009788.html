Hoorah!  I also agree that convenience and ease of use are just as 
important as &quot;security&quot; when designing real world systems (except when 
working for the NSA or other places where they can expect you to go through 
the extra hassles of &quot;solid security&quot;).  The trick really is to balance the 
two forces... hopefully allowing users the ability to adjust how secure 
they need to be (but even that introduces complexity and so may not be 
desirable).

I have been thinking that perhaps we should look at jabber security (and 
SSO) in a different light.  Right now, sign-on is equivalent to unlocking 
the gates.  Once inside, we have unlimited access to whatever we're 
authorized to do.  It is all or nothing and you have to unlock the gate to 
do anything.

But signing on to a Jabber server really isn't that big a deal.  So you use 
up a connection on the server.  Is that really that important?  And what 
about updating presence.  Is it that disastrous that someone can overcome 
your sign-on and make it look like you're online?  For most the answer is no.

So perhaps it should be simple simple simple to sign on, update presence, 
and send/read &quot;insecure&quot; messages.  Like web browsing.

It should be a little more difficult to read and send secure messages 
(confidentiality and nonrepudation (signatures)... where most people are 
concerned about security).

And it should be hard to break in (and a little more work to use) &quot;really 
secure&quot; things like digital wallets when we have that on jabber.

This seems to suggest a &quot;key ring&quot; with various keys (credentials) and 
differing levels of security.  Name and password say to signon once (this 
is not that valuable a sign on but is universal and simple... SSO).  Then 
the client must use a separate key (perhaps requiring another passphrase) 
to decrypt/encrypt &quot;secure messages&quot;. Finally, a separate passphrase and 
separate security system to transact financial exchange...

I wonder if it is practical.
