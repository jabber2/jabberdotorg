I'm not sure -- that is the example given at 
<A HREF="http://nuthole.homeip.net/howto/how-to-xdb_sql">http://nuthole.homeip.net/howto/how-to-xdb_sql</A> -- I assume some overlap 
is necessary, for the things that xdb_sql can't handle (like the user 
prefs that JIM sends).

</I>&gt;<i> to remove the vcard, you just need to remove the vcard-temp namespace
</I>&gt;<i> from the xdb section.
</I>

I tried that, but then JIM just wouldn't start up.

At any rate, now that nuthole.homeip.net is back up, I was able to get 
the modified version of xdb_sql -- I already sent you the patch for the 
groups support, and it appears someone already fixed this problem =) 
After applying the changes below, the memory corruption and crash with 
the user profiles went away.  The profiles now update (almost) correctly 
-- the only remaining problem is that the e-mail address won't update.

Not sure why the e-mail isn't being updated - perhaps because JIM (and 
all clients?) send two e-mail addresses in the vcard (a preferred and 
secondary), and that the code in xdb_sql_vcard.c is grabbing the last 
(empty) one?

At any rate, thanks for your help and I hope the patch helps - I also 
hope a new xdb_sql release is made with these fixes, to help the others 
who may have been banging their heads against the wall =)  Oh, and I 
also changed the sample_database.sql script to set username to 64 chars, 
instead of the default 32 (which was too small in my case) -- I can send 
diffs for that as well, if you like.

Thanks again,

-b
