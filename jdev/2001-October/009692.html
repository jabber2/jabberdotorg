<PRE>There were some good responses to the new W3C patent policy. 

The W3C has put out a new reponse

I agree 100% that submarine patents are bad and any attempt to eliminate them will be good. But reading the document I am not very clear if what happens when a company finds that it has a patent relating a royalty free standard. It seems that the company then has to license the patents under RAND terms and NOT royalty free terms.

Please explain.
