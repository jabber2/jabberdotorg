<PRE>While there may be very little &quot;demand&quot; on the part of the programmer's side, it would 
be very nice to know which server this week would allow users to access the transports 
to other services. I would estimate that more than half the time the transports at 
Jabber.org are down (or at least the transports that are of interest to me, Yahoo, AIM 
and ICQ). I realize that some of this is due to incompatibilities between the transports 
and the services (aim and icq) or bugs in the transport (yahoo) but since not everyone is 
running at the same code revision for each of these transports, and some have worked, 
it would be nice to know which servers were acting properly and which are having 
problems.

Perhaps there should be an availability module for the server that can send a message 
to   your web server, or an administratively assigned client, that would validate that the 
transports needed are functioning and report on that. There are a couple of automated 
services out there that would allow you to validate that specific transports are 
functioning. For example there is a baseball player stats service that has hooks into AIM 
and I presume MSN. Possibly ICQ and Yahoo as well. Sending one of these services a 
&quot;menu&quot; IM is suposed to send back a menu of options for that service. However that 
does not confirm presense changes to that service.

At that point I agree that the cost in time and effort to maintain clients for each of the 
services to confirm that pressence changes are being passed back and forth cleanly 
gets out of hand.
