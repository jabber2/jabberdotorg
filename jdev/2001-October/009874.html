<PRE>Hi, all. Another successful Jabber/DotGNU meeting. here's the log:
please send me your requests for dates (thirsday or friday) and times 
(any time) for a regular weekly meeting.


[17:48] &lt;theo&gt; ok, bringing up the Agenda...
[17:51] &lt;theo&gt; first item: inter-process communication.
[17:51] %% ajmitch has joined
[17:51] &lt;theo&gt; i'm quite sure jabber can be used for routing of XML 
around the net,
[17:51] &lt;theo&gt; hi, ajmitch  :)
[17:52] &lt;theo&gt; does anyone from dotgnu have any comments about what 
dotgnu needs?
[17:53] %% allgaier2 has joined
[17:53] &lt;nb&gt; My comment would be that we don't need this urgently at all :-)
[17:53] %% rs has joined
[17:53] &lt;chillywilly&gt; er?
[17:53] &lt;theo&gt; ok, why do you say that?
[17:53] &lt;chillywilly&gt; sure we do
[17:54] &lt;chillywilly&gt; can jabber route SOAP?
[17:54] &lt;nb&gt; The urgent objective is to build a webservices platform 
that is copyleft and that can compete with .NET
[17:54] &lt;theo&gt; nb: you don't think that dotGNU needs XML routing right now?
[17:54] &lt;chillywilly&gt; dude and how do you expect the pieces to talk to 
each other?
[17:54] &lt;nb&gt; Yes, that is an urgent need.
[17:54] &lt;WeAreAllJesse&gt; Err..uhh...what is dotgnu?
[17:54] &lt;theo&gt; chilly: yep, jabber can route SOAP, and XML-RPC, and any 
other text...
[17:54] &lt;theo&gt; Jesse:
[17:55] %% fingolfin has joined
[17:55] &lt;chillywilly&gt; <A HREF="http://dotgnu.org">http://dotgnu.org</A>
[17:55] &lt;theo&gt; sorry, dotGNU is a platform being developed by GNU and 
FreeDevelopers to provide web services, authentication, identity, etc...
[17:55] &lt;theo&gt; in response to Microsoft's .NET project.
[17:55] &lt;fingolfin&gt; the core of Jabber (which used to be called etherx) 
is essentially a XML routing system
[17:55] &lt;chillywilly&gt; <A HREF="http://goats.gnue.org/~chilywilly/gcomm/">http://goats.gnue.org/~chilywilly/gcomm/</A> is 
something I am starting
[17:55] &lt;nb&gt; chillywilly: First we need to need to have pieces running 
that do something useful.
[17:56] &lt;WeAreAllJesse&gt; And I guess that thing that AOL was working on 
to compete with .NET
[17:56] &lt;chillywilly&gt; but dave and I gave it a different name ;)
[17:56] &lt;theo&gt; fin: right. Jabber is all about XML routing.
[17:56] &lt;chillywilly&gt; nb: a distributed object system is needed
[17:56] &lt;nb&gt; And in order to be able to run code remotely, we need a 
secure execution environment and an auth system.
[17:56] &lt;nb&gt; Those are the top priorities.
[17:57] &lt;chillywilly&gt; nb: yea, but I am not gonna be doing either one of 
those right now...
[17:57] &lt;theo&gt; nb: hm... ok, understood. let's move onto that now, 
Authentication.
[17:57] &lt;nb&gt; chillywilly:  I agree about hte need for a distributed 
object system...
[17:57] &lt;theo&gt; too bad Mike Hearn is not here,
[17:57] &lt;theo&gt; he's the local spearheader of authentication.
[17:57] &lt;nb&gt; but that isn't the top priority right now...
[17:58] &lt;theo&gt; mike has worked out a complete auth system,
[17:58] &lt;rs&gt; chillywilly:the link you posted returns a 404
[17:58] %% fingolfin has left
[17:58] &lt;chillywilly&gt; hmmmm
[17:58] &lt;nb&gt; I'd be happy to disucss this with you in some detail at 
another occasion :-)
[17:58] %% fingolfin has joined
[17:58] &lt;theo&gt; that uses tokens. digging up mike's stuff now..
[17:58] &lt;fingolfin&gt; yet another auth system? :)
[17:59] &lt;theo&gt; haha,
[17:59] &lt;nb&gt; I have a list of ten possible auth systems that exist or 
are under development.
[17:59] &lt;theo&gt; over on the jabber lists there have been alot of talk 
about authentication.
[17:59] &lt;theo&gt; we are getting ready to create a auth framework for jabber,
[17:59] &lt;nb&gt; One item on my list is &quot;Jabber auth&quot; ...
[18:00] &lt;nb&gt; I'd really love to learn more about this. :-)
[18:00] &lt;theo&gt; that will provide a basic framework, and allow &quot;modules&quot; 
to be plugged in to do certain types of auth, like Kerberos, or my 
Immier plan, or mike's Ticket plan, etc...
[18:00] &lt;fingolfin&gt; jabber has a nice 0k auth system, and jer just added 
in the last missing piece to it :)
[18:00] &lt;fingolfin&gt; theo: that sounds good
[18:00] &lt;theo&gt; fin: oohh... awesomwe.
[18:00] &lt;fingolfin&gt; theo: one hint, though, try to keep it ... implementable
[18:00] &lt;theo&gt; yes, i agree.
[18:01] &lt;fingolfin&gt; i.e. with jabber we tried to keep it such that 
clients are easy to implement
[18:01] &lt;nb&gt; How much momentun does the Jabber auth project have?
[18:01] &lt;theo&gt; alot now.
[18:01] &lt;fingolfin&gt; I guess I could add 0k auth/registration to 
JabberFoX within a couple of hours (if I had that time...)
[18:01] &lt;theo&gt; and nb:
[18:02] &lt;theo&gt; &quot;Jabber Auth&quot; is turning out to be a framework that 
allows different ways and models of authentication.
[18:02] &lt;theo&gt; so dotGNU could develop a auth system that works best for 
it, and use that within dotGNU,
[18:02] &lt;nb&gt; Do you have a website about it?
[18:02] &lt;theo&gt; while remaining 100% interoperable with other &quot;jabber 
auth&quot; systems.
[18:02] &lt;theo&gt; currently the only info is the webbed logs of the lists,
[18:03] &lt;theo&gt; which i'm bringing up now.
[18:03] &lt;fingolfin&gt; uhm
[18:03] &lt;fingolfin&gt; if you mean websites about jabber's 0k, there are 
plenty, or do you mean the auth architecture in general?
[18:04] &lt;fingolfin&gt; erhm, plenty -&gt; two, one for 0k auth, one for 0k reg :)
[18:04] &lt;theo&gt; some threads:
[18:04] &lt;theo&gt; 
<A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2001-September/008599.html">http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2001-September/008599.html</A>
[18:05] &lt;theo&gt; 
<A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2001-September/008616.html">http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2001-September/008616.html</A>
[18:05] &lt;theo&gt; ah, hell, this entire month archive: 
<A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2001-September/thread.html">http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2001-September/thread.html</A>
[18:05] &lt;theo&gt; and this last month's: 
<A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2001-October/thread.html">http://mailman.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2001-October/thread.html</A>
[18:06] &lt;theo&gt; that is all on general distributed auth system framework 
in jabber
[18:06] &lt;theo&gt; fin: and what about Jabber's auth OK system?
[18:06] &lt;theo&gt; in docs.jabber.org?
[18:06] &lt;nb&gt; Would there be any chance of finding a Jabber person who 
would be interested in porting some of the work that is done in the 
Jabber community to make it available under DotGNU?
[18:07] &lt;theo&gt; you mean code?
[18:07] &lt;theo&gt; yes, quite sure.
[18:07] &lt;theo&gt; i'll ask around for you, if you want,
[18:08] &lt;theo&gt; or you could drum up support by subscribing to the 
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jdev at jabber.org</A> list...
[18:08] &lt;theo&gt; <A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/jdev">http://mailman.jabber.org/jdev</A>
[18:08] &lt;nb&gt; You know, DotGNU auth is really like a horse race...
[18:08] &lt;theo&gt; ack,
[18:08] &lt;theo&gt; <A HREF="http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/jdev">http://mailman.jabber.org/listinfo/jdev</A>
[18:08] &lt;theo&gt; how so?
[18:08] &lt;nb&gt; several auth projects running and we'll see which one runs 
best.
[18:09] &lt;theo&gt; yes, my thoughts, too.
[18:09] &lt;theo&gt; but here's a suggestion:
[18:09] &lt;nb&gt; I think a jabber-based project would have very good chances 
to gain very good momentum.
[18:09] &lt;fingolfin&gt; theo: wait, I can post in two links regarding 0k
[18:09] &lt;theo&gt; heavily work with us on developing this common framework.
[18:09] &lt;theo&gt; if the framework itself comes out to your liking (is very 
flexible and secure enough)
[18:09] %% WeAreAllJesse has left
[18:09] &lt;fingolfin&gt; <A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org/draft-proto/html/zerok.html">http://docs.jabber.org/draft-proto/html/zerok.html</A>
[18:10] &lt;fingolfin&gt; <A HREF="http://core.jabber.org/white/zerokreg.sgml.html">http://core.jabber.org/white/zerokreg.sgml.html</A>
[18:10] &lt;theo&gt; then just take the ideas you had for dotGNU, and turn 
them into &quot;modules&quot; for this jabber auth framework.
[18:10] &lt;theo&gt; then let them conmpete.
[18:10] &lt;nb&gt; In what language are you implementing in, and what license 
are you using?
[18:10] &lt;chillywilly&gt; is this a good doc t start reading to learn jabber?
[18:10] &lt;theo&gt; this would be better, IMO, b/c it would ensure 
interoperability between all of them,
[18:10] &lt;chillywilly&gt; the have their own license
[18:10] &lt;chillywilly&gt; JOSL
[18:10] &lt;fingolfin&gt; w/o being involved into dotgnu, I think dotGNU could 
profit from the existing Jabber implementations &amp; work already done; and 
Jabber could profit from dotGNU on the long run, too
[18:11] &lt;nb&gt; Even is the short run...
[18:11] &lt;fingolfin&gt; JOSL is similiar to the Mozilla license
[18:11] %% allgaier2 has left
[18:11] %% dirkx-mac has left
[18:11] &lt;theo&gt; implimentations: there is the Jabber Open Source Server, 
covered by the JOSL and written in C.
[18:11] &lt;fingolfin&gt; chillywilly: the two docs I posted are probably not 
goot to start learning jabber :)
[18:11] &lt;theo&gt; there is also a Java server starting up,
[18:11] &lt;nb&gt; Foir example there will be a conference the the cyberspace 
policy institute at George Washington University early next year...
[18:11] &lt;rs&gt; chillywilly:<A HREF="http://docs.jabber.org">http://docs.jabber.org</A>
[18:11] &lt;theo&gt; and a Python server.
[18:12] &lt;theo&gt; i don't know about their licensing, though.
[18:12] &lt;chillywilly&gt; nb: another one?
[18:12] &lt;fingolfin&gt; nb: I don't think so, unless dotGNU manages to do a 
lot on the shortrun, and then it would be the first project of this kind 
to do so :) but maybe mid run? :)
[18:12] &lt;theo&gt; and i have [plans for a Perl implimentation written in 
Kuhn's Artistic License 2.0
[18:12] &lt;nb&gt; Yes, another one specifically about auth and virtual ID.
[18:12] &lt;chillywilly&gt; no copyleft?
[18:13] &lt;nb&gt; The important people in Washington are very interested in 
that kind of thing now.
[18:13] &lt;theo&gt; chilly: i don't know. the Jabber Open Source Server is 
not copyleft, no, but the others might.
[18:13] &lt;nb&gt; For DotGNU copyleft is very important.
[18:13] &lt;theo&gt; [18:12] &lt;dyfet&gt; Since even the Mozilla project eventually 
was forced to consider this, would this end up being dual licensed?
[18:14] &lt;theo&gt; i don't think the JOSS will be open sourced,
[18:14] &lt;nb&gt; In fact anything other than GPL is likely to be a major 
obstacle.
[18:14] &lt;theo&gt; but i do think there will be both the Jabber Open Source 
Server in the JOSL, and a GNU Jabber server(s) in the GPL,
[18:14] &lt;theo&gt; each would take different approaches to doing Jabber, i 
think,
[18:15] &lt;chillywilly&gt; hey this standard is open so you could implement 
it any way you like
[18:15] &lt;chillywilly&gt; with whatever license you like
[18:15] &lt;theo&gt; and i'm sure there will be programmers working on the 
JOSS now that will give their code to the GNU implimentation,
[18:15] &lt;theo&gt; chilly: yep, exactly.
[18:16] &lt;theo&gt; the specs are open. anyone can impliment under any license.
[18:16] &lt;chillywilly&gt; it is nice to have GPL'd jabber stuff though...for 
dotgnu anyway
[18:16] &lt;theo&gt; yep, and it will happen, i'm sure.
[18:16] &lt;theo&gt; there are already GPL'ed clients...
[18:16] &lt;theo&gt; quite a few, in fact.
[18:16] &lt;theo&gt; so, licensing won't be an issue, i think.
[18:17] &lt;theo&gt; jabber is 100% open, so implimentations can be any license.
[18:17] &lt;theo&gt; and there will be quite a number of coders that will give 
their current JOSL code to GPL, i'm sure.
[18:18] &lt;nb&gt; So the main issue would be to find project leaders who are 
knowledgeable abou the Jabber stuff, and well-connected in the Jabber 
community?
[18:18] &lt;theo&gt; so, next business: authorization and access control.
[18:18] &lt;theo&gt; nb: yep, although jabber is simple enough that you could 
just use the docs as a ref to build an implimentation.
[18:18] &lt;theo&gt; the protocol docs are self-explanitory.
[18:19] &lt;theo&gt; it's just a matter of deciding what tools to use to build 
the server, and what &quot;tactics&quot; to take in programming it.
[18:19] &lt;theo&gt; i'm sure the vast collective experience of the GNU 
community can produce some excellent implimentations.
[18:19] &lt;chillywilly&gt; what do we gain by using jabber as the messagin 
backend?
[18:19] &lt;theo&gt; using all GNU tools.
[18:19] &lt;nb&gt; In many areas of programming, experience is extremely 
important.
[18:20] &lt;theo&gt; for one: Jabber already exists. it is flexible, fast, and 
moderatley secure (we are working to make that *very* secure now)
[18:20] &lt;fingolfin&gt; chillywilly: a well-thought, tested and established 
enginge?
[18:20] &lt;nb&gt; I mean specific experience... I wouldn't want to bet on a 
team that is not led by a person who has specific experience related to 
jabber.
[18:21] &lt;theo&gt; so authorization: jabber is also working on a access 
control/permissions system.
[18:21] &lt;theo&gt; it is part of the &quot;Jabber Profiles&quot; work, run by me and 
Mike Hearn.
[18:21] &lt;nb&gt; How secure is your &quot;*very* secure&quot;?  Comparable to GnuPG?
[18:21] &lt;theo&gt; nb: ah, ok. gotcha. i for one am willing to help dotgnu 
programmers understand Jabber.
[18:21] &lt;theo&gt; nb: hopefully more secure.
[18:22] &lt;chillywilly&gt; thing is no mattter what someone is going to have 
to learn the jabber system
[18:22] &lt;theo&gt; nb: one of the goals of Heg (here in the room) is to 
tuirn Jabber into a real-time e-commerce b2b platform,
[18:22] &lt;theo&gt; to do large and very sensitive financial transactions and 
verifications.
[18:22] &lt;nb&gt; That's good to hear.
[18:23] &lt;theo&gt; he wants it to be the infrastructure of the banking 
industru for the 21st centrury.
[18:23] &lt;theo&gt; yes, so i'm confident that with enough man power, 
jabber's security will only be a matter of &quot;how secure you want it?&quot;
[18:24] &lt;nb&gt; I think having a DotGNU port of his stuff would be a wise 
marketing move for him in that case.
[18:24] &lt;theo&gt; yep, i'm sure it would.
[18:25] &lt;nb&gt; You know I talked with the chairman of an industry 
consortium today...
[18:25] &lt;theo&gt; authorization: Jabber Profiles covers access control and 
Permissions: <A HREF="http://www.theoretic.com/profiles">http://www.theoretic.com/profiles</A>
[18:25] &lt;nb&gt; he told me how the credit card companies don't want to pay 
a &quot;Microsoft tax&quot;...
[18:25] &lt;theo&gt; hm..... very interesting... very good.
[18:26] &lt;nb&gt; but each copany is currently most interested in developing 
their own stuff and then pushing it as a standard.
[18:26] &lt;theo&gt; i'm going to be attending the &quot;Open Source in Banking and 
Finance&quot; conference in early november.
[18:26] &lt;theo&gt; hope to make lots of contacts there.
[18:26] &lt;nb&gt; It's *not* going to be easy for us to break into that kind 
of market.
[18:26] &lt;theo&gt; next on the list: registration/subscription infrastructure.
[18:26] %% rs has left
[18:27] &lt;theo&gt; nb: i agree. but it can be done with smart marketing and 
packaging.
[18:27] &lt;theo&gt; registration:
[18:27] &lt;theo&gt; nb, what do you think of jabber providing the 
infrastructure for registration and subscription to servives for dotgnu?
[18:28] &lt;nb&gt; Really the only way to build credibility is via conference 
in mainstream venues such as CPI.
[18:29] &lt;nb&gt; Theo: what exactly do you mean with &quot;registration and 
subscription&quot;?
[18:29] &lt;theo&gt; hm...
[18:29] &lt;theo&gt; in jabber, this sort of thing will be very flexible,
[18:29] %% fingolfin has left
[18:29] &lt;nb&gt; I think people will expect to sign up to all kinds of 
services via forms on websites...
[18:29] &lt;theo&gt; a Pub/Sub working group was just created to discuss this 
sort of thing, but...
[18:30] &lt;nb&gt; that's what webmasters and customers are used to today.
[18:30] &lt;theo&gt; i mean registrations as in becomming a &quot;dotgnu member&quot;. 
getting an account, etc...
[18:30] &lt;theo&gt; and subscriptions as in signing up to get stock quotes, 
or calendaring services, etc.
[18:31] &lt;theo&gt; both of which could be managed as the userb wants, likely 
from a central &quot;location&quot; (like their home computer)
[18:31] %% chillywilly has left
[18:31] &lt;nb&gt; If you want to push any other solution (different from HTML 
forms) that's going to be a tough sell I think.
[18:31] %% chillywilly has joined
[18:31] &lt;theo&gt; possibly.
[18:31] &lt;theo&gt; and this will lead into jabber and dotgnu's solutions to 
'winforms'.
[18:32] &lt;nb&gt; What are &quot;winforms&quot; ?
[18:32] &lt;theo&gt; i think they are microsoft's &quot;solution&quot; to merging the 
web with the desktop.... in a UI perspective.
[18:33] &lt;theo&gt; a common &quot;spec&quot; that can be used to create forms on a 
website or a local application, also create websites that look and act 
like a desktop app.
[18:33] &lt;theo&gt; basically universal, &quot;cross platform&quot; form mark up.
[18:34] &lt;theo&gt; [18:33] &lt;dyfet&gt; in other words new form tags for windows 
ui elements?
[18:34] &lt;theo&gt; dyfet: yep, exactly.
[18:34] &lt;theo&gt; i guess i should start wrapping this meeting up,
[18:34] &lt;chillywilly&gt; i was reading about how they xml would lead to a 
standardized UI markup language
[18:35] &lt;theo&gt; and saving the rest for next week (which should hopefully 
go off smoother  :-)
[18:35] &lt;theo&gt; yes,
[18:35] &lt;chillywilly&gt; ya, maybe dave can say something in here
[18:35] &lt;chillywilly&gt; :P
[18:35] &lt;theo&gt; there are a number of alternatives:
[18:35] &lt;theo&gt; XUL, wxWindows, XForms, etc...
[18:36] &lt;theo&gt; [18:35] &lt;dyfet&gt; figures...i will have to see how that 
works its way thru w3c!
[18:35] &lt;dyfet&gt; lol
[18:36] &lt;theo&gt; ok, i think this will be a wrap.
[18:36] &lt;theo&gt; it gives us alot to chew about,
[18:36] &lt;theo&gt; and i think the most important thing from this meeting 
was the talk about licensing and implimentations.
[18:37] &lt;chillywilly&gt; time to hack!
[18:37] &lt;chillywilly&gt; for those of us who have no lives

[18:38] &lt;nb&gt; Theo, can you put David and me in touch with the key people 
in the auth and ecommerce-related Jabber projects?
[18:38] &lt;theo&gt; so, any last comments? i'll be posting this archive to 
the web, to both jabber and dotgnu lists...
[18:38] %% chillywilly has left
[18:38] &lt;theo&gt; nb: no prob.
[18:38] &lt;theo&gt; i'll get you hooked up over the next 2 days.
[18:38] &lt;nb&gt; Sounds great... thanks!
[18:38] &lt;theo&gt; &lt;dyfet&gt; Actually this was informative, even with this 
annoying problem.  We absolutely should talk more.
[18:39] %% allgaier2 has left
[18:39] &lt;theo&gt; dyfet: i agree...
[18:39] &lt;theo&gt; i will make this a regular, weekly thing.
[18:39] &lt;theo&gt; is Friday or Thursday best for everyone here?
[18:39] &lt;theo&gt; and what about time? like now or earlier?
[18:40] &lt;theo&gt; [18:39] &lt;dyfet&gt; And I will fix my client if its at my end...
[18:40] &lt;theo&gt; dyfet: i'll help you,
[18:40] &lt;nb&gt; If it's Friday, then I'd request that it shouldn't be earlier.
[18:40] %% chillywilly has joined
[18:41] &lt;theo&gt; ok,
[18:41] &lt;nb&gt; On Thursdays essentially any time can be arranged, in most 
weeks.
