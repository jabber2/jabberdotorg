Hi, well it all sounds really exciting, and welcome to the Jabber
community! Basically, carrying your data in an extension qualified
by a separate namespace (or namespaces) is exactly the right thing
to do.

I'll attempt to answer some of the questions..

&gt;<i> - If you were tasked with making jabber perform the tasks that I've
</I>&gt;<i> loosely outlined, how would you do it?  
</I>
The same way - define an extension by means of a new namespace, and
define what the contents of that extension shoudl look like. *What*
namespace, is a different question (and a bit of a sidetrack) - the
ones beginning jabber: are reserved; but it's certainly possible to
form an 'interest group' to crystallize an 'official' extension - 
see the info on JIGs and JEPs on <A HREF="http://foundation.jabber.org.">http://foundation.jabber.org.</A>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Exactly what needs to be added to jabberd server to handle the addition
</I>&gt;<i> of jabber:x:cluster and jabber:x:cluster:alarm?
</I>
Absolutely nothing. The Jabber server will willingly shunt your custom
(well-defined) XML data here and there. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - It would appear that jabber seems to have an extensibility crisis;
</I>&gt;<i> people say that it is possible; the extensibility I need seems to be in 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber, but there's A LOT that one needs to wade through in order to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out how this might be accomplished.
</I>
Well, if you're happy reading Perl, you could look at an implementation
of Jabber-RPC - this is similar to what you want to do - transport
custom data (in this case, XML-RPC payloads) over Jabber. There's always
a decision to be made on what core element you transmit your data with;
you use the &lt;message&gt; example above, which is perfectly fine; 
Jabber-RPC uses the &lt;iq&gt; element as it's more of a request/response kind
of thing. 

Go for it - it's actually very straight forward, and you've come to 
the right place for help.

&gt;<i> - I intend to transmit anywhere from 12MB to 50MB of data an hour, to
</I>&gt;<i> multiple jabber clients, at intervals as quick as every second;
</I>&gt;<i> effectively creating a contiguous stream of data, does jabberd v1.4.X
</I>&gt;<i> allow for such excessive data transmition?  Or will I hit throttling
</I>&gt;<i> heuristics that have been put in place in jabberd?  
</I>
These throttling mechanisms are tweakable, so it's pretty much down
to you.

&gt;<i> - I want the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">data at cluster</A> client to essentially &quot;push&quot; the cluster xml to
</I>&gt;<i> all subscribed clients that have the required subscription presence (I
</I>&gt;<i> think? =) What is the best way to do this?  Start a &lt;stream&gt; and close it
</I>&gt;<i> only when the jabber client exits?
</I>
Well, the two things are pretty mutual anyway ;-) On pub/sub there's
some recent movements - check out the news on <A HREF="http://dev.jabber.org">http://dev.jabber.org</A>

I'll stop there, mostly cos I have to go, but also to give others
the chance to contribute ;-)

hope that helps for a starter-answer
