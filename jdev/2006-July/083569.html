</I>Well, I strongly suspect that immediately after displaying a 
&quot;banner&quot;, the client would continue authenticating, so I'm unsure of 
the actual value in working the protocol such that the text is sent 
prior to authentication. SSH, FTP, etc clients have this behaviour.

Basically, the client would continue the authentication 
automatically, where possible, and as I understand Jefferson's 
requirements, that would be taken to mean acceptance, which it quite 
obviously isn't.

SASL authentication is designed as a one-way gate - once 
authenticating, trying to authenticate again is an error. This isn't 
an XMPP thing, it's a SASL thing. In theory, the server might have 
dropped permissions needed to handle authentication by then.

There is, however, facility to send a message indicating that the 
terms and conditions have changed (or reminding the newly connected 
user where to find them, or even listing them), by sending a message 
stanza from the server. This works with all clients, and although 
it's post-authentication, the acceptance of these terms could be 
deduced from the first attempt to send a message.

Dave.
