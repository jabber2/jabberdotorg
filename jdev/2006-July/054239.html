Indeed I think the RFC is pretty much on target in its SSL/TLS
specification. My criticism above is that clients have failed to follow
the RFC.

There are in fact many servers using self-signed certificates but that
accomplishes very little when clients don't even bother to warn users
about bad certificate chains. In a way, the current focus on getting
server certificates signed by a CA is a red herring; it doesn't matter
so much if they're self-signed AS LONG AS the client WARNS the user that
the cert can't be verified. After all, the user can import a self-signed
certificate into his or her local trust database at first use and at
least be alerted when the certificate CHANGES, indicating an attack
either now or at the time of import. This is not an uncommon
protocol--just look at SSH host key handling.

I do have a concern about the RFC, in the details of cn matching
performed when SRV records are involved. While clearly you do the right
thing in ignoring the hostname returned in an SRV record for purposes of
cn matching, the defined approach imposes a problematic constraint on
servers: if I want to offer a certificate for users @example.com, I must
use a certificate for &quot;example.com&quot;. Because the cn of this certificate
is the domain root, if stolen it could be used to spoof other services
for the domain root itself. Meanwhile, since jabber servers are a new
breed, there remains a great deal of unaudited server code. The prospect
of having a certificate for my domain root running in an unaudited piece
of server software exposed to the world is one I do not relish.

An alternative might have been to match the cn against the same name
used in the successful SRV query (the query, not the result). So if for
example the successful SRV query was for _xmpp-server._tcp.example.com,
the certificate cn could have that same name, in addition to
example.com. This would allow use of server certs that don't have as
much value to an attacker if compromised.

I'm not certain exactly what the best approach would be, but the status
quo is not ideal in my view.
