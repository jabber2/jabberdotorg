</I>&gt;<i> The question is not whether certain organizations need this, the
</I>&gt;<i> question is how to best do this in XMPP. IMHO we have two alternatives:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A new, optional attribute in the stream header. This informs the
</I>&gt;<i> receiving party of the service policy but does not require the receiving
</I>&gt;<i> party to affirm that they accept the service policy. Plus the client may
</I>&gt;<i> not understand the new attribute and thus ignore it. Therefore the
</I>&gt;<i> server would never know if the policy has been shown to a user, let
</I>&gt;<i> alone whether the user agrees to abide by the policy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. A new stream feature. This would involve a request-response model,
</I>&gt;<i> wherein the server sends the current policy to the client and the client
</I>&gt;<i> MUST show the policy to the human user (if any) and the client MUST
</I>&gt;<i> return some kind of ack to the server (yes, I showed it to the human and
</I>&gt;<i> the human agreed to abide by the policy). The server could make receipt
</I>&gt;<i> of the ACK necessary in order to proceed (a la &lt;required/&gt; for TLS) and
</I>&gt;<i> provide only the service banner in the initial stream feature set. Thus
</I>&gt;<i> the server could know that a user has seen and agrees to the policy
</I>&gt;<i> before allowing the client to proceed with TLS and SASL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second option seems preferable to me, especially since it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> require any changes to RFC 3920 (we can define stream features to our
</I>&gt;<i> heart's content, e.g. in a JEP). Naturally this is all XMPP 1.0 stuff,
</I>&gt;<i> older (&quot;XMPP 0.9&quot;) clients might not be able to connect depending on how
</I>&gt;<i> much the service admins have locked things down. But I take it that is
</I>&gt;<i> the point.
