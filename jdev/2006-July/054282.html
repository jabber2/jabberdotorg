Let me expand on the reasons for my first reply (which re-reading I
see it looks a bit antagonistic which I didn't intend).

I don't see this as an oversight necessarily.  You are comparing
apples and oranges when you bring SSH and such back into the
discussion.  I looked--nowhere in the SSH RFC does it mention login
banners.  I don't think it should be in the XMPP RFC either.

Is what you are asking a valid concern and a good idea?  Yes, I agree
there.  What I don't want to see is putting any new requirements on
the clients if that can be avoided.  Putting it on servers is a better
idea.  I'll leave the question of whether this is technically possible
to the rest of you guys.

Is an SASL anonymous connection sufficient for the client to be able
to receive an arbitrary XML stream?  Would a client be expcted to
display messages during this?  Can one login &quot;trigger&quot; another?  Those
are the sorts of things going around in my head, but again, I'm not
pretending to know the answers on this part of the discussion.
