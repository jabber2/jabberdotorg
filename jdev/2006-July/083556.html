<PRE>At Coversant we have testing software we use with SoapBox Server that
could pretty easily be adapted (with something like a SoC project) to
work with any server. Remind me and I'll show it off to the guys at the
interop event.

Included in our automated testing suite are things like which JEP and
section a certain piece of code is testing, what features a server needs
to support in order for the test to work, etc. At this point it's all
internal, but we've talked about contributing it as a basis for an
official JSF test suite. Of course, it's C#, but does run in both Mono
and MS.NET frameworks on Linux or Windows.

As different server implementations show different behaviour, it is
useful to test them, too.

I proposed writing a test software for this year's SoC[0] but
unfortunately no student picked it.

Is there testing software already? Possibly extensible?
