<PRE>Hi,

Some time ago I read in some news that XviD community is going to establish
certification of products which are XviD compatible. Those which are, are
allowed to print a logo on the product. For players which can play DivX
encoded movies, there are DivX logos. Does the JSF plan something like this
for XMPP. In the last time I saw a lot XMPP incompatible clients. Most even
don't do string prepping. So you see some kind of empty nicknames in multi
user conferences and so on. Maybe a kind of logo for XMPP compatible
software and hardware would be nice because it's so easy to claim that
software is XMPP compatible.

best regards
Tobias Markmann
