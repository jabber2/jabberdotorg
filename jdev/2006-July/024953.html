I'm aware that XMPP has history; I still, however, consider a 2000 1.0
release new. And my strong impression is that there has been very little
investigation of security vulnerabilities in XMPP implementations, which
is the principle concern. Newness is not the whole story--just look at
Sendmail for an example of a program that is about as old as anything in
current use, yet another significant vulnerability was disclosed within
recent months. Contrast, for example, the audit history of any of the
popular jabber servers with that of, say, Apache. Not only are there
typically many, many more eyes on Apache, Apache has also been the
subject of a great deal of rigorous auditing. So I agree that &quot;new&quot; is a
subjective characterization, but I hope you see my point.

&gt;<i> A completely different question comes to my mind when you talk about the
</I>&gt;<i> certificate: Even if your certificate for the CN example.com would be
</I>&gt;<i> stolen, what exactly is your connection to other services here? Each
</I>&gt;<i> service could imo use a different certificate - if you want that. And
</I>&gt;<i> all your clients should notice a change of a certificate anyway?
</I>
If the private key for a valid certificate for example.com is stolen, an
attacker can use it to spoof any service for example.com. It doesn't
matter if you use different certificates for other services. The only
thing encoded in the certificate cn is the domain name. (There are usage
constraints on certificates that may differentiate SSL server
certificates from personal client certificates, for example, but nothing
that specifies valid services.) In fact, if you do buy different
certificates for different services, you're just throwing money away--a
certificate for example.com is valid for any service found at that address.
