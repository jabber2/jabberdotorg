Well, my understanding of your requirements is that you (may) need to
know if the end user has seen the banner and agreed to its terms before
allowing the user to authenticate. If so, (2) is the only way to go. If
your requirements are more lax, (1) might be acceptable (although I
really don't like anything that requires changes to RFC 3920).

In any case, working on this is not especially a high priority for me,
but if you'd like to collaborate, contact me off-list.
