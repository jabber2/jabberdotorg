I don't know where you're going with this. XMPP is a remotely accessible
service. I need to reliably advise potential users about service
policies (including monitoring and applicable law) before they use the
system. I don't have control over what banners remote users see when
they log in to their local domains (presuming that they're even using
Windows), so I don't see how that is in the least relevant.

&gt;<i> Usually you'll see these banners at the point of entry as it were.  On

</I>&gt;<i> it seems a bit superfluous.
</I>
Accessing an XMPP service /is/ a remote server login.

Bannering is a pretty commonplace feature of modern network services.

Sorry, but you're off track.
