We have clients that support other admin functionality as well. Even 
features like setting a message of the day, that is not even standardized.
Some clients separate the essential settings from expert-settings. The 
authorization identity could be one of these expert-settings.

Also I don't think, that this feature is admin-only. This was only an 
example I gave. Let me give another example: There could be an account 
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">sales at example.com</A> where all people of the sales departement of example 
corp. will be allowed to authorize as. So that customers can send a 
Jabber message to this address and will get a response from one of the 
example corp. sales people.
Having individual authentication identities for these people will allow 
to delete someones access to this JID when he changes the departement or 
leaves the company without the need, that the other people having access 
to this JID have to reconfigure anything (setting a new password).
