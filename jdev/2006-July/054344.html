<PRE>Hi all,

First, I'm a jabber newbie.  I've also got a question about resource usage
within the
jabber protocol.  I'm interested in the idea of using resources, or
something like it,
in ways I've not seen before.

As a first example, it seems like it might be nice to have one JID have
sortof virtual
modes of interaction, such as &quot;work&quot;, &quot;home&quot;, &quot;some-hobby&quot;, each of which
would have
it's own roster.  I'm aware of the jep on privacy-lists, but this seems a
little complex
(maybe because it doesn't allow changing rosters).

As a second example, it seems like it might be nice to  use the whole
resource
part of the JID as a reference to a directory space dedicated to the user,
maybe even
with &quot;executable programs&quot; in the sense of jabber-aware programs.

Since I'm a jabber newbie, I expect that I'll likely get responses along the
lines of
&quot;see pub-sub&quot; for example 2.  Such responses are heartily welcome.  I'm also
interested
to know if there have been any previous efforts to use the resource part of
a JID as
its own namespace, and if so, what happened to them?

Best,

-- 
scott
