You're right, I do always look at this from a network
administrator viewpoint or at least I try to.

What I'm getting at here is division of labour. I don't
think that an XMPP client should be expected to know how to
use HTTP tunneling to get through a firewall to speak to an
XMPP server listening on a particular IP on the other side.
I don't think it should be the responsibility of every XMPP
client/library to provide this functionality. However, I do
believe there is a case to be made for saying the client
should be able to talk to an XMPP proxy that will do the
tunneling for them.  There is nothing to stop a user from
running a XMPP proxy that knows how to tunnel via HTTP
on their own box on a port above 1024 (and perhaps below
on windows - I don't know).

It's simply the UNIX philosophy - keep tools small, cohesive
and with a capability of using one another.
