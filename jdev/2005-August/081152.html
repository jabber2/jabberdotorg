s2s is not easy and there are very few people who understand it 
completely. It would be good to gather implementation experience from 
them. I think at this point we need to understand and document the 
protocols we have now rather than develop new protocols.

I see no reason for a separate working group yet. We should be able to 
have an intelligent discussion on this list. Feel free to start a new 
thread about it so we can start defining the threat model etc.

&gt;<i> We also should invite the google developers to our discussions. It would

No invitation is needed. This is an open list, as are all of our lists. 
If they want to participate, they are free to do so. In fact they've 
probably been lurking on the lists for months, wouldn't you think?
