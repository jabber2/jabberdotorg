I understand that it is easy, I've already made the modifications to my
library to accomodate it, I just don't want to make those modifications
permanent because they are unnecessary cruft. If the spec is followed
then there is only a need to accomodate the following information from
the user/automated client: (i) their JID; (ii) their password or other
authentication token. As far as I'm concerned this is nice, clean and
the way things should be.

If you permit the user to provide you with a server name and port number
then things become more complicated than they need to be. For instance,
does the user-supplied server name qualify as a valid identity for the
purpose of validating the server's X590 certificate. Or, if there this
is an automated client, should we fall back to checking for DNS SRV
records if there is no server listening at the specified server address?
Do we offer the user configuration options to answer these questions and
the others that arise? ...

I guess I find that the RFC3920 is flexible and complex enough that I
don't wish to see additional de-facto standards materialise that need to
be supported.
