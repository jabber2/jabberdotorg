Sure, if it is an email address, it would only make sense to use
the appropriate scheme prefix.

I made that example especially misleading and exaggerated as I was
only asking about the _potential_ confusion over the similarity.
Of course I was speaking of web pages, where it is a snap to give
email addresses correctly as useable links, which holds true as
well for jabber then (xmpp: if it's registered somewhen,
<A HREF="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes">http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes</A>).

What I was onto is the usage of purely informational identifiers,
namely &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">username at forum.de.selfhtml.org</A>&quot; (real domain) and their
potential confusion to HUMANS (not the clients) - if not explicitely
turned into an appropriate html link tag (because there exists no
senseful protocol). It's still troublesome if you give @email and
@jabber addresses as correctly protocol prefixed links but have a
couple of textual <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">xxx at yyy</A> still elsewhere in a web page (people
on occasion overlook links, and thereby copy&amp;paste the wrong info).

Ralph Meijer already answered the question I was onto - such user
confusion exists (even for pages which clearly state the situation),
it's just not measurable in hard numbers or such.
