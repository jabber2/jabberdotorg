<PRE>	Hi,

	We are planning to deploy a Jabber server in the enterprise
&quot;extranet&quot; and to move customer support communication to it. However we
have quite complex multilayered hierarchy of customers with strong
visibility/isolation rules like below :

Layers, from top to bottom :

1. Technical support (TS), inside enterprise;
2. Customer support (CS), inside enterprise;
3. System owners (SO), outside enterprise;
4. End users (EU), outside enterprise.

Rules for these layers :

1,2. Inside enterprise, TS and CS people can freely speak
	with each other and between teams. As well as with
	SO and EU people when they need appropriate support.

3. SO people can speak to CS people;
	then CS people can possibly connect them to TS people.
	SO entities (groups of 1 or more persons) are not allowed
	to know and to speak with other SO entities in their layer.
	Inside SO entity, people are allowed to speak with each other.

4. EU people can speak to SO people. SO people can connect them
	to CS people, and they then - to TS. Each SO entity
	has 1 or more subordinated EU people.
	EU people are not allowed to know and speak with each other.

	So as you see, these rules are quite advanced. Now I would like
to ask your advise on how to implement them in Jabber setup.
What documentation should I read, and additinal modules
or even server implementations should we use ?

Thank you in advance for your replies.
