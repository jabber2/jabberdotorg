Well strictly speaking, I suppose that the case of not having to probe still 
exists if another of your own resources is already online, because all the 
state for your contacts would be present in the server already due to being 
probed earlier for the other resource.  State of other users' contacts might 
also be present in the server and not need to be probed.

The way I see it, the act of not probing is an optimisation.  Even for local 
users you might need to probe (suppose your server is distributed somehow, 
and that the two users are on different nodes), and if you don't, then it 
seems like you're just supposed to &quot;pretend&quot; you did.  I thought that was 
clear enoughm though, since all the servers already do it the same way 
without being told to.

But maybe the spec does need updating to clarify that, in which case the XMPP 
list is definitely the place to do that kind of stuff.

&gt;<i> &gt; This much is plain commonsense.  If your contact's server doesn't even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know you're online, it can't know you're there to send the presence to,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let alone know when to send it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I was reffering to earlier, what if the contacts are local to the
</I>&gt;<i> server - the server knows that both contact and user are online.
</I>
It doesn't actually, if you haven't said you're present yet.  You might be a 
bot which has authenticated and is going to do some stuff without actually 
going &quot;online.&quot;  In IM speak, &quot;online&quot; and &quot;present&quot; mean the same thing.  No 
presence, no online.
