CAcert is a network of trust, but trust of identity.  I might be 100% certain
that a spammer is who they say they are -- hell, I might have 
personally signed
their key -- but it doesn't mean that they're instantly a good person.

A network of trust *in general* would work, but it would need to be another
layer over some other network.

One possibility to open things up a little without going all out is to allow
access to every server on the public server list.  I know though, that this
isn't going to satisfy people on vanity domains because they'll still have to
argue for Google to include them on a case-by-case basis.

I'm sure Google will go somewhere with this.  They already accept SMTP from
everywhere and filter spam on that.  My guess is that their plan is to accept
XMPP from everywhere and filter spam on that too.  Somehow.  They have 
a lot of
smart people working there. :-)
