Correct.

&gt;<i> The way I see it, the act of not probing is an optimisation.  Even for local

</I>&gt;<i> and that the two users are on different nodes), and if you don't, then it
</I>&gt;<i> seems like you're just supposed to &quot;pretend&quot; you did.  I thought that was
</I>&gt;<i> clear enoughm though, since all the servers already do it the same way
</I>&gt;<i> without being told to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But maybe the spec does need updating to clarify that, in which case the XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> list is definitely the place to do that kind of stuff.
</I>
Of course common sense and prior experience with IM tech had already
given these answers, but I admit my mistake - I should have requested
some clarification for the sake of completeness on the xmpp list. 
I'll take this there.  Thanks for your patience and willingness to
rfc-speek.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This much is plain commonsense.  If your contact's server doesn't even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; know you're online, it can't know you're there to send the presence to,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; let alone know when to send it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I was reffering to earlier, what if the contacts are local to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server - the server knows that both contact and user are online.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't actually, if you haven't said you're present yet.  You might be a
</I>&gt;<i> bot which has authenticated and is going to do some stuff without actually
</I>&gt;<i> going &quot;online.&quot;  In IM speak, &quot;online&quot; and &quot;present&quot; mean the same thing.  No
</I>&gt;<i> presence, no online.
</I>
Agreed.

Regards,
Vinod.
