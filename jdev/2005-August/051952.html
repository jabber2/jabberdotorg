I don't think it's my server or my client that does this -- it's me. Who 
better to figure out if the other person is human than me? I don't think 
that automated bot-detection methods (client-based or server-based) are 
nearly as effective as human-to-human communication.

&gt;<i> My server should remember which users have passed my anti-SPIM test *and
</I>&gt;<i> which users I have sent stanzas to*. In future those users could send me
</I>&gt;<i> messages or subscription requests (unless I blacklisted them with
</I>&gt;<i> Privacy lists of course).
</I>
Well, my client could simply update my privacy lists once I click the 
big &quot;allow communications with this person until further notice&quot; button.

&gt;<i> [RFC 3921 Privacy lists aren't really designed to block presence stanzas
</I>&gt;<i> that are subscription requests (and allow all other presence stanzas
</I>&gt;<i> through). It should still work though. If it can't be made to work then
</I>&gt;<i> the client might have to produce the Bot-Proof Challenge itself when it
</I>&gt;<i> receives a subscription request.]
</I>
RFC 3921 enables you to block all communication from another JID, so 
your first sentence is not accurate.

&gt;&gt;<i>6. Ask people in my roster whether they know this person
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(could be automated)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes we do need a protocol for this. Of course it fits perfectly with the
</I>&gt;<i> public key association techniques we've been discussing.
</I>
Sure thing, we've talked about that before on one of these lists. I'll 
work on a proto-JEP for that soon.
