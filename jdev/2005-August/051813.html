</I>Currently you can't but rumors are that they will enable this. But I'm 
not too sure of that anymore. Just spotted this 
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/talk/developer.html#service_4">http://www.google.com/talk/developer.html#service_4</A>

&quot;We look forward to federating with any service provider who shares our 
belief in enabling user choice and open communications. We do believe, 
however, that it is important to balance openness with ensuring that we 
maintain a safe and reliable service that protects user privacy and 
blocks spam and other abuses.&quot;

They seem to be very afraid of SPAM on their network which could be the 
main reason why S2S is disabled at the moment :\ They might enable S2S 
on a domain by domain basis, so you'll first have to contact Google and 
sign something before you can talk with @gmail.com people over XMPP.

IMO that would be very BAD, maybe we should even consider blocking 
talk.google.com by default in the XMPP clients if they try to do 
something like that. If they really keep their network closed Bad Things 
are going to happen to XMPP/Jabber IMHO.

BTW I have some Gmail invites available, of course I can invite you if 
you want to play with Google Talk.
