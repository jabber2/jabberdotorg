i totally agree with Tijl.
There are still s2s problems on the current servers. We should figure 
out this problems and work on the s2s protocols for one secure standard. 
When you read this list then you will see lots of developers having 
problems with lots of different s2s implementations we have.

And we should start building a SPIM working group. When XMPP gets more 
popular (and it will now with google), then XMPP will be also attractive 
for Spammers. We must work on a solution now, and not when we get the 
SPIM and it's too late.

We also should invite the google developers to our discussions. It would 
be very interesting for all of us to get feedback and details about 
their server implementation and clustering technologies .
