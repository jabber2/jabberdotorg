<PRE>Hi all,

I'm about to develop a commercial application that makes heavy use of
Jabber. The way we have it all worked out at the moment would require
the clients to properly support thread IDs. I understand what they are
for (keep different conversations separate) but I gather that extremely
few (if any?) clients actually support them properly. I've only tried
Gaim, which doesn't seem to support them at all and Jabberwocky
(for the Amiga!!) which allows you to give a thread ID when starting a
new conversation but then promptly forgets about it afterwards.

I'm quite enthusiastic about this project and would like it to work
with a variety of clients if possible though if it only works with one,
it's not the end of the world. But what do you think the feasibility of
me writing patches for some of the popular open source clients is? Am I
embarking on mission impossible? Would the project leaders even accept
the patches? I can imagine that some of them might want the potential
confusion that threads could create kept out of their clients but it
could be made an optional thing.

Chewi
