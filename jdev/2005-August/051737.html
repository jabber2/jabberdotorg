Thanks for your responses.

What I want shouldn't complicate things too much. I do need the client
to be able to handle multiple chat windows with the same person but it
is not necessary for the client to be able to create additional threads
itself since these chats will actually started by a bot rather than a
user running a GUI client.

I started hacking away at Gaim today. I'm guessing that as clients go,
this will be one of the more difficult ones. Despite that, I have
actually had some small success. If I send messages from Jabberwocky
using different thread IDs then they actually do appear in separate
Gaim windows and consequent messages to those thread IDs do get sent
to the right windows. (-: Gaim associates each chat window with a
string. It was previously using the other user's ID and I simply
changed it to use the thread ID instead. The problem is that it then
uses this &quot;window ID&quot; for many other things like adding buddies,
retrieving profile info and even replying - yes when I reply, it tries
to send the message to a user such as &quot;test thread 1&quot;. Fixing this will
require some significant modifications to the way Gaim works but I
think I can handle it.
