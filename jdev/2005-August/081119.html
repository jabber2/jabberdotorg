No, Google permits you to connect from non-google-sanctioned clients. This  
is not the case on MSN, Yahoo, or AIM. That means you can run a &quot;Google  
Talk&quot; transport on a server. This transport would use an open protocol,  
which maps surprisingly well to XMPP ;)

XMPP is desgined to allow such a situation. If they think closed is better  
than open, we'll see. They certainly seem to make a point of it, even to  
their users (not just buried in some developer site), that open is better.

I can understand why they don't want just any server with open  
registration connecting to their network. The only reason our networks  
haven't been buried in SPIM yet, is that we don't have enough users to  
make it intresting yet. Which is exactly what Google hopes to change.

This simply is one thing where &quot;we&quot;, the Jabber community, have not done  
much yet (the lack of need for it, being one of the reasons perhaps). Just  
days ago we were still talking about how it's not clear right now how  
TLS/SASL/Dailback should work together. Google apperently thinks TLS is  
very important, they'll definatly want *some* form certificate (so SASL is  
a must) to prevent an army of zombie machines to start flooding them with  
SPIM, and if they want to keep it as open as you seem to want, they'll  
definatly need dailback.

Since this was all &quot;top secret&quot; till a few hours ago, they could hardly  
come on here and have a nice chat with us about it. However, the minute  
their service went official, they already invited the community to think  
about this problem with them.
