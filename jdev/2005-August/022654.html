&gt;<i> Has Sander (or anyone else), got some time to write a first draft of a
</I>&gt;<i> new generally-useful 'Bot-Proof Challenges' JEP?
</I>
I am afraid I need to finish exams first. I also have no experience with 
writing JEPs. But if I have time again and someone wants to assist me with 
writing the JEP, I am happy to help.

&gt;<i> This could include 
</I>&gt;<i> inband delivery of images
</I>
This might have accessibility problems as noted by someone.

&gt;<i> and CPU challenges (e.g. find a string where 
</I>&gt;<i> the least significant bits of the hash have a specific value).
</I>
Maybe also the possibility to ask a random question (the server admin then can 
fill a database with multiple-choice questions) during in-band registration?

&gt;<i> The first application of that new 'building block' protocol could be
</I>&gt;<i> another new JEP that either extends or replaces JEP-0077 (In-Band
</I>&gt;<i> Registration).
</I>
&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> Once enough clients implement e2e encryption then people could insist
</I>&gt;<i> that all correspondants use it, making SPIM far more CPU-expensive.
</I>
CPU time is not so expensive, and I guess the price will go down more in the 
future. So I am afraid this is not enough.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> As Sander mentioned, the JSF-approved certificate agreement should
</I>&gt;<i> legally disallow SPIM and provide tough penalty clauses for clear
</I>&gt;<i> abuses. (These agreements would probably need to be drawn up under the
</I>&gt;<i> laws of countries that are not friendly to spammers.)
</I>
The agreement should also mean that the server admin is obliged to take 
actions when his server is used to send spim. A few things he can do:
* contacting the spimmer(s) on his server,
* blocking that spimmer(s),
* spim filtering for all outgoing trafic on s2s,
* disable registration and/or s2s connections until he fixed the problem,
* take legal actions against the spimmer on his server,
* ask advice from the Jabber community to solve the problem,
* report a leak in one of the protocols if that is causing the problem,
* etc.

So, in short, the server admin is responsible for all trafic to the public 
Jabber network coming from his server. If he ignores the agreement, he risks 
to loose his &quot;vignette&quot; (the certificate) to drive on the public Jabber 
network.

&lt;snip&gt;
