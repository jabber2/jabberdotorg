Welcome to the list! It's good to see a Google developer out here :) 
It's also really good news that the open s2s federation is official now.
To save the other readers a trip to Google cache I present you the old 
and the new text on developers.html:

Old:

     We look forward to federating with any service provider who shares 
our belief in enabling user choice and open communications. We do 
believe, however, that it is important to balance openness with ensuring 
that we maintain a safe and reliable service that protects user privacy 
and blocks spam and other abuses.



New:

     We plan to support open server-to-server federation. We do believe, 
however, that it is important to have the safeguards in place to ensure 
that we maintain a safe and reliable service that protects user privacy 
and blocks spam and other abuses.


Really good news! I'm very curious what your ideas are regarding the 
safeguards to protect user privacy and to block spam (and other abuse)...


Bart
