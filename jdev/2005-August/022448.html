I would disagree. Clients that don't support true &quot;multithreading&quot; should  
not be sending out or replying to thread ID's. After all there is no  
thread. The only way for other clients to find out wether another client  
supports threads or not is by doing this.

When a client sends back messages of type=&quot;chat&quot; without a thread ID, then  
you know there's only &quot;one thread&quot;. (thus clients that do support multiple  
threads know not to open more than one thread to that clients, because  
messages would get mixed up between them). What else would you want a  
thread ID for? To maintain some sort of session? The behaviour for that is  
*very* undefined, so I would advise not to rely on it.
