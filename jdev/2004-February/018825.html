</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (1) message queuing/processing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It seems that jabber's queuing mechanism is only dependent on a a client's &quot;online&quot; status. If a client is offline, jabber will automatically queue the messages in an offline store. But as soon as the client's online presence is detected, jabber will start &quot;pushing&quot; all queued messages to it automatically. Assuming our jabber client had no queuing mechanism, we would have to block while processing each message. Would this block-&gt;process type of method work well within the jabber framework in order to take advantage of its built in queuing mechanism? I wrote a simple client to test this type of processing and on the surface it appears to work, but I was just wondering if anyone might see other factors/issues/caveats I might not be considering before I choose this type of implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First, you may be confusing &quot;Jabber&quot; wiht specific implementations. Most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server implementations will do offline queueing as you describe,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but that's a matter of implementation and configuration. Also, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message flood that you refer to on login can be addressed with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol defined in JEP-0013.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're specifically using jabberd 1.4.3 as provided from the jabber.org site with no modifications. Based on this implementation, it appears the offline queueing is active by default. I also took a look at JEP-0013 yesterday, but is that something that is supported out of the box? I guess I'm a little confused about what JEPs actually represent. Ideally, it appears to have solved my message &quot;flooding&quot; concerns, but how can I configure jabberd to operate according to this protocol. Also, are there any issues with just blocking on my message processing loop so that I don't handle any incoming messages before finishing the message I'm currently processing? If I can implement this, the message flooding becomes a non-issue, right? 
</I>
AFAIK, neither jabberd 1.4.3 nor jabberd2.0 support JEP-0013 yet. But
jabberd2.0 will do so before jabberd 1.4.3 (if the latter ever does).

JEPs are specifications published and in some cases approved within the
Jabber standards process: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/</A>&gt;. Everything in
the Jabber world revolves around the protocols we use.

&gt;<i> &gt; I probably missed your previous messages to the list -- what kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application are you trying to write?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're planning on implementing A2A communication between a java-based jabber client app that runs on our web server and a another server-side jabber client C/C++ app. So all interaction over the jabberd transport is strictly within our internal server network. We currently have a jabber client that has built-in message queueing abilities, but we have discovered reliability issues and difficulties in scalability. So we'd like to implement a more simplified client by removing its queue mechanism &amp; extra threading, but this means offloading that process to jabberd -- which seems logical enough since it already has queueing capability. The only issue becomes controlling the flow of messages to client from the queue, which I can only do by blocking within my client's message event loop.
</I>
It seems to me that a component would meet your needs more fully, built
with something like JSO: &lt;<A HREF="http://jso.jabberstudio.org/">http://jso.jabberstudio.org/</A>&gt;.
