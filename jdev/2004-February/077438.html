It seems like a bit of a hack, but you could make all the services use 
the same base JID with a different resource for each service.  That 
way, when you subscribe to the presence of the main JID you 
automatically get presence updates for any/all of it's resources 
(services) and always know which are available.  It's certainly the 
first thing that comes to mind that would requite little/no 
modification to most clients.

</I>
 From the client perspective the base &quot;API&quot; (XML and namespaces really) 
haven't changed at all from 1 to 2.  From what I can recall most of the 
differences are either internal to the server itself, or 
additions/deprecations to the default implemented namespaces on the 
server.  Either way, they both follow the core XMPP spec fairly closely 
(in my experience).  I'm sure someone else on this list will correct me 
if I'm out of line here.
