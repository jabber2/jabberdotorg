<PRE>I know that the use of a mail server has been mentioned a few times, but that isn't the type of model we want to employ. Maybe there was some misunderstanding on what my implementation goals are. My current model implements a single jabberd 1.4.3 client that manages it's own queue to compensate for the immediate delivery mechanism of jabber. The &quot;big&quot; little client, as I like to call it, just does too much -- it both queues and processes. Ideally, I want to have a bunch of jabberd clients (all performing the same processing, dedicated only to processing, but totally independent of each other). These clients should all be connected to a central message server that has logic to queue messages destined only for these available clients, and to forward a message only if an available client asks for one. I don't want to lose the immediate delivery mechanism that jabber supports-- my clients all have the need be be able to deliver asynchronous messages in near real time back to a message source -- but I need the server to be able to manage the incoming delivery of messages to these specific clients.

I think my current frustration with jabber is based on what I thought it could do out of the box. It does not apparently behave like a true MOM, and in order to get it act like so, would require some real dedicated customization. While it does support store &amp; forward, it comes with a huge *BUT* -- but only for &quot;offline&quot; messages.

At this point, the only way to effectively use jabber as an MOM in the type of model I wish to employ is to implement a component (as Mr. Millard suggests), which could manage the queuing, load balancing, &amp; all that custom message request/forward stuff my scalable clients need. 

Thanks again for your comments. They have all been extremely helpful and informative.
