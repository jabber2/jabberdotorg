Bert,

Let me start of by apologizing for the inconvenience. However, we are trying our 
best over here so we'd appreciate a bit of understanding. We've put a disclaimer 
in the FAQ as well as a post on the front page.

The reason that we felt that we didn't have to provide a notice within the 
client is that the number of production Jabber 2 servers are still vastly out 
numbered by regular Jabber servers. We didn't want to provide a notice that 
could potentially confuse a lot of users who are unaffected.

However, if people feel very strongly that the default policy for XMPP servers 
with privacy is too restrictive, then we're willing to change it.

For now, I hope it will suffice that we put some additional information of the 
Downloads page concerning privacy.

Regards,
Dudley Carr
