You may also be able to get what you want by using a pubsub mechanism. See
JEP-60:

I agree with stpeter though, jabber is designed for near-real-time delivery. If
this doesn't fit your model, then maybe using something like an email server
would work better. Also, if you _always_ have at least one client connected,
offline messages would never exist. You also can comment out mod_offline in your
config file to turn off store-and-forward. This would mean that if a &quot;client&quot; is
not connected, then the message would bounce.

You could also write a component which JUST does the load-balancing stuff and
does it's own store-and-forward... so when one of your custom clients comes
online, it could either use JEP-013 or some custom protocol to fetch the
messages currently stored in that component. This component could also be
responsible for doing the round-robing load-balancing instead of relying on
priority changes.

There are always lots of ways to solve the problem.
