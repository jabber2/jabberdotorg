quite some time and trouble. But maybe Gush even tried to inform me. 
I cant tell, since it simply locked up and I had to kill it using the 
taskmanager.
Maybe you schould reconsider to clearly inform your users that you are 
changing the privacy rules? Honestly: How many of them will be 
looking at the FAQ?

rules so far. So I can't comment on this.
