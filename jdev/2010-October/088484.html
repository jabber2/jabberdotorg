I'm not sure we are talking about the same thing.  I want to use
something like DIGEST
authentication to send the *room* credentials and not the user's credentials.

I don't see how having a non-cleartext authentication mechanism for
MUC rooms changes any security issues that might already be present
via a MUC room service.

That's the point of using a nonce and other aspects of various
challenge base authentication mechanism.  I don't see why we would
develop a new method.
