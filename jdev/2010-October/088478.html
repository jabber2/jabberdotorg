You could use the same argument against HTTP DIGEST authentication
over https but it is well known that DIGEST is a much better choice
and offers better security in a number of ways.

Most simply, I want to be able to use something like DIGEST
authentication to keep the shared secret from being exposed.  I think
that is a simple request that is fairly straightforward to accomodate.
  A simple hash scheme doesn't protect against replay attacks and so
we do need the challenge in the mix somehow.
