The general workflow for these methods are for the client to respond
to a service challenge.  As such, the flow of elements withint the
stanzas are going to be very similar to the SASL elements in RFC 3920.

Certainly, I would prefer the error response with the non-authorized
to contain challenge response element with a mechanism named.  That
would avoid having to send the &quot;auth&quot; element when, in some cases,
there is no initial seed.

</I>&gt;<i> One of the nice things about the approach I suggest is that it introduces zero additional round-trips.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For many of these mechanisms to work properly, you need a challenge
from the service (the room service in this case) that contains,
amongst other things, a nonce from the service.  I think the
additional chatter can't be avoided.  As time can't be synchronized
across the various systems, you can' avoid having the service send the
nonce that is then used in the response.  As such, I don't think a
client-side timestamp helps that much with replay attacks.
