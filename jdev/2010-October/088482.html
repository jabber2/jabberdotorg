I feel like we're going around in circles here.  There are plenty of
reasons why digest/challenge-based authentication would be more secure
than clear-text passwords.  The MUC specification [1] doesn't define
these.  What I'm after is how something like simple DIGEST
authentication should be discovered and implemented and not really a
debate about its relative value.  I find it a valuable additional
layer and I suspect I wouldn't be alone.

There have been two different proposals--one using iq and one using
presence--that seem quite straightforward.  I prefer the presence
stanza based method.

In totality, I also want a MUC room where the password isn't shared.
I don't see anything in the specification that says that a MUC room
service can't be pre-configured with a certain number pre-registered
room members each of whom has their own set of credentials.
