</I>No. Two accounts were not really needed. They were two because of another 
reason. There is no limitation actually.
As long as accounts are different each time you can interconnect them using 
only one mediator account.
So the logic is simple: there are 6G people on the Earth. So I can estabilish 
3G sessions using only one mediator account (that is pure theory. In practice 
I do not have such hardware available).

&gt;<i> we supported one account series per psyced process.. so it would be

</I>&gt;<i> i don't understand your subtle distinction. are you refering to the web

</I>&gt;<i> proprietary network you just need to know which screenname the gateway

</I>Yes, that's it. In your case you know who you want to contact. I.e. you know 
his IM system and screenname, passing it to gateway and become connected.
In our case you do not know who will connect you. You set up a trap on your 
website put a meat and apples around it and sitting like a spider waiting for 
the victim. They come, type in their IM system and screenname and got 
connected to you.
So it is also anonymizer if you are honest enough to not write logs. You do 
not know what IM system you was contacted from and they do not know where 
their IM call landed.
