There is no msn: URI scheme.

When you say &quot;Jabber&quot; you really mean the existing (and older)
client-proxy gateways. That's a different story. Addresses other than
native JIDs are not part of XMPP, and why should they be? However, a
client could handle im: URIs if desired. Not that it's supported by the
likes of AOL, ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo.

Don't show it to the end user. That's an interface issue, not a
technical issue.

&gt;<i> Why should she put the hostname

</I>
Agreed. So we need real server to server between networks. Just get them
all to switch to XMPP...

&gt;<i> I strongly support the idea of abandoning the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A> requirement
</I>&gt;<i> for jids and let jids be opaque strings to be interpreted by the

</I>
Not going to happen.
