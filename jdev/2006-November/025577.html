</I>&gt;<i> I'll get right to the point:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Jabber MSN translated JID: fakeuser%<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">ninja.com at msn.jabber.fake.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> has been used in many places, but I don't see it in any XEPs or anything
</I>&gt;<i> like that (nothing formal).  
</I>
We talk about it in XEP-0100, no?

&gt;<i> By the same token, if you look at XEP-0106,
</I>&gt;<i> it seems like what -should- have happened is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber MSN translated JID: fakeuser\<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">40ninja.com at msn.jabber.fake.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now if a client 'renders' that, it looks like
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">fakeuser at ninja.com</A>@msn.jabber.fake.org, which is a tad confusing looking
</I>&gt;<i> in it's own right.  
</I>
True. We need full s2s with all IM networks. Don't hold your breath. :-)

&gt;<i> Also, if you are typing a jid on the command line,
</I>&gt;<i> assuming you had a command line client, that would be a pain to type. 
</I>
So don't use the command line. ;-)

&gt;<i> The argument there as that the client should handle the translation
</I>&gt;<i> before sending it off to an XMPP server.. ie I would actually type
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">fakeuser at ninja.com</A>@msn.jabber.fake.org.  
</I>
I think the end user would never type the JID. The end user would be
presented with an interface like this:

1. Choose a network:
   - AIM
   - ICQ
   - Jabber
   - MSN
   - Yahoo

2. Type an address:
   __________________

The client then adds the \40 (or old-style %) if needed based on the
network.

&gt;<i> Such things are a little
</I>&gt;<i> confusing to look at, and possibly to parse, but which is &quot;better&quot;? 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously \40 appears to be the formal way as it's in an actual XEP.
</I>
That would be the best way to handle things in the future, I think.

&gt;<i> So should those of us in the transport developing world begin the
</I>&gt;<i> process of moving from % to \40?
</I>
IMHO yes.

&gt;<i> Where did % come from?  Why is it a pseudo standard to date?
</I>
It's also been used in the email world etc. It's an ugly hack but it
works (sort of).
