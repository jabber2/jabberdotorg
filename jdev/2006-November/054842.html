That would change the idea of XMPP completely, which isn't a nice idea
IMHO. However, you could have reserved JIDs on a server like
icq:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">123456789 at jabber.org</A> (which could be alias and the server could cope
with that correctly and nothing would change for the server) and
removing the server part would mean &quot;On the same server&quot;. That is
however a problem, since it would collide with addressing server only.

Maybe something like <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">123456789 at icq</A> would be acceptable as well and the
server could have alias that icq means icq.jabber.org or so. And it
would make sense as well, since it would read 123456789 at ICQ.

Anyway, how would you handle the JIds as any string, using some
heuristics?

Have a nice day
