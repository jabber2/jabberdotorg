</I>Huh? You probably misread it. We have positive experience with serving 800 
simultaneous sessions with each sending and receiving messages every second.
And it was all running on the two accounts.

&gt;<i> the documentation is at <A HREF="http://www.psyc.eu/gatebot">http://www.psyc.eu/gatebot</A> - yeah we did not
</I>&gt;<i> provide a web interface for this, with our technology you would talk
</I>&gt;<i> to the icq gateway number and say &quot;talk xmpp:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">stpeter at jabber.org</A>&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> from psyc you would just start talking to aim:arbitraryScreenName
</I>&gt;<i> without needing to have an aim account for yourself. obviously you can
</I>&gt;<i> go through two gatebots in a row, by sending &quot;talk icq:####&quot; to the
</I>&gt;<i> gatebot on msn, etc. if icq lets you do this, maybe we should give it
</I>&gt;<i> another try, too.   :)
</I>Hm. Ok, that is possible way to go. But your solution is targeted as 'chatting 
out' to other network while we targeting _receiving_ incoming chat sessions 
from otherwise incompartible networks.

&gt;<i> i was thinking of supporting presence and some other things across these
</I>&gt;<i> gateways too. in the case of the ircgate, it even relays the negotiation
</I>&gt;<i> of file transfers (ctcp dcc).
</I>File transfer was considered but was not set as a priority.

&gt;<i> p.s. update on the ircnet peering gateway: brasnet is experimentally
</I>&gt;<i> running this now, and so far it is working. you can reach any registered
</I>&gt;<i> user by <A HREF="psyc://psyc.brasnet.org/~user">psyc://psyc.brasnet.org/~user</A> or xmpp:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at psyc.brasnet.org</A> -
</I>&gt;<i> they plan to replace their traditional jabberd on brasnet.org with this.
</I>&gt;<i> in our experimental labs we have already had some psyc/jabber users
</I>&gt;<i> JOIN an ircnet channel.
</I>Ok, thank you. I'll give it a try.
