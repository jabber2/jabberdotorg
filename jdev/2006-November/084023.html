</I>

Well, I just think I do not need to _parse_ it if I'm not interested in
the information there. I only want to split it to parts and feed that to
different program.

&gt;<i> As Matthias already mentioned some developers see the complete stream 
</I>&gt;<i> (including the header) as one XML Document, others use the header only 
</I>&gt;<i> to grab the correct namespace and see each stanza as a new DOM which is 
</I>&gt;<i> not in the context of the stream header.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All techniques have their pros and cons which also strongly depends on 
</I>&gt;<i> your programming language and XML libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It also depends on your project and requirements. It's a big difference 
</I>&gt;<i> if you need a light and really fast implementation for a embedded 
</I>&gt;<i> device, or if you don't care about speed but want a complete namespace 
</I>&gt;<i> correct and validating implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I need to make it many small independent programs. Which I think nobody
yet did. It is just an experiment, maybe it wont work at all, it is
possible something very flexible may become of it, I just do not know.

Thank you for your comments.
