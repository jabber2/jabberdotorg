Sure, I don't mean to discourage the general idea of XMPP over SCTP, I just 
think it is overkill for the particular problem we are discussing.

And to reply to the earlier posts: I also don't think SCTP can be reduced to a 
footnote in the XMPP-Core RFC.  More likely, it would have to be an entire 
spec of its own, similar in nature to HTTP Binding.  There's a lot to 
consider about how the various features may be used in an XMPP context, and a 
whole boatload of issues when you start talking about federation.  That said, 
I, too, would find an &quot;SCTP Binding&quot; spec interesting.
