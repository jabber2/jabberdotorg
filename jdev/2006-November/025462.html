Yes, but from that, you can deduce what _was_ acknowledged.

And if you loose TCP ack, TCP will take care of it. If you loose
datal-level ack, TCP will take care of it the same, there is no
difference.

&gt;<i> I

</I>
I guess it is not much used and documented, I just heard it exists.

&gt;<i> But this isn't quite the same thing anyway - you want to know what 
</I>&gt;<i> stanzas have been accepted - what happens if the ACKs get lost, or 
</I>&gt;<i> the server dies?
</I>
If they get lost, they will arrive later. If the server dies, same is if
it did not have enough time to send the data-level one, no?

But anyway, I just said it can be done, but I also said it would be
difficult and wouldn't be the best thing anyway, I think.

Somebody ran the operating system through a spelling checker.
