<PRE>Hi folk,

Today I was having a discussion with another developer about one of  
the 'standards' that's been in place for a little while and it got me  
waffling back and forth as to whether it's a &quot;good&quot; standard or not.   
I'll get right to the point:

MSN username: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">fakeuser at ninja.com</A>
Jabber MSN translated JID: fakeuser%<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">ninja.com at msn.jabber.fake.org</A>

So where did this use of % come from?  It seems to work out well, and  
has been used in many places, but I don't see it in any XEPs or  
anything like that (nothing formal).  By the same token, if you look  
at XEP-0106, it seems like what -should- have happened is:

Jabber MSN translated JID: fakeuser\<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">40ninja.com at msn.jabber.fake.org</A>

Now if a client 'renders' that, it looks like  
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">fakeuser at ninja.com</A>@msn.jabber.fake.org, which is a tad confusing  
looking in it's own right.  Also, if you are typing a jid on the  
command line, assuming you had a command line client, that would be a  
pain to type.  The argument there as that the client should handle  
the translation before sending it off to an XMPP server.. ie I would  
actually type <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">fakeuser at ninja.com</A>@msn.jabber.fake.org.  Such things  
are a little confusing to look at, and possibly to parse, but which  
is &quot;better&quot;?  Obviously \40 appears to be the formal way as it's in  
an actual XEP.

So should those of us in the transport developing world begin the  
process of moving from % to \40?
Where did % come from?  Why is it a pseudo standard to date?

I'm quite interested to hear other's thoughts on this.  =)
