As you may know, we thought very seriously about making the default
behaviour for the next release of Prosody to require trusted and valid
certificates on all s2s connections. Ultimately we decided against it,
for now. But I remain optimistic that we shall do so in a future
version (perhaps after making a POSH verification module available).

Name another protocol as widespread as XMPP that has solved them so far...? :)

At least I think we're on the right track, but with things like this I
think it takes baby-steps. We have come a long way, many clients and
servers require encryption on c2s now which simply wasn't true a few
years ago.

Regards,
Matthew

PS. Anecdotal, but currently on my server:

40 &quot;secure&quot; incoming s2s connections (trusted+valid certificate)
37 encrypted with invalid/self-signed certificates
10 not encrypted at all

3 of the unencrypted connections are from the personal servers of
prominent members of the XMPP community (you [hopefully] know who you
are). A further 2 are domains I'm responsible for (and a server
upgrade is already scheduled to fix them), the remaining ones are
gmail.com and Google-hosted domains.
