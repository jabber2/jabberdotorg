<PRE>Hi Michal,

once I tried to introduce such an application/proxy for jabber. I worked
on for a very long time whatever I did never get any positiv feedback
and therefor I did stopped spending more time on it. :/

If you are interested:

<A HREF="http://wxxcd.sourceforge.net/">http://wxxcd.sourceforge.net/</A>

basically the &quot;daemon&quot; should compile on linux, too.
if you are really interested I would try to find the last(=current)
source I wrote. (I am not sure if the source in cvs is the latest)

Well, it was already working :/ but nobody wanted to develop an
application on top of it :(

regards,
you may contact me via jabber

&gt;<i>Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>I was thinking this way: There are apearing some applications that do some 
</I>&gt;<i>tasks and their primary purpose is not comunication. However, they comunicate 
</I>&gt;<i>using jabber. (inkskape for example, if I remember well). Users want games in 
</I>&gt;<i>IM clients, which has nothing to do with IM. UNIX filosophy tells to separate 
</I>&gt;<i>different tasks into separate programs. So yes, it would be possible to 
</I>&gt;<i>separate the games into different programs, which would be just called from 
</I>&gt;<i>the client with right info (where to connect, which user try to contact and 
</I>&gt;<i>everything).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>However, this would mean the game mush have full supprt for things like XML 
</I>&gt;<i>parsing, SASL, TLS and everything. It would mean another connection to server 
</I>&gt;<i>as well, which would mean more load on server, need to keep the connection 
</I>&gt;<i>using whitespace pings (which means more pings with more connections) and 
</I>&gt;<i>another resource appears for other users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So I was thinking about something like is X server. On a user login, it would 
</I>&gt;<i>start and connect and provided kind of user proxy for all his application, 
</I>&gt;<i>making it only one connecion and making the life for applications a bit 
</I>&gt;<i>easier by handling the SASL, TLS, transparent merging of more accounts 
</I>&gt;<i>together, and more extensions like file transfers, jingle and so on. It would 
</I>&gt;<i>mean even transparent handling of history, regardless if it is server-side or 
</I>&gt;<i>client-side, support of new features for application which did not have it 
</I>&gt;<i>before (like it would be possible to add encrypted sessions to all 
</I>&gt;<i>applications without them knowing about it, for example).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Another advantage would be, if the graphic frontend crashed (and the graphic 
</I>&gt;<i>application tend to do so more oftenly then simple text ones, I don't know 
</I>&gt;<i>why), you would not lose your last messages and messages got on the last 
</I>&gt;<i>moment, you could just start the app again and it would get them, and other 
</I>&gt;<i>users would not even know something happend to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Of course, the design would need to be done more properly, but I wanted 
</I>&gt;<i>someone to comment on this a bit, if it is a good idea. I'm sending it here, 
</I>&gt;<i>because I think it has nothing to do with standards, it is just another way 
</I>&gt;<i>for a design for client software. If you think otherwise, I appologise and 
</I>&gt;<i>would move it to better mail list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thank you.
