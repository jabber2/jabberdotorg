Well, as I know, the compression can be done in TLS, not SASL. SASL is
only few stanzas at the beginning to send a password, whilest the whole
stream is piped trough the TLS only usually, right? And it is a good
place for it anyway, as encryption makes the data look more
unpredictable, which is good for encryption.

I'm not expert for either of them, but I guess compresion in TLS makes
sence, in SASL doesn't..
