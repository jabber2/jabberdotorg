Well, seeing the emerging aplication to use jabber in some ways (inkskape, 
there is some discusion on koffice...), it may be the right time.

Alright, so I will try to think about how it would look like and make some 
kind of prototype with limited functionality. Actually, it was an idea as 
something I would like to do as summer of code project, but someone would 
have to mentor it for me. (and I would have to find out if the high school 
I'm leaving in about a month would provide me with the papers that I'm a 
student).

As a demonstration, I would maybe add some kind of really primitive command 
line client that would use some of it's features.
