<PRE>interesting :)

well, just as I am curious, do you think this could become part of
KDE/Gnome one day? Basically the concept is similar to mine with XCD but
I was not using D-Bus.

Anyway it would be nice if it can be intergrated into a desktop like
KDE, in example you could browse (disco) with konqueror to xmpp:// -
konquerer extension could then offer GUI for the xmpp features offered
by a server/client/component. In this case it could be integrated into
Kopete as well ...
In Kontrollzentrum you could also add a config feature.

But I am sure you know about this already...

regards

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Why do simple things in complicated way?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Because it's not a simple thing. If you want to create a protocol which
</I>&gt;<i>can act as proxy for any arbitrary real-time communication protocol you
</I>&gt;<i>care to name, trying expose less complexity to client authors who don't
</I>&gt;<i>care about the perculiar features of a given protocol, but not
</I>&gt;<i>restricting the extensibility of those who do, it's absolutely not a
</I>&gt;<i>trivial problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's similar in form to the problem which XMPP itself aims to solve
</I>&gt;<i>(making a protocol which is extensible enough to gateway on to other
</I>&gt;<i>protocols and extend with new features), and you can hardly say the
</I>&gt;<i>overall result of that is simple, but we've decided to use D-Bus as our
</I>&gt;<i>basic transport because it has bindings to most popular object systems
</I>&gt;<i>(glib, qt, python, perl, c#...) that make coding against it pretty easy
</I>&gt;<i>to get going.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you want something which *is* simple, and discards all of the
</I>&gt;<i>features of different networks, perhaps Bitlbee would be what you
</I>&gt;<i>wanted. Everything then becomes just an IRC network where you can only
</I>&gt;<i>send/receive plain text, but it's just not what the goal of the
</I>&gt;<i>Telepathy project is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>And why the hell not separate different things as much as possible?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We are all in favour of this. Our goal is that protocol code is
</I>&gt;<i>seperated into backend D-Bus services. Front-end clients which implement
</I>&gt;<i>particular functionality like managing your contacts, text chats, voice
</I>&gt;<i>calls, file transfers, etc, interact with different objects provided by
</I>&gt;<i>these backend services. Different communication types are split out into
</I>&gt;<i>different objects - we have a Connection object which represents your
</I>&gt;<i>server connection, from which you can request or be given Channels to
</I>&gt;<i>perform communications over, of the various types I've mentioned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Why not use sime pipe or network socket directly?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Because then client authors would have to write their own
</I>&gt;<i>marshalling/demarshalling code. That's about all libdbus does, and a
</I>&gt;<i>daemon to route messages based on what people have said they do and
</I>&gt;<i>don't want to receive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I wanted to provide just a proxy, that would be able to filter the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>stanzas out, send them to server and allow some more control using some other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>XML. But not move all the ways of comunication to some daemon and not be able 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to send custom data that are not supported by the procedure of RPC for sure?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What on earth are you talking about? D-Bus has a completely recursive
</I>&gt;<i>arbitrary type system. You can send arbitrary structures, arrays, maps,
</I>&gt;<i>primitive types or any combination of those in any method call, reply,
</I>&gt;<i>signal or error. So you can send strings, integers, byte arrays, hash
</I>&gt;<i>tables of strings to arbitrary types, whatever. There is no limitation
</I>&gt;<i>in the type system I've run into so far, it's pretty elegant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Why does all the freedesktop projects seem to me as an attempt to make linux 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>as bad as windows? :-(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ignoring this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Sorry if I may seem as an extremist here, but this seems to me as a bad thing. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This would disallow the extensibility of the protocol, if used.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Nonsense. Telepathy is created from the ground up to allow extra types
</I>&gt;<i>of communication channel to be added, extra interfaces added to existing
</I>&gt;<i>channel or connection objects. Our XMPP backend is our main focus at the
</I>&gt;<i>moment, and it's a very good chance to show how we can expose the power
</I>&gt;<i>and flexibility of the XMPP protocol within the Telepathy interface,
</I>&gt;<i>splitting out different tasks like file transfer, audio calls, MUC
</I>&gt;<i>chats, etc, into the respective channel types within our specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As I've just posted to our (admittedly rather quiet) mailing list, we
</I>&gt;<i>think it's going reasonably well at the moment:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/telepathy/2006-April/000026.html">http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/telepathy/2006-April/000026.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We're aware of three frontend projects currently on the go, and nobody
</I>&gt;<i>has come back to us to say the concept is entirely broken and our
</I>&gt;<i>approach overcomplicated. It's still possible to write something like 10
</I>&gt;<i>lines of Python and send messages to someone, but by adding more
</I>&gt;<i>functionality you can take part in a Jabber MUC and manage the room
</I>&gt;<i>members and settings, place voice calls, manage your roster, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We're definitely receptive to feedback about how our approach can be
</I>&gt;<i>improved, and would love to discuss how we can make Telepathy serve your
</I>&gt;<i>needs better. It is, after all, intended as a standardisation effort.
