Well, if I know, it verifies only the needed ones, not all, and when it
uses the key.

And, anyway, I think the time to load is not caused by the EXE, but by
the antivirus you speak about. And the encryption itself is much more
time consuming than the loading, at last without the antivirus you speak
about.

But they do not do anything, they are tool. This one does. And could you
imagine, what would happen, if you started up this library, loaded the
keys and let it running. Then you just marked a key as untrusted. What
would happen? It would make some kind of data corrupt, or in the best
case, would take the key still as trusted.

Well, I already have seen this somewhere, I do not remember what client
id did.


You can have one preloaded instance of gpg running, after use, in the
background, preload another (it would be fast enought), or encrypt on
background, while user is typping and send after the, quite small delay,
but letting him write the new one.

By the way, I somehow managed to get into some internal shell of it,
maybe it supports encrypting messages and not turning it off, but I do
not know for sure and I do not remember the switch.


Anyway, GPG was designed to run under UNIX systems, where launching a
binary is really fast (it has to be, since many good application use
external programs for different actions, which menas configurability and
not duplexing of code) and then it was ported to windows. Windows is not
the main target platform for this, as I guess. (It is used from
commandline, for example, which is quite a problem there)
