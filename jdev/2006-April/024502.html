It took this long for the true reason to appear in the thread -- Windows is 
slow at forking (actually it doesn't &quot;fork&quot; as such) new processes, while 
practically every other OS is fast.  This is why Windows doesn't have the 
mentality of using existing executables to perform tasks, but uses DLLs 
instead.

One might say that the correct mentality for porting to Windows is to provide 
a DLL to eliminate startup costs, but unfortunately that's going to take 
someone's time, and most people would spend less time migrating to an OS that 
doesn't suck, than would be spent changing something like GnuPG to work as a 
shared library.
