Thanks for that recommendation. However, JXTA seems quite bloated - I've
spent hours reading their documentation and still haven't really figured out
what JXTA supports. (The Smack API documentation, which provides only
Jabber, seems much easier to read)

Is JXTA  just a proprietary SOAP-equivalent (don't we already have enough
RPC facilities?), or does it also provide transport and discovery
facilities? It seems JXTA doesn't have the discovery stuff (i.e. a buddy
list), so what you are recommending that I use Jabber to discover my peers,
and then use JXTA for the point-to-point communication, right?

Does anyone here have experience with JXTA, and can comment on how easy it
is to get into it?

Cheers,

  Tobias
