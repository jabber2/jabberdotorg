</I>SASL can also provide privacy and/or integrity, too. It can provide 
strong encryption in fewer round-trips than TLS, as well. And 
usually, SASL doesn't send a password - it only does so with PLAIN 
and the non-standard LOGIN mechanisms.


&gt;<i> I'm not expert for either of them, but I guess compresion in TLS

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>A SASL mechanism could provide compression. None do, as far as I 
know, but they could.

In any case, the important factor isn't so much when the compression 
gets negotiated, but where it's applied - compression is adding a 
layer into the stack. Normally, it's easiest to add a layer in at the 
top of a running connection, so you'd add it in after any encryption 
has been negotiated.

If you know you're not going to negotiate a privacy/intergrity layer 
in SASL, you could negotiate it beforehand, thus compressing the SASL 
exchange for a slight saving. On a server, you could refuse to 
provide encryption/integrity via SASL if compression was in effect, 
or you could assume the client knew what it was doing if you were 
capable of inserting a layer.

So it's typically going to be one of:

1) TLS -&gt; Comp -&gt; SASL(no encrypt)
2) SASL(encrypt) -&gt; Comp
3) TLS -&gt; Comp -&gt; Auth

(and non recommended)

4) Comp -&gt; Auth
5) Comp -&gt; SASL(no encrypt)

And always, the result should be that data is first compressed, then 
any SASL encoding is applied, then any TLS.

In general, SASL exchanges compress by around 20% on ESMTP, IMAP, and 
XMPP because they're base64 encoded. In ACAP (and presumably LDAP, 
although I've not looked), they don't compress as well because 
they're transmitted in binary.

By the way, I was meaning to ask why the stream compression mechanism 
uses zlib format rather than just deflate blocks? zlib just 
introduces overhead - it's for compressing files, not streams. TLS 
(and both application-level compression proposals for IMAP) use pure 
deflate. HTTP uses gzip and zlib (confusingly it calls zlib 
&quot;deflate&quot;), but then, it's designed to handle precompressed files on 
the server, so this is a somewhat different circumstance.
