Different things come to mind:
- Clients shouldn't really encourage non-standard behaviour, so i  
would personally not support this myself.
- If you really want to support Google Talk, you can get away with a  
regexp match on the JID, and enable all these non-standard  
extensions. No other server is using these anyway. As long as GT  
doesn't change the allowable email addresses, you're safe.
- Since blocking is a task not often done, you can do it failure- 
driven: try blocking using iq:privacy (which is rather complicated  
right now, see below) if you think the server supports it, and then  
try this way if it fails. Pretty ugly still, but there is no way to  
cleanly support non-standard things on a server that does not  
advertise its extensions.

This said, apart from GT not advertizing its extension in disco, i  
don't blame them for not supporting iq:privacy. It's very hard to use  
this protocol directly client-side for tasks as blocking or  
invisibility. A simple profile of this protocol should be made that  
blocks, unblocks and makes you invisible with one simple iq. I heard  
stpeter has this somewhere on his TODO.

cheers,
Remko
