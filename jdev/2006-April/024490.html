<PRE>   Hello, Justin!

JK&gt; As far as I know, the GnuPG developers intentially don't provide a DLL
JK&gt; form of the program.  This is why even GPGME (GnuPG Made Easy, the
JK&gt; official library for apps to use) calls gpg.exe behind the scenes.

Yep, probably because that EXE should be completely rewritten to allow to 
use the existing code as DLL.. For example, right now it uses global 
varibles instead of context structures. That's why I was looking for a brave 
guy :=)

JK&gt; Having GnuPG in &quot;DLL&quot; form would only save you the time to load GnuPG
JK&gt; into memory, which is probably not where your cpu cycles are going.

I have an expirience in working with the standard PGP SDK, it's lightning 
fast if you have the properly initialized context. And programs like JAJC 
also have no problems with PGP SDK based encryption.

JK&gt; How fast is your computer?  Encrypting a GnuPG message for Psi is on
JK&gt; average faster than the rate someone would chat, I think.

Unfortunately Miranda is very popular among the Win95 users, who launch it 
on PII/233 machines with 64M RAM :) For these users launching a quite fat 
EXE on every message is a mess (sorry for a tautology :)

Even on a PIV/2800 with 1GB RAM it takes about 200-300 msec to launch the 
gnupg.exe and process its result. Such a delay itself is a mess for a user 
who can type quickly.
