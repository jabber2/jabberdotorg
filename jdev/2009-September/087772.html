Once a year, the XMPP Standards Foundation holds elections for its Board
of Directors and for the XMPP Council. That time is now, so the XSF is
actively soliciting people to stand for election. Here is the division
of responsibilities between the two groups:

   1. The Board provides business leadership for the XSF by handling
things like fundraising, contracts, grants, legal issues, planning the
XMPP Summit meetings, and choosing volunteers for various official posts
such as the Secretary and Executive Director. Those who serve on the
Board are not required to be elected members of the XSF.

   2. The Council provides technical leadership for the XSF by managing
the XSF's standards process, deciding which proposals to accept as
official XEPs, voting on advancement of XEPs through the process from
Experimental to Draft to Final, and providing oversight for the
functions of the XMPP Extensions Editor and the XMPP Registrar. Those
who serve on the XMPP Council are required to be elected members of the XSF.

If you are interested in standing for election, please visit
<A HREF="http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Board_and_Council_Elections_2009">http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Board_and_Council_Elections_2009</A> and create a
page about your candidacy by the close of business on Friday, September
11, 2009.
