<PRE>Andr&#233;,
thank you for your efforts in trying to bring more people to XMPP. I
hope many here are doing the same.
Among German academic institutions, there is a gentle, but steady push
forward for XMPP. Besides the weak spot of mobile support, I see two
points:
* There are a few steps until XMPP works as desired:
  - The account does not automatically come with the application or
vice versa
  - Your contacts are not immediately visible and active
* It is hard to do XMPP hosting
These issues are being addressed, but they have not seen the momentum
yet:
* To solve the account/app problem, we (especially Klaus!) have been
working hard on making XMPP integrated into web applications used e.g.
in the educational environment with the JSXC JavaScript XMPP Client.
Plugins for applications ranging from ownCloud to Ilias (e-learning
[2]), but also SOGo [3] or Diaspora* [4] have been developed to make it
easier to integrate XMPP into these collaborative applications, many of
which follow the federation model of XMPP. (The ownCloud and Diaspora*
teams have been especially supportive, thanks!)
* We are working on easy and automatic ways to sync information from
the authentication service into group into the roster.
* There is work underway to simplify multi-domain secure hosting using
DANE or POSH. I hope that client support will start soon.
Yes, it is late, but I don't think it is too late. However, this
requires the XMPP developer community to start addressing these issues
in their projects or help other projects achieving this goal.

&gt;<i> I have been trying to use and to bring more people to use xmpp, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;<i> hard - as you may already know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have an email account that integrated our account with a xmpp, and
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> automatically log our conversations in a mail folder. I liked this
</I>&gt;<i> feature
</I>&gt;<i> a lot, but now it is being abandoned by Fastmail, as anounced in
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> blog.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Their arguments to abandon xmpp seems reasonable. But if I saw and
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> show them any reasonable thing to dissolve their arguments, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> would keep this feature. And more than that, maybe xmpp would grow
</I>&gt;<i> instead
</I>&gt;<i> of slowly dying, like I'm seeing it. My view is limited, but even so
</I>&gt;<i> it is
</I>&gt;<i> bigger than most other people's view that I know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP does not have mobile clients as good as the variety and quality
</I>&gt;<i> of PC
</I>&gt;<i> clients. Xabber and Yaxim seems the best one. But they are too
</I>&gt;<i> limited
</I>&gt;<i> compared with other protocols' clients, and also compared with PC
</I>&gt;<i> clients,
</I>&gt;<i> as I said.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Google abandoned XMPP, fine. I don't need it as a search engine.
</I>&gt;<i> There are
</I>&gt;<i> better options, more respectable and without contradictions as time
</I>&gt;<i> goes
</I>&gt;<i> by. And there are others that are keeping XMPP somehow, but they're
</I>&gt;<i> lacking one basic incentive: give a few reasons for us users to use
</I>&gt;<i> it! So
</I>&gt;<i> the user number is not kept as small and rare as it is now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Xabber: needs more developers! Needs improvements. Yaxim also needs
</I>&gt;<i> it. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know other clients, but these two are used by a few friends of
</I>&gt;<i> mine
</I>&gt;<i> (the very few ones who use these client to talk basically only with
</I>&gt;<i> me -
</I>&gt;<i> that's sad but true!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sad thing. But I hope that this list will (maybe, who knows without
</I>&gt;<i> trying) show me some better things than the one of the kind the I
</I>&gt;<i> described a bit above here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See you around,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Andr&#233;
