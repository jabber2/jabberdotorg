Our on-boarding process is nothing like as easy as the somewhat commonplace &quot;Download app, run app, do some registration dance&quot; - instead it's &quot;Download app, go to some website, go to some other website and try to figure out how to create an account, configure app.&quot;

To me, the big issue with registration is making it easy for a user to
determine which server is right for them. It's a decision most of us
wouldn't take lightly. The user needs to realize it's more than just a
JID domain name selection, but a relationship that they are entering
into with the service provider. I like the idea of tossing the user to a
website because it helps start building that relationship.
