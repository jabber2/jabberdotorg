<PRE>I have been trying to use and to bring more people to use xmpp, but it's
hard - as you may already know.

I have an email account that integrated our account with a xmpp, and could
automatically log our conversations in a mail folder. I liked this feature
a lot, but now it is being abandoned by Fastmail, as anounced in their
blog.

Their arguments to abandon xmpp seems reasonable. But if I saw and could
show them any reasonable thing to dissolve their arguments, maybe they
would keep this feature. And more than that, maybe xmpp would grow instead
of slowly dying, like I'm seeing it. My view is limited, but even so it is
bigger than most other people's view that I know.

XMPP does not have mobile clients as good as the variety and quality of PC
clients. Xabber and Yaxim seems the best one. But they are too limited
compared with other protocols' clients, and also compared with PC clients,
as I said.

Google abandoned XMPP, fine. I don't need it as a search engine. There are
better options, more respectable and without contradictions as time goes
by. And there are others that are keeping XMPP somehow, but they're
lacking one basic incentive: give a few reasons for us users to use it! So
the user number is not kept as small and rare as it is now.

Xabber: needs more developers! Needs improvements. Yaxim also needs it. I
don't know other clients, but these two are used by a few friends of mine
(the very few ones who use these client to talk basically only with me -
that's sad but true!).

Sad thing. But I hope that this list will (maybe, who knows without
trying) show me some better things than the one of the kind the I
described a bit above here.

See you around,

Andr&#233;
