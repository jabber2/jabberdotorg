Our on-boarding process is nothing like as easy as the somewhat commonplace &quot;Download app, run app, do some registration dance&quot; - instead it's &quot;Download app, go to some website, go to some other website and try to figure out how to create an account, configure app.&quot;

I think there&#8217;s a fair argument for simply having an advertised HTTPS endpoint for servers that clients could then present to the user. It&#8217;s not as satisfying to do it out of band, but it&#8217;s also very often what these easy-to-register-with apps do, and it&#8217;s somewhat richer than 77.
