I just mean /usr/local/var/jspool on the net.  Jabber-transport 1.0
gets presence and subscription information, offline messages etc.
from a local disk file, like ----------
    file = open('/usr/local/var/jspool/%s.xml' % user)
    data = file.read()
    file.close()
    state = parse_xml(data)

and a network version doesn't need to be much more complex --------
    net.write('get %s\r\n' % user)
    data = net.read()
    state = parse_xml(data)
    verify_user_state(state, user)    # check for ``user not found''

This addresses the specific problem, that the disk file is local to
one host when you might need several hosts to support the service,
and it can solve that problem better than NFS-mounting the file.

The protocol can be bone-head simple, I'd think.  I could write an
application in 15 minutes (in C, 2 minutes in Python), no need for
BER encoding or any of the other fun stuff that requires external
library support for LDAP applications.  The hair is on the service
end, where for a first cut I'd probably go with a jspool-like
filesystem approach (but with an artificial directory hierarchy, to
avoid mammoth directory rewrites.)

My point is not to push one approach, though.  I'm just asking,
is there an application here for LDAP because of its technical
merits, am I missing something about the problem?

I don't really know what all will go in this xdb space.  It looks
to me like /user/spool/mail.  Files would certainly be shorter on
average, but subject to radical ballooning with a few offline
messages with video &amp; audio.  I suppose there would have to
be some kind of quota, and expiration, but you'd have to be able
to store on the order of megabytes per request.
