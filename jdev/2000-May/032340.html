<PRE>I just wanted to keep everyone in the loop:

For those that didn't notice, the 1.0 server release was uploaded Monday
to: <A HREF="http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.0/">http://download.jabber.org/dists/1.0/</A>  I'll be writing an announcement
for it and sending that out hopefully tonight.

Also, we have a brand new jabber.org website, thanks to mod_virgule by
raph, which is what advogato.org is based on.  It's live but still in
&quot;test&quot; mode, so check it out and help get its integration smoothed out in
the next few days.  We appreciate any/all feedback to the
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">web-dev at jabber.org</A> mailing list, join if you're interested in helping!

For those that don't know, you'll see a link from the new jabber.org to
the jabber.com and jabbercentral.com sites, looks for some announcements
about these in the *very* near future :)

One last thing, I'm going to be writing a &quot;Project Status Update&quot; on the
project as a whole within the next two weeks, and we'll have as many
components (transports, clients, libraries) released by that time.  The
intention is to make Jabber a little more presentable and bring everything
in sync.

Thanks again to everyone who's helped in some way, it's been a busy few
months!

Jer


PS: I apologize I don't participate more on JDEV, time... *sigh*  If you
ever have a critical issue that you need my attention on, catch me via
jabber at <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jer at jabber.org</A> or ask around in #jabber on irc.openprojects.net.
