</I>
    How about coda or intermezzo?  I think that the NFS-mounting idea
is terrific, except for that fact that NFS implementations have performance
and security issues (coda and intermezzo wouldn't eliminate the security
issues, but the mounting could then happen over an expensive transport
like IPSec or SSL without degrading performance).

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point is not to push one approach, though.  I'm just asking,
</I>&gt;<i> is there an application here for LDAP because of its technical

</I>
    LDAP has no technical merits (or demerits) in this context.  It's not
an implementation design, it's an interface design!  As an interface it's
probably not well suited to Jabber, because it's hierarchical, which jabber
namespace is not.
