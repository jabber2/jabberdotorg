<PRE>Hello all,
    I tried this morning to again install the server and just connect up
to it send messages and see that I had it installed correctly.

I was installing on a debian linux machine.
Previously v. 0.8 was installed and this was an attempt at using 
server 1.0 pre 2

EKS!&quot;!  Luckily I had version 0.8 orginally on the machine.

It had a copy of etherxd in /usr/local/bin...

So the server orginally seemed to come up.
The client I was trying to use was  jinxtest 0.7  (I thought it was
a recent version of it but I may be wrong)

Anyhow, I could connect add a user and then I would see a user.xml file
created for the account. I could not connect backup with that user
and send a message.


Anyhow it did not totally work.  So I cleaned my directories.
reconfigured, recompiled re installed.  and got that the jserver
could not find the etherxd.  Where is that these days?  


I would love if we could have a reference implementation

where you could using 3 screens.  run jserver in one window.
run  Jinxtest in the other two windows and run.

window 1:  jnixtest -n <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user1 at myserver</A> test
window 1:  quit
window 2:  jnixtest -n <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user2 at myserver</A> test
window 2:  quit
window 1:  jnixtest <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user1 at myserver</A> test
window 2:  jnixtest <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user2 at myserver</A> test
window 1:  ? user2

(then get a confirm that there is a user two on the system)
window 1:  m  / user2/testing/ testing      (note: replace the / with return)

and then on window 2 you would see   message from user1 testing.


Is this what we should be able to see?
