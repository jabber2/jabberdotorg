<PRE>Unfortunately this functionality is not supported by icq-t, and really can't
be without a major portion being rewritten.

Users on ICQ are represented by &lt;uin&gt;@&lt;transport server&gt; you would have to
have people as &lt;their uin&gt;%&lt;my uin&gt;@&lt;transport server&gt; to distinguish which
registered account you were sending from.

I was pushing for this a while ago, but it just isn't a feature enough
people want.

The only real way you can do this is to track down other ICQ transport
servers (icq.jabber.com may be one) and register the separate accounts on
THOSE machines. Transports do not need to be 'connected' in some special way
to the local server except to have them listed in menus and to have them
launched in tandem. You can connect to remote machines and use their
functionality, although many current clients probably have a hard time with
this :)

Have fun!

Subject: [JDEV] Question about multiple agents


Hi,
I am developing a client in which I want to run multiple agents, for
example I have two different ICQ numbers and would like to register both
of them as agents. When I send my second register xml stream i get
&quot;Remote Server Error&quot;
Is this something that you shouldnt do or is work in progress on this?

Would appreciate all help

Best regards, Niklas
