<PRE>&gt;<i> We should be prepared to answer the question why Jabber? My sister has a
</I>&gt;<i> Skype account and her friends also have one. Why should she download
</I>&gt;<i> this Jabber thing? Don't answer with freedom and open -- that has no
</I>&gt;<i> meaning for the average user.
</I>
As a goal, this doesn't say much to the average user indeed. However,
you could swing it in a way that says &quot;Connects/Works with/... popular
services such as Google Talk, Live Journal, ...&quot; Security could indeed
also appeal to some (I think people like to hear that what they're
doing is 'secure', they don't even need to understand). Accountability
and transparency, that I don't really know why that would be useful.

I agree we should make a strong case for switching. And that's why we
need deployed and working features such as Jingle to leverage this.

cheers,
Remko
