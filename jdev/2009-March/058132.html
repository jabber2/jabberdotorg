<PRE>IMHO this is similar to what pubsub.com used to do. They built their
application on top of XEP-0060 but their filtering semantics were not
built into the protocol.

</I>&gt;<i> (3) Server picks up message (via asynchronous MQ or via XMPP component -

</I>&gt;<i> (4) Server needs to flexibly broadcast message out to a large number of
</I>&gt;<i> users but (and this is key) this list of users needs to be dynamically
</I>&gt;<i> filtered
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I originally was hoping PubSub would work but that seems to rely on a
</I>&gt;<i> fixed node with a fixed set of subscribers.  In my scenario, I may have
</I>&gt;<i> fixed nodes but I don't want to push a message out to all subscribers -
</I>&gt;<i> just a dynamically chosen subset of those (based on some filter
</I>&gt;<i> parameters).  Some options I've considered include:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Pushing out the messages to all members of the node and letting a
</I>&gt;<i> custom XMPP client filter them.  This makes the server simple but
</I>&gt;<i> results in possibly many messages being sent to many &quot;receiving&quot; clients
</I>&gt;<i> when a subset would have worked.  Considering there may also be a large
</I>&gt;<i> volume of user-submitted messages coming in to trigger this, minimizing
</I>&gt;<i> the number of outbound messages is critical from a scalability standpoint.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Not sure if this is possible but in the routing chain could we build a
</I>&gt;<i> component that would intercept the pubsub messages and apply the
</I>&gt;<i> filtering there?  Not sure if it's possible to do this generally for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;all broadcast recipients&quot; or if the code would have to be called once
</I>&gt;<i> for every message recipient which would then again kill
</I>&gt;<i> performance/scalability as the load grows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The inbound item picked up off the queue could also be used to
</I>&gt;<i> determine the list of valid recipients, and then.....I assume....loop
</I>&gt;<i> through them one at a time and send them individiual messages??  Again,
</I>&gt;<i> seems to work at a small scale but maybe not at a large scale?  Is there
</I>&gt;<i> a way to build a dynamic list of users and have XMPP send messages to
</I>&gt;<i> that list?  Are there practical limitations on handling the size of this
</I>&gt;<i> list or are there &quot;sharding&quot; approaches for big XMPP broadcasts like this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any advice or lessons learned by XMPP veterans would be greatly
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated.  I apologize in advance for the lengthy message.
