</I>Well, I'm certainly not denying that any officially selected client  
would have a massive advantage, but I think all clients would benefit  
from attempting to be the chosen one, and as long as we were careful  
about reselecting the client on a regular basis for each platform, I  
think that wouldn't end with one client being selected.

</I>Ah, but ejabberd certainly derives a massive advantage by running the  
jabber.org service. You can't quite describe it as the official  
server, but you could quite easily describe it as the server chosen  
to run the flagship Jabber service sponsored by the XSF, or in any  
other number of quite accurate, and highly flattering, terms.

Yes, but my client ignores mailing list managers which (erroneously)  
fiddle with the Reply-To header, so unless I remember (or change the  
default reply type for the list),  it decides to reply to the sender,  
and copy the list.
