<PRE>
&gt;&gt;<i> Wikipedia (and its syntax), thus a Medawiki-based place is an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> excellent way to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia is the only wiki that works AFAIK, and that is because it
</I>&gt;<i> has a huge amount of review. All other Wikis I have seen and used so
</I>&gt;<i> far have failed, and caused more confusion and misinformation than
</I>&gt;<i> actually give good information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I surf to jabber.org, I want to see a professional looking page
</I>&gt;<i> with 2 things:
</I>&gt;<i> - A 3-line explanation of what jabber is
</I>&gt;<i> - A button with &quot;Join now&quot;, which creates me an account on the Jabber
</I>&gt;<i> network by only asking me questions that I know the answer to (Name,
</I>&gt;<i> Email, Preferred login name)
</I>&gt;<i> What I do see is:
</I>&gt;<i> - A website that looks like a perpetual work in progress. Pretty
</I>&gt;<i> scary, doesn't really sound like a good IM service to me.
</I>&gt;<i> - About 50 links, many of which are uninteresting (the sidebar,
</I>&gt;<i> because it's a wiki)
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;Create account&quot; links that don't create a Jabber account
</I>&gt;<i> - Links to events that have passed, but nobody dares to touch the
</I>&gt;<i> front page, because nobody owns that page
</I>&gt;<i> - Links to things like 'discussion' that give me an error
</I>&gt;<i> - A quickstart guide that tells me to pick a server (a what? why?)
</I>&gt;<i> - A box saying that there have been GMail issues. When was that? This
</I>&gt;<i> morning? Last week? It seems this Jabber thing has lots of issues with
</I>&gt;<i> GMail, because it's been there for quite a while. (Why is it there?
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly, nobody dares to touch it)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Want me to go on? :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm not going to rant about Wikis anymore, this isn't helping.
</I>&gt;<i> I do believe that Peter's suggestion is a good one: one simple page to
</I>&gt;<i> get people hooked up with Jabber fast, that we can refer people to if
</I>&gt;<i> they want to chat on Jabber. One translator per language would be nice
</I>&gt;<i> to have the site translated, with a good system in place that notifies
</I>&gt;<i> of changes (which shouldn't happen often) to this page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1 now that I know who's the target.

On a more personal note, I can only agree with you. I seldom see Wikis
that actually work and to be honest Wikis layout and usability are rather
cumbersome but I digress :)
