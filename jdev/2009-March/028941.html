&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we all agree on the need for web-based registration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Web-based chatrooms are also great because they enable you to
</I>&gt;<i> participate and learn (e.g., join <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">help at muc.pt.jabber.org</A> and get
</I>&gt;<i> assistance in your native language)
</I>
But why? Why would someone go to jabber.org in the first place? Before you
even need help to move forward you need a reason to get there in the first
place. MSN didn't win over because it was better (I mean we all know how
dreadful it is at every level) but people had a reason to use it because
their relatives, loved ones, friends were using it. Regular people don't
care about making jabber.org a better place. They want to communicate but
they need a good reason to do so through it.

&gt;<i> without downloding a client.
</I>

Considering the term &quot;client&quot; means nothing for most common users it's a
good idea to avoid such term altogether. People use MSN or Skype... they
have no idea they use the &quot;MSN client application that connects to the MSN
servere&quot;. Jabber.org should probably have a webchat but I believe it
should also consider having its own client named just that &quot;Jabber&quot; (or
whatever foxy name that could trademark it). Even if it's just one of the
existing OSS one with a nice looking skin. Even if you talk about
browsers, people don't use a browser client, quite often they don't even
use Firefox, IE or Opera... they use the Internet.

&quot;client&quot; is a dev. term that has no concrete meaning for regular end user
IMO. Well perhaps we should experiment by asking our relatives. If I ask
my parents about &quot;client&quot;, they'll probably stare at me even though they
use many on a daily basis.
