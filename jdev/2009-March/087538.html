Well, we have 400,000+ users of the jabber.org IM service. Shutting down
the service seems unworkable. So the questions are:

1. Do we turn off registration for new users and redirect people elsewhere?

2. Do we leave the jabber.org service as basic IM but nothing more?

3. Do we try to deploy the kinds of services that are needed in order
for people to have a better experience? As far as I can see, those
services are SOCKS5 and TURN relays for file transfer and voice/video.
But we can't deploy just one of those (it would be overloaded) so we
need to deploy them more widely -- perhaps just Europe and North America
to start, but eventually in many locations so that people can use local
relays everywhere.

If we're going to do #3, then we'll have something that starts to look
like a free and open alternative to Skype. Perhaps it would not be
marketed as such, but it would be something like that in reality.
