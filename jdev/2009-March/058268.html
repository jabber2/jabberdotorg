Look, if we don't do it nobody will. Much as I like the folks who work
on services like Google Talk and Nimbuzz and SAPO (etc.), they need to
justify their services to people at their companies. That means they try
to funnel users to their domains. It's not in their interest to run an
open infrastructure for IM / file transfer / voice / video. Whether we
call it &quot;Jabber&quot; or &quot;FreeTalk&quot; or something else doesn't matter. (I
rather like &quot;FreeTalk&quot;, myself.) The point is that we have the chance to
federate with all those other services but also offer something more open.
