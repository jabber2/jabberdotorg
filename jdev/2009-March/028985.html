That's not possible: We'd need to call that client just &quot;Jabber&quot;, so  
the user is not confused. If the user downloads &quot;Jabber&quot; but then gets  
for example &quot;Psi&quot;, the user will be very confused.
But if we call a client &quot;Jabber&quot;, we can't just make another client  
the official one. The user will be very confused then, because now he  
got another application.

Now as we can't have clients competing about being the official Jabber  
client (for the beforementioned reasons), it would hurt all other  
clients.

&gt;<i> Ah, but ejabberd certainly derives a massive advantage by running the

</I>&gt;<i> other number of quite accurate, and highly flattering, terms.
</I>
Yes, and this has been criticized before as well :). It sure is an  
advantage for ejabberd, but not as much as an official client would be.

&gt;<i> Yes, but my client ignores mailing list managers which (erroneously)
</I>&gt;<i> fiddle with the Reply-To header, so unless I remember (or change the
</I>&gt;<i> default reply type for the list),  it decides to reply to the sender,
</I>&gt;<i> and copy the list.
</I>
Mine does something similar on many MLs: It sometimes doesn't include  
the ML at all&#8230;
