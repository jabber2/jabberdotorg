<PRE>After almost two years since the last release of mu-conference, here comes the 
new version. 

For those who don't know mu-conference, it is a XEP-0045 (Multi-Users Chat) 
component which can be used with any server. The implementation try to be as 
XEP-0045 compliant as possible.

This is mostly a bugfix version, a lot of bugs could cause mu-conference to 
crash. It also fixes two vulnerabilities in the mysql module. If your using 
this module, please update to this new version.

On a side note, i'd really like to thank Mark Doliner for all the patches he 
send for mu-conference.

Enjoy the release.
