<PRE>As posted at my blog....

I have this vision for jabber.org services:

   1. A clean and simple website with minimal text that will help end
users get started with Jabber.

   2. Web chat for a real-time window into one end-user chatroom and one
developer chatroom (and perhaps one additional room, such as a
language-specific or country-specific room).

   3. Internationalized versions of everything so that volunteers around
the world can run sites like de.jabber.org (Germany) and pt.jabber.org
(Portugal).

   4. Extension of this international model to XMPP services, so that we
can run SOCKS5 data proxies for file transfer and TURN media relays for
voice+video all over the world (we'll need to convince companies and
ISPs and non-profit organizations that this is in their interest, since
they are the people with the bandwidth).

For me the idea here is that jabber.org will be the community-driven
&quot;running code&quot; laboratory for the formal &quot;rough consensus&quot; technologies
produced by the XMPP Standards Foundation. The goal is to build an open
and distributed IM, presence, data, and VoIP service that can provide a
realistic alternative to closed systems like Skype.

None of this would be exclusive. We'd still strongly encourage people to
run their own XMPP services and join the network. But we'd also work
hard to have worldwide coverage under the jabber.org banner.

Call this &quot;Jabber 2.0&quot; if you must. In any case, I think it's time for a
strong community centered at jabber.org to provide technology leadership
in the communication space and thus help us all achieve the original
mission that Jeremie Miller set out long ago: freedom of conversation.
