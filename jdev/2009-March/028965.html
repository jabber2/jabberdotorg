Interesting. I had never quite thought about it this way before. I
agree. The problem though is that it is the ideal. What we currently
have is far from ideal, because we still have to serve these thousands
of users who simply type &quot;Jabber&quot; into Google.

The ideal is that operating systems will come pre-installed with
clients, and that ISPs will be hosting servers. The former is already
achieved in 2 major operating systems, the latter has been achieved in
at least one case. Still a long way to go though.

</I>&gt;<i> other, as is the case with Skype, MSN, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, I can't wait :)

&gt;<i> The big question of all is whether it is the job of jabber.org to compete with

</I>&gt;<i> jabber.org is truly competitive, and no longer a self-defeating reference
</I>&gt;<i> service, is it still fair to use the &quot;Jabber&quot; name? &#160;Peter, you may remember,
</I>&gt;<i> one of the options we discussed was to actually get rid of jabber.org
</I>&gt;<i> entirely. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>

Well by using the &quot;Jabber&quot; name we no doubt bring upon ourselves
responsibilities associated with doing so. This includes being a
reference service (on XMPP) and inevitably a kind of hub site for the
network in general (on HTTP). If we were to disband jabber.org I think
it would set adoption back quite some way, confuse users and leave
them with nowhere &quot;official&quot;-looking to turn to. (Not that we're
&quot;official&quot;-looking right now, but I'm hoping that's to change).

I had told myself not to reply to this thread, but your post at least
stood out as something worth thinking about :)

Matthew.
