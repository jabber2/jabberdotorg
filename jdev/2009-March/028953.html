Right. It is all about marketing. It would help (not for my sister) if
we easy MSN/AIM/ICQ integration (gateway) in the servers and an EASY way
to provide the credentials. That makes switching painless for everything
except Skype (&quot;You can still talk to your friends&quot;).

Take a look at the Skype website: it is presented in German for me (I
giess based on the IP address), a big photo (makes no sense, but it
looks like web 2.0), and a button &quot;download&quot;. I guess that is what we
need. The download would be a problem:

1. Do not let the user choose between x clients. Jabber.org should have
   one default client for Windows/MAC users (Linux users are grown up,
   they already know how to choose stuff).

2. The client must have Jingle support incl. Video

3. Userfriendly setup. E.g. a wizzard asking me if I already have an
   account or if one should be created. It has to include a list of XMPP
   servers for the user to choose. The list should be short.

4. The client must be able to auto-update itself. Users do not check for
   new versions, the software has to do that.

World domination is a slow process. :)
