I just realized that I literally rolled up my sleeves as I prepared to
answer this. I hope that is a good sign.

The documentation (including source code) probably does have a prayer
of helping, but it likely is a complicated ritual prayer that
encompasses several days of channeling spirits of the long gone
original authors, drinking lots of organic fair trade tea or coffee,
and giving up any hope of getting out to the store for an iPhone soon.

OTOH, I've started puttering with a little project of my own that will
require Google Talk, and I didn't know that there was an issue. So I
guess this is now on my list of things to do (or delegate, if anyone
else is willing).

Let's work off list on this. If anyone else is interested, please let
me know and I can add you to the addressees.
