It is not a full SIP client implementation. It's like creating AJAX
Jabber client -- HTML is implemented (as the interface between Jabber
and the web browser), but that doesn't make it a web browser or a
fully-featured web server.

I was thinking about that as a way to include voice messaging to my
console client -- I don't want to add codecs and voice-related
functionality to it -- it is already well done in sip clients, like
Ekiga -- I would just route the voice media to Ekiga... or a hardware IP
phone -- can you imagine a better user interface to voice messaging than
a physical telephone handset? Such hardware is available and 'talks'
SIP, why shouldn't we use that?

Greets,
        Jacek
