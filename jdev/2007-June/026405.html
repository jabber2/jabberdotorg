Well escaping will mostly be done by transports. Consider the case of 
the well known msn transport:
MSN has addresses of the form <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at domain</A> as well. So the transport when 
it maps this address to a Jabber ID it has to do something with the @ 
sign in this address. Traditional transports did map it to the % 
character. While a transport using XEP-0106 would map it to: 
user\<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">40domain at msn.example.com.</A>

Clients will normally not unescape this address when displaying it. It 
would only be unescaped by the client, if this client would have a 
different interface for MSN messaging (a multi-IM like GUI hiding the 
details that all is routed over the Jabber network for example), where 
it will then just display the <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at domain</A> again.

But no Jabber client always tried to display the JIDs generated by the 
msn transport as &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at domain</A>@msn.example.com&quot;.

&gt;<i> One possible question is: user's client during registration process.
</I>&gt;<i> And user will be surprised looking at his new brand escaped JID.
</I>
Why would a client do escaping during registration? It should just not 
allow the user to enter characters not allowed in the node part of a JID 
when asking it which account it wants to create.

Remember that this XEP is not made to allow new characters to be used in 
user names, but to define a possible way to map addresses, that cannot 
be mapped directly. I gave you one example with XML, another one is in 
URLs when you add parameter values to it (http GET request).

<A HREF="http://example.com/script.php?param=user%40domain">http://example.com/script.php?param=user%40domain</A>

You would also not expect your web browser to display this unescaped in 
the address line. This escaping is just there to be able to transport 
the @ character in value of a request.

The same way XEP-0106 is not about allowing nice new characters and 
displaying them animated in high color and blinking. It is just for the 
case a character has to be transported and cannot be used directly. Any 
use of escaping should be avoided when possible, you only do it if you 
have to.
