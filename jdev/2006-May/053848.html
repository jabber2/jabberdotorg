(some blurb first, skip down if you want the comment related to the
previous post)

There have been some ideas thrown in my direction by a friend about
creating a jabber-2-jabber transport that would function as a sort of
hatrack (hatrack = Hyper Availability TRAnsport Connection Kit) -
basically it's a transport where you can register all your other jid's
so you only have to login to your main server, with your primary jid,
and all the other accounts come online automagically.  In other words,
clients that don't support multiple jid's get it for free, via the
transport.

Now there are a few extra considerations here, the primary one being,
how do you sync your rosters?  Typically transports are used to
connect to *legacy* networks.  Some of these have the concept of
'groups', so JEP's like 0144 (Roster Item Exchange - rosterx) were
created.

As it happens the JEP only gives examples of legacy --&gt; xmpp contact
information.  It doesn't explicitly cater for communicating the group
changes *back* to the transport.

So for example if someone registers with a transport (msn,aim,icq,
afaik yahoo is the only one that implements rosterx), and gets their
groups via rosterx (if they're lucky that their client support is) -
the group information only flows: legacy --&gt; xmpp.  If they change the
group the contact is a member of, then the legacy network doesn't here
about it.  (Should it? - that's surely up to the user to decide, but
atm we can't tell the legacy network in any way).

This becomes more obvious with the jabber-transport, xmpp-transport,
hatrack (what ever you want to call it), because there are xmpp
semantics on _both_ sides.

Now obviously rosterx could be extended to handle group information
flow back to the transport (if the user so desires, and the transport
can handle it), but:

USEFUL IDEAS:

Rosterx can be used to support incremental /local/ roster updates too!

You still need the magic opaque integer (dns does this to remember)
but the list of changes could be sent in rosterx format. (provides
add,remove,update - remove the from address, and it defaults to the
server, brilliant)

So combine JEP-0150 with JEP-0144!

i.e. When server receives iq/query/jabber:iq:roster, with If-None-Match shim.
then query client disco#info for rosterx, and if it supports it then
deliver rosterx messages, otherwise spam roster.  (an alternative
would be to put a rosterx tag into the iq/query/jabber:iq:roster -
yuck)
