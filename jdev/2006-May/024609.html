This list is for end users of Jabber clients. You probably meant to post
it to the developers list (which I'm cc'ing):

</I>
What do you mean by &quot;handshaking&quot;?

You don't need a packet sniffer to see the XMPP traffic, just run the
right kind of client in debug mode and watch the XML fly by.

&gt;<i> My initial high level thoughts are to 'turn off' negotiation for voice and
</I>&gt;<i> video. 
</I>
That's a client thing, not a server thing.

&gt;<i> I notice 'Keep_Alives' is a client option that could be turned off. i
</I>&gt;<i> know there are proprietry lightweight LAN chat apps but I want to keep to
</I>&gt;<i> open source standards, ie Jabber. 
</I>
See below.

&gt;<i> Is there provision for 'pipe-lining'
</I>&gt;<i> multiple xmpp commands (ie similar to what is proposed for SMTP with
</I>&gt;<i> Pipelining (RFC-2197) - basically sending several commands at once and
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for the respective ACKs to return in 1 packet).
</I>
You can send multiple XMPP stanzas at once -- it's asynchronous.

&gt;<i> Also can Jabber be set for a UDP connection instead of TCP? The standard
</I>&gt;<i> (RFC-3920) implies TCP but doesn't explicitly rule out UDP, but this forum
</I>&gt;<i> reply does!
</I>
There is no UDP binding for XMPP, but there is an HTTP binding:

<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0124.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0124.html</A>

It's possible that we might define a UDP binding at some point, but it's
not a high priority for me.

&gt;<i> I see Jingle is looking at RTP over UDP. 
</I>
Jingle is transport-agnostic. Another transport for Jingle is IAX2
(Asterisk), and more transports may be on the way.

&gt;<i> I'm new to all of this but I see
</I>&gt;<i> there are &lt;transport&gt; commands. I'm currently evaluating Wildfire-2.6.2 and
</I>&gt;<i> they aren't any configuration options for UDP. IANA reserves xmpp port 5222
</I>&gt;<i> for TCP and UDP. Could this be possible with access to the client and/or
</I>&gt;<i> server source codes?
</I>
You could hack the source code from your server of choice to support a
UDP binding, but we'd prefer to define the protocol first (or concurrently).

&gt;<i> And one more qu... can Jabber talk client to client, or client to client
</I>&gt;<i> after the server goes down. Initial testing shows that once the server is
</I>&gt;<i> gone so does any client to client chat (basically it is relayed through the
</I>&gt;<i> server)
</I>
Yes, it can: <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0174.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0174.html</A>
