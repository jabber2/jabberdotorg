Currently yes.  Its also using the venerable Jabber::Connection library.

&gt;<i> Phycon (a buddy of mine) talks [2] about XMPP transports as 'hat

Huh.  Thats actually quite cool overloading the '^' character to seperate 
the destination JID from the proxied JID.  Putting on my security hat 
though, it exposes the proxied JID to view in the routing information, 
which is not good if you are running over a hostile network.  This can be 
worked around by also allowing an internal gateway identifier.

Ok, one new version of xmppgateway coming up.
