<PRE>Hi Bruce!

The s2s component in jabberd 1.4.4 will merely ignore the &quot;.&quot; entry. It 
will try to finde a A record for &quot;.&quot; and as this does not resolve skip 
to the next resolved entry, if there are entries with lower priority for 
the same service.
jabberd 1.4.4 will NOT try to resolve &quot;example.com&quot; after it found a 
_xmpp-server._tcp.example.com record. - Doesn't matter if one of the 
result records contained a &quot;.&quot; or not. If there has been a 
_xmpp-server._tcp.example.com record, there are no further tries. If 
there is no _xmpp-server._tcp.example.com record, it will try 
_jabber._tcp.example.com - and if there is also no such record, it will 
fall back to example.com.
Other service names are not tried by default, but can be configured - 
with the exception, that you cannot distinguish between _pres for 
&lt;presence/&gt; and _im for &lt;message/&gt;.

Therefore I'd say jabberd 1.4.4 works like it should in most of the 
cases, even if there is a &quot;SRV 0 0 0 .&quot; record - which will result in 
jabberd 1.4.4 stopping further DNS resolution.

Just in the case, that there is something like the following in DNS, 
jabberd 1.4.4 would be wrong (but I think this example is of academic 
nature, and can hardly imagine, that this could be really used in DNS):

_xmpp-server._tcp.example.com 3600 SRV 5 0 0 .
_xmpp-server._tcp.example.com 3600 SRV 10 0 5269 s2s.example.com

In that case jabberd 1.4.4 would contact s2s.example.com on port 5269 - 
while it shouldn't.

</I>&gt;<i>     ( after all, there wasn't anything with an address resulting
</I>&gt;<i>       from the first lookup ).
</I>&gt;<i>  or
</I>&gt;<i>     'fallback to looking up &quot;_jabber.example.com.&quot;'
</I>&gt;<i>     ( the &quot;I haven't read XMPP-IM&quot; response ;) )
</I>&gt;<i>  or
</I>&gt;<i>     'stop attempting to look up SRV records and fallback to looking
</I>&gt;<i>      up A/AAAA for &quot;example.com&quot;'

</I>&gt;<i> Various giggle searches on this topic haven't really answered the
