Something that struck me over the course of today, is that although a 
(sole) target of '.' means 'not available', and imho, 'stop completely', 
it could be argued that since XMPP-IM encourages SRV lookup chains, it 
might be permissible to continue with looking up 
_im._xmpp.example.com/_pres._xmpp.example.com , depending on whether you 
view generic server-to-server XMPP as being different from 
message-or-presence-server-to-server XMPP.

&gt;<i> Definitely it's wrong to resolve example.com and try randomly connecting to

</I>&gt;<i> there is no such service at the domain.

Agreed, but enforcement is another matter.
