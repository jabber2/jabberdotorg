You don't seem to understand. Every stanza contains information where it
should go. So there is no need for such information.

&gt;<i> (2) for connection oriented protocol like TCP, openning a connection for a

</I>&gt;<i> a bad idea, because TCP maintains states (ties up resources) on both ends...
</I>
Yes, a little bit. However, with moth machines behind a NAT today, do
you have any better idea how to be able to send them data whenever it is
needed? And, besides, closing the connection means changing the state to
offline.

&gt;<i> (3) what if system crashes or the connection resets?
</I>
Yes, then go offline and act as if just disconnected.

&gt;<i> The other potential issue has to do what the big environment...
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If other XML apps assume every message is a well-formed document (like

</I>&gt;<i> likely have to live with that, hindering adoption...
</I>
Well, this is XMPP protocol. If an application knows the protocol, it
knows they are not whole XML documents. If it does not know XMPP, it is
not much they could do even if they were documents.

&gt;<i> 2. In the future, XML capability will get built into the network layer, but 
</I>&gt;<i> if a message is not well-formed
</I>&gt;<i> XML, they are less likely to take advantage of those capabilities of 
</I>&gt;<i> network routers and switches, again
</I>&gt;<i> hindering adoption....
</I>
Into what network layer? I guess this will not happen. I really want to
see usable switch that understands XML.

And XMPP can still live nicely as TCP protocol. As is HTTP, as are many
others, it is only different what runs on the wire.

It seems you just misunderstand it completely. Could you read the
specifications?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Heh, I chatted with Tim Bray about this at a conference a few years ago

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Why is XMPP this way??
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Because. :P
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;But it turns out that streaming XML has some inherent benefits, one of

Work with computer has 2 phases. First, computer waits for the user to tell it what 
to do, then the user waits for the computer to do it. Therefore, computer work 
consists mostly of waiting.
