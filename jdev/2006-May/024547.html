&gt;<i> Yes.  It is a feature, after all.

As features go though, it's pretty weak - there are a number of problems
with it. 

The main use case which it seems to be addressing is, &quot;a user wants to
send an IM to the server admin&quot;, which is great - but this isn't a
strong way to do that. None of the users I know, including myself, would
send a message to &quot;jabber.org&quot; in an attempt to get to Peter.

Now a good case for &quot;Get a list of server administrators via Disco&quot;
could be made, especially if it was built into the clients, thereby
allowing users to actually use it. As it sits now, it's just not too
effective a server feature.

I'm going to implement this as it's described (one more item on that
list to check off, and it's only going to take an hour or two), but I'm
not comfortably enough with it to leave it enabled by default on
installation - or even to query during the install process to see if it
should be enabled. 

There are a number of other more advanced features implied here as well
- what if the server has Chinese Walls implemented (as a number of
commercial servers do), and the user is on one side of the wall and the
admins are on the other. Should the message be delivered? How is it
logged for auditing?
