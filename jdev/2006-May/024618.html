Hi Christian,

  One solution for this would be to invoke stream.process() when you are 
sure there is some data available.
Like , if you are using some producer-consumer model , or if you are 
using java's nio package.
With the former , it becomes as simple as just triggering a 
stream.process() as soon as you have produced some data.
With the latter , you will need to use async io and register your 
channel with a selector for read events - which will get notified when 
there is data available to be read.

With your current approach , if your underlying socket is blocking 
socket , then you need to worry about cpu usage in an infinite loop - it 
will block until there is data available : with caveat that you will 
have one thread per component session.
If you use nio , the only advantage is that you will be able to listen 
for read events from multiple streams simultaneously.

Not sure if I am answering your question properly enough ...

Regards,
Mridul
