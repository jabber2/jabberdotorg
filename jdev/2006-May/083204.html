<PRE>Hi. Thanks for the replies. Must say I'm pleased at the high level and
promptness of replies in the Jabber community. This post is on the jdev post
at Peter's insistence but I'm not a xmpp programmer and my expertise is in
the lower OSI levels - ie using applications over IP over RF layers. So
excuse some of my *silly* questions. But I am willing to 'tweak'...a little
knowledge is dangerous?!

First of all I cant see this message on the Gname list - only the JSF. NNTP
isn't enabled on the corporate network. Through JSF I cant simply reply to a
post like on other mail lists - I have to cut and paste from the website and
send an email to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jdev at .</A> Not sure if I'm doing something wrong.

Handshaking is the negotiation process of a protocol eg TCP 3-way handshake,
SYN, SYN ACK, ACK. Maybe not the correct term for xmpp but I meant the
process of negotiation with xml stanzas. Basically the to-ing and fro-ing of
commands is the major time delay for a high latency network. A 60 byte OK to
a command takes as long as several pipelined commands and the message. Text
chat will not consume a lot of bandwidth so the latency is the issue and
reducing the 'chattiness' or 'verboseness' is a priority (for me).

The JEPs I'm happy with and understand what they are stating. What I don't
know is how do I get a client and server to support these JEPs? Do I have to
wait for a newer client/server version that supports this, or add a
'plug-in', or do I have to edit existing clients/servers to handle the
additional JEP requests.

*	You can send multiple XMPP stanzas at once -- it's asynchronous.

How do I do this. Is this a matter of editing C/S source code?

As a note I have to say that whatever is used will have to comply with
standards so developing a solution for Group A can only be done to a level
complying with standards. So when new Subgroup B decide to join the existing
Group A chat all they need to do is get JabberClient version x.y.z which
JEP-xxxx and JEP-yyyy. It has to be interoperable.

Ennova2005 - is there an open source app/protocol for the (possible) server
side assist and/or the wire protocol given the interoperable considerations
above? And if it is to be used over a wireless mobile network?

*	There is no UDP binding for XMPP, but there is an HTTP binding:

I will look into this but since HTTP will still need to run over TCP it wont
get over the initial TCP handshaking latency. Since looking at the packets
in detail (or the xml window) it does not appear to be so much of an issue.
With client 'keep-alive' turned off the connection is silent until a message
is sent. There are other areas I want to look at like the presence updates
and concatenating the XMPP stanzas. 

Many thanks to all again - bit of reading up to do now! Cheers David

One level of indirection may solve many of your problems.

You probably want to run this client with some server side assist using a
proxy server. The proxy server will sit on the higher bandwidth/remote end
of your slow speed connection and mediate the communication with the XMPP
server.

Given the constraints on the bandwidth and latency, you may also be better
served by a simpler wire protocol between your device and the proxy instead
of the more verbose XMPP protocol. Your proxy will still use XMPP over TCP
to talk to the XMPP server but you could implement more of a 'state transfer
approach' between your client and the proxy with the proxy doing most of the
heavy lifting and data set reduction.

On the datarate issue - Many moons ago we developed an IM client for Mobitex
( the original blackberry network) that used a paging protocol. As I recall,
more than messaging, what caused the most traffic was presence updates from
every one on the contact list- which a server side proxy can help manage by
filtering.

What do you mean by &quot;handshaking&quot;?

You don't need a packet sniffer to see the XMPP traffic, just run the
right kind of client in debug mode and watch the XML fly by.

&gt;<i> My initial high level thoughts are to 'turn off' negotiation for voice and

</I>
That's a client thing, not a server thing.

&gt;<i> I notice 'Keep_Alives' is a client option that could be turned off. i

See below.

&gt;<i> Is there provision for 'pipe-lining'

</I>
You can send multiple XMPP stanzas at once -- it's asynchronous.

&gt;<i> Also can Jabber be set for a UDP connection instead of TCP? The standard

</I>&gt;<i> reply does!
</I>
There is no UDP binding for XMPP, but there is an HTTP binding:

<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0124.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0124.html</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0124.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0124.html</A>&gt; 

It's possible that we might define a UDP binding at some point, but it's
not a high priority for me.

&gt;<i> I see Jingle is looking at RTP over UDP. 
</I>
Jingle is transport-agnostic. Another transport for Jingle is IAX2
(Asterisk), and more transports may be on the way.

&gt;<i> I'm new to all of this but I see
</I>&gt;<i> there are  commands. I'm currently evaluating Wildfire-2.6.2 and
</I>&gt;<i> they aren't any configuration options for UDP. IANA reserves xmpp port
</I>5222
&gt;<i> for TCP and UDP. Could this be possible with access to the client and/or
</I>&gt;<i> server source codes?
</I>
You could hack the source code from your server of choice to support a
UDP binding, but we'd prefer to define the protocol first (or concurrently).

&gt;<i> And one more qu... can Jabber talk client to client, or client to client
</I>&gt;<i> after the server goes down. Initial testing shows that once the server is

</I>
Yes, it can: <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0174.html">http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0174.html</A>
