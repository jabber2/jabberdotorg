Clients provide a GUI where you enter the message and press Send, and that's 
all you need to do.  For example, Psi does this for broadcast addresses such 
as example.com/announce/online, the user doesn't need to know the actual 
address (although with this particular implementation, they can see it and 
remember it for the future.)

&gt;<i> I'm going to implement this as it's described (one more item on that

As a server admin who used to have himself listed as a &lt;read&gt; admin under 
jabberd 1.4.4, I can vouch that the vast majority of messages that do come to 
this special address are useless.  Most of the messages tend to be someone 
answering the automated welcome message, thinking that it was smart (just 
guessing.)

I think the full implementation of that JEP, supporting the multitude of 
different address types, is definitely the way to go.  That way in the 
client, I can just go &quot;Report Abuse&quot;, send the message and continue chatting.  
It would also be less likely for someone to accidentally send a message to an 
address like example.com/abuse.
