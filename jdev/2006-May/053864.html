As mentioned last Friday, we discovered a backdoor on the webserver
machine, as a result of which large volumes of spam were being generated
(resulting, among other things, in 60,000+ error messages in my inbox,
which I can tell you Thunderbird did not like!). We shut that down and
cleaned the box, but have not yet re-enabled many of the project
websites, since some of them were using PHP (e.g., PMWiki, installation
of which was not authorized) and the planting of the backdoor seems to
have been caused by a PHP vulnerability.

&lt;rant&gt;

In general, I have to say that I am sick and tired of JabberStudio. If
we could host it on a different box (not tied to other JSF services in
any way) and I could find someone else to maintain it, then I would be
less annoyed. At this point I would just as soon point developers to
other project hosting options out there (Savannah, SourceForge, etc.)
and shut down JabberStudio, because it is one big unmaintained PITA. Not
that JabberStudio is mine to shut down since the domain is owned by
Thomas Muldowney and Ryan Eatmon...

&lt;/rant&gt;
