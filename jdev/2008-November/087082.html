<PRE>Hi!
I am not sure this message is appropriate for this mailing list but I
thought I should try and one of the members told me to as well... so, I did
it!

Notifixious aims to be a notification platform. Basically, we want to &quot;sync&quot;
back the web and its users. I love someone's blog : I want to receive
immediate updates on my AIM when a new article has been published. I also
want to know immediately on my cell-phone when someone replies to a comment
that I left on a blog, or I want to receive an email when there is a new car
that corresponds to what I am looking for on Craigslist.

We want to be able to notify our users on the broadest set of channels
possible (basically on any channel they might use : Text Message, Skype,
MSN, Fax, but also Nabaztag, iPhone.... any!). This means that we had to
release an API that anyone could use to create interfaces for channels that
we don't support internally. For this we created an API based on PubSub and
XMPP that allows developers to &quot;create&quot; channels through which users can
subscribe and then receive updates.

We released this API this week and I wanted to have your feedback about
it... do you think it's useful, what would you improve or change.. etc! For
now it's a 'read-only' API since clients cannot subscribe or publish items
through this API, but we're working on it!

If you want to know more, please check this :

Also, we have released a 'firehose' of all notifications that transit
through our service, so you can already start using the API with it!

Thanks a lot for your time!

Julien
