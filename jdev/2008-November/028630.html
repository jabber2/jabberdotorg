</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The inbound item picked up off the queue could also be used to

Of the top of my head I don't see any out-of-the-box solution for what  
you want.

I would build a pub-sub-like component (reuse the parts of XEP-0060  
that you need), and implement the broadcast myself. You should split  
the destination list in chunks and have a XMPP worker component deal  
with each chunk.

Try and make sure that S2S connections are ready before you start  
broadcasting (ping or disco#info the remote server before you send  
them messages). This should cut a bit on S2S buffering or even dropped  
messages (depends on server).

Make use of component load-balancing built in ejabberd, XCP. If your  
server does not support this, take a look at a recent load balancing  
proxy written in Python/Wokkel. There was a C version of the same  
concept but I failed to find the link right now.

Building large multicast systems over XMPP right now is complicated if  
you use federation. Large sites like GTalk, Jabber.org and others will  
end up receiving large bursts of messages from you and trigger rate- 
limits, so the end user experience might suffer. Assume that you'll  
have to provide local accounts for users who require QOS.

Apart from that, have the appropriate amount of fun.

Best regards,
