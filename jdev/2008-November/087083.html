<PRE>&gt;<i> I am sorry jack but that didnt make sense to me at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> what is split? what is sources? do I have to learn scons before I can
</I>&gt;<i> COMPILE libstrophe ? that doesnt sound like very easy to use and quick
</I>&gt;<i> to get started with.
</I>
If SCons is installed you just type &quot;scons&quot; and you're done, on either
linux or windows.  This is the first I've ever heard of someone
getting a crash in the installer or in scons.

Without scons, it is still easy to build.  Just ignore &quot;Split&quot;.  I
gave you the list of files that comprise both expat and strophe, as
well as the compiler defines that you need to set when you compile.
Surely you can make a blank project, drag the files listed into it,
set the compiler defines in the project options, and hit build.

&gt;<i> Would you like me to ignore all the other files (remove them from a
</I>&gt;<i> project and just include the ones you mention here?
</I>
Exactly.  I have no idea how to build every file in the expat library.
 Who knows what strange stuff that other stuff is for or what things
it depends on in order to build.

&gt;<i> I have installed scon somehow (using python's latest version as opposed
</I>&gt;<i> to ibm's pre installed version) but it still doesnt recognize the term
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;scon&quot; (something) when I type it on the command line.
</I>
The command is &quot;scons&quot; which I assume you did but typoed here.  You
need to add the place where you installed it to your path.  Try &quot;set
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Where\You\Put\Scons&quot; at the commandline.  Alternative
you can just run it by typing in the full path:

\Where\You\Put\Scons\scons.exe

jack.
