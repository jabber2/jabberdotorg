Real-time Communication dev-room and lounge have been confirmed[1] by
the FOSDEM admins

dev-room is on the Saturday, 4 February

How would you feel about making the second day of the XMPP summit into a
generic Free RTC summit, looking at things that are common to XMPP and
other projects, or having a Free-RTC summit in parallel with the XMPP
summit on both days?

Some possible topics for an RTC summit are TURN, WebRTC, TLS issues,
supporting more Free RTC packages, GSoC recruiting, all of these are
relevant to XMPP but also useful for SIP and other purposes.

I've recently set up the Free-RTC Announce mailing list for periodic
announcements about major initiatives in Free-RTC, the XMPP community is
welcome to use it too, the aim is to have only a few messages per month,
please subscribe[2] if you would like to receive such emails from time
to time.

We will try to have some discussion between different communities about
FOSDEM on the Free-RTC discussion list, it would also be a great place
to promote the XMPP summit if you are keen to encourage people beyond
the XMPP community to join in.

Regards,

Daniel
