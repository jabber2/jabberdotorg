<PRE>I did look at HTTP to see if there was a natural fit for a client not
being able to connect to a server.  But of course there isn't because
these errors assume that a connection has been made to the server, since
its the server that is sending the error codes back.

I only picked 502 because I just saw the &quot;Remote Server Error&quot; next to 
it in the JPG and figured that was good enough for me until the jabber 
community could come up with something better.

I don't think 404 works, that is what the server should send back when
the client requests a resource that doesn't exist.  

I'm not even actually sure if its correct to have one client send
another client back an error in an iq.  Already the server sends back
a 503 error if the iq was sent to someone who is not online.  So maybe
all iq errors should come from the server.  Perhaps the client that
is a recipient of the oob should send a different type of error message,
embedded in a &lt;iq type='result'... message.

Just to give you some background of what I'm trying to accomplish.
Obviously I'm working on file transport.  When a user wants to send
his buddy a file, his client starts a mini web server, creates a 
resource in the web server for the file and then sends the oob message.

If the recipient user okay's receiving of that file, then it tries
to connect to the sending person's computer.  If that connection fails
because they are behind different firewalls, etc, then I'd like to
sending client to know so that it can tell the user there was a problem
and ask the user if they want to put their file up on one of our servers
so that their buddy can download it from there instead.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Robert,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I poked Jer about the error messages, too. :) Again we might want to
</I>&gt;<i> look at RFC 2616 (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt</A>). Jer thought
</I>&gt;<i> 401 sounded right but 502 didn't. If the recipient can't 
</I>&gt;<i> connect to the
</I>&gt;<i> URL, wouldn't we use 404? Maybe I'm misunderstanding exactly what you
</I>&gt;<i> mean by that scenario.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> RFC 2616 defines 502 as follows....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ******
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 10.5.3 502 Bad Gateway
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid
</I>&gt;<i>    response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to
</I>&gt;<i>    fulfill the request.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ******
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to me we'd probably want to stick close to the IETF standards
</I>&gt;<i> here, which say that:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Response status codes beginning with the digit &quot;5&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> indicate cases in
</I>&gt;<i>    which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of
</I>&gt;<i>    performing the request. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that by this scenario you mean something closer to 404, or
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps 503.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Peter
