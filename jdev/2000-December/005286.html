Well, I guess you could add the filtering requirement on the server to
the cons ;-)

David Waite also mentioned something that made me think, but from a 
different angle: 

- capabilities/presence sending when the client loads a module e.g. 
whiteboard.

Considering this from the opposite angle - what if I have a modular client
and I load a whiteboard. Up to this point, I've not sent a filter iq-set, 
(taking your good suggestion) meaning I haven't wanted (and haven't received
because of the default DENY) any detailed capabilities info.

But now I want to know, however a pushed-presence is not going to be
forthcoming (unless my intended correspondent changes presence (too)).

So perhaps we need both presence-based and queryable capability info?
Query to be answered by the server? 

Just thinking out loud a bit. I had actually gone to bed, but had to 
write this down first before I forgot &lt;grin&gt;. 

Please kick me if my thoughts are based on shaky ground - I'm still
a newbie here :-)

Seconded. 

Another thing - it's a long while since I've been so intrigued by
such a wonderful technology. It really is food for thought (even if
some of my thoughts are duffo ;-) Thanks Jabber-folks!
