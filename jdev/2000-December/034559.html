This is a nice approach. 

I'm looking at this presence/capability thing from this angle: 

I have e.g. 100 users in my roster. I connect to chat with one of them. 
I don't want a ton of stuff over the line telling me the other 99 can 
do XHTML, or do jingles, or can do MP3 streaming or whatevr ;-)

Then I want to find out who wants a game of Jabber-Hearts. At
/that/ moment I go to find out the capabilities, and a resource browser
would be ideal. I can get it when I want, with a simple query.

There is still the question of subscription, and the public/privacy 
thing. The 'anyone want a game of x?' only works if they 'submit' their
capabilities (whichever way) and say &quot;I'm OK with being queried on this
sort of thing&quot;. Then again, I can see spammers sending out 'anyone want a
game of *' to harvest as many jids as possible.

Data push is a powerful thing, and I think it's easy to misuse it, i.e.
to expect not to have to query data because I can get it pushed to me
without any effort. That's really what my concern is about, really.

cheers
