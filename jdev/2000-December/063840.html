Well, I guess we have to agree to disagree. Presence is presence. Not

It is just as inefficient to have every capability of clients (and today we
have relatively simple clients - I can't imagine all the features we might
have in the future) sent with presence messages, not counting the filtering
out again of this info when not needed.

Do you propose the client version should be sent in the presence too? That
means we can do away with the jabber:iq:version ;-)

These examples don't work in the current presence /subscription/ model, 
in that you won't get presence from strangers who might have 'Spanish',
for example, or new gamers who might be appropriate opponents.

This is not an easy debate, I know :-)
