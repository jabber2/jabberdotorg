&gt;<i> It is even more difficult: the client behind a resource could change,
</I>&gt;<i> and you wouldn't notice it.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, Feature negotiation has been discussed over and over again
</I>&gt;<i> in the past, but so far no usable solution has been found, AFAIK.
</I>&gt;<i> Re-polling every n seconds is no solution, either, obviously, as it
</I>&gt;<i> would cause tremondous network traffic...
</I>
  Agreed.  No one has come up with an adaquate solution as of yet..

&gt;<i> A possibility would be to requery on every presence change...
</I>&gt;<i> But even this does not solve all problems: you did not take into
</I>&gt;<i> account offline storage! If the user is offline, there is no way to
</I>&gt;<i> do feature negotiation. So, what to do then?
</I>
    Once again, as my mind meanders.  Why couldn't the server detect these?
The server will already know if the client changes.  Require the client send
an IQ setting it's capabilities to the server.  Then the server notifies
everyone of the new capabilities..

    And if one wanted to go one step further, the whole idea of XML style
sheets come into play.  If it was stated that all formated types needed an
XSL stylesheet, and we incorperated one into the server, couldn't the server
then reformat the information on the fly as needed?  Thus, I could be in
WinJab, viewing something via XHTML, but then later login to my Web client,
and have the server automatically display all my messages in HTML format,
running the messages thru the XSL stylesheet processor?
