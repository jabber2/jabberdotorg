&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have had 2 things on my mind for a while and would like to take the
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to hear from other people what they think would work and
</I>wouldn't
&gt;<i> work, or maybe come up with a better idea or implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first one concerns bandwidth vs horsepower. I think we can pretty
</I>safely
&gt;<i> assume that :
</I>&gt;<i> - in our own jabber server farm bandwidth is plentily available, and the
</I>only
&gt;<i> thing we are worried about is raw power of our servers. Any optimizations
</I>&gt;<i> would be ones that will get more messages routed in the same time, even if
</I>&gt;<i> that takes up a little more bandwidth inbetween jabber components (think
</I>of
&gt;<i> the main JSM to transports to xdb databases - all on a small LAN).
</I>
Sure - you can even put these machines on a separate network to increase
performance - this is one-time hardware costs.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - with regard to the &quot;outside&quot;, ie users connecting via TCP/IP over the
</I>&gt;<i> internet we value bandwidth much more. It is alright if the client has to
</I>do
&gt;<i> a little more work if it means it takes less bandwidth to get a message
</I>&gt;<i> across.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How to do this, without affecting jabber server code at all, and clients
</I>&gt;<i> minorly?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not bzip2 the xml stream? The client would simply stream through a
</I>bzip2
&gt;<i> function before sending it out over the socket, this would be quite easily
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in clients. On the server side, since any serious setup will
</I>use
&gt;<i> jpolld multiplexing machines only jpolld has to know about bzip2, when the
</I>&gt;<i> XML reaches the jabber server it is plain text XML again. Likewise, why
</I>not
&gt;<i> stream through an SSL component (with compression), once again, on the
</I>client
&gt;<i> side it would make no difference, on the server side the jpolld's could be
</I>&gt;<i> linked again an SSL library making use that hardware SSL acceleration
</I>board I
&gt;<i> see in every issue of LinuxJournal :-)
</I>
The first issue that may/probably will come up with this is that the packets
would have to be considered independant documents - otherwise you will have
a hold on a sent packet until enough additional data is sent to complete a
few more bytes of data.

The second issue is the same as with SSL - increased power needed by the
server. In the case of bzip2, a decompressing stream needs at least 1 MB of
memory (usually when you run bzip2 it will use about 9 MB for working
space). This would also be a requirement for working space while processing
a document - it wouldn't just be a 1 MB requirement per working thread. So
either you give a bit over a MB per working user (ouch), or restrict worker
threads from changing tasks until a packet is complete, and recognizing that
as a document (a major opening for DoS attacks).

Compared to both of these, a binary-representation of the protocol would be
a godsend :)
