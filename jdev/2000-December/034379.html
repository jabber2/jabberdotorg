<PRE>Of course, the reason it is 'feature negotiation' rather than a feature mask is
that different features are desirable in different circumstances. If there was
a Foo Text Markup Language, it is very possible that some traffic may be better
formed in it than in xhtml.  In the end, both would be required. Also, feature
sets may not be static throughout a client session (read: dynamically loadable
modules/plugin arch)

In what circumstances would feature negotiation not work due to presence? Am I
not correct in the assumption that even if another resource bumps an existing
one off due to name conflict, that the presence cycles to 'offline'? You also
can't change your resource without reauthenticating. In what circumstance would
you not know that a client has changed to a reduced featureset without having
them drop offline?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A possibility would be to requery on every presence change...
