<PRE>&gt;<i> looks a little bit like you have murdered the Community? I mean... no
</I>&gt;<i> diaries anymore? No logins? A pre selcted List of Projects and Core users? I
</I>&gt;<i> think this is a big problem. It doesn help if you put superlatives on the
</I>&gt;<i> web page about the Open Spirit if you close the Web page that way. Besides
</I>&gt;<i> this adds a lot of ork to the Web Admins, too.
</I>
Ahh don't worry, in an effort to push this out the door quickly we have just
slightly delayed the reimplementation of those features. We have not
forgotten and certainly already miss these features. I am waiting for some
back-end PHP module work to be completed before we can implement the users,
which would include the diaries and the ability to add and manage your
project.

We have *not* forgotten about these features and they are very, very high
on our todo list.

&gt;<i> So please hurry to get back a Slash style Announce/Comment System divided in
</I>&gt;<i> official News and inofficial Diaries.
</I>
Also waiting on users to be implemented.

&gt;<i> Is there a reason for removing the LightBulb Logo? I thought it was cool and
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of Projects catched up on that theme. It's a deadly Sinn to change the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Cooporate Design&quot; that way.
</I>
Nah, we haven't forgotten, just haven't found a place to put it yet. We'll
definitely put it back in in the next revision of the site.

Keep your eyes open over the next few days!

Justin
