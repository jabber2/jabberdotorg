<PRE>I've been thinking about putting together a CDROM of Jabber software, to
make available for a fairly small fee.  The CD would have all the open
source server and client software AND would include pre-built binaries of
everything, along with a few extras.  The intent here is to make an easy
package for someone to try out Jabber.  One target audience would be Linux
using programmers and sysadmins who have heard about Jabber and now want to
see if it fits their company's needs.  Given the number of messages I see on
JDEV regarding building the software, it sounds like a lot of people have
trouble compiling the server and transports.  So one value with this CD
would be that everything's pre-built.

Below is a list of what this &quot;Jabber Intro Pack&quot; (or you might call it the
&quot;Jabber Evangelist's Kit&quot;) might include.  I'd love to hear your thoughts in
a few different areas:  Do you think this would be useful in helping promote
Jabber?  What price seems reasonable?  What else would you want included if
you bought this?

You get...

ISO 9660 CDROM with:
	open source Jabber server
	open source transports (ICQ, AIM, Yahoo, and MSN)
	groupchat
	open source Jabber clients
	full source code for all the above
	prebuilt static binaries of the above--Linux 2.2 or Windows 2000
	example server config files

&quot;Introducing Jabber&quot; document in HTML or PDF, covering:
	installing your Jabber server
	configuring your Jabber server
	installing and using your Jabber client
	where to go for more information

Jabber t-shirt in M, L, XL, or XXL


What's the right price? $9.95, $24.95, or $34.95? (plus shipping)

I'd like to be able to at least break even on material and manufacturing
costs, and labor costs, too, if possible.


Todd.
