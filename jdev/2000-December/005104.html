<PRE>&gt;<i> RE: [JDEV] jabber users limit !!Still million $ question is how to configure
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; tune jabber to reach its maximum users limit (40,000) .
</I>
&gt;<i> users=1000
</I>&gt;<i> message_delay=1
</I>
umm, is that 1000 users sending one message every second??  *chuckle*

two things: 

1) to assume that every user will send a new message every second is nuts-
most people will have large blocks of idle in there.  i type very
quickly; i probably send an IM message at a clip of one every three
seconds at peak rate.  usually, though, i'm not donig that.  i'm usually
idle.

so as a basic metric, multiply your 1000 tested live users by three.  then
probably multiply that by 15 or so due to the amount of lag time in most
conversations.  i'd think differently if it was groupchat, but simple IM's
shouldn't be putting such a huge load on there.

2) 1000 database-backed operations in a second is absurdly fast.  temas is
a magician or a djinn or something to get a PIII/700 to be so pimp ;)
i'm thinking especially about the kind of performance you get out of an
apache server with a mysql backend;  its not that fast. :)


if you really need better performance than you're getting (and how do you
know without testing it?) you should probably be looking at bigger
hardware :) :) :)  *loves the hardware freakshow*

my guess would be that 40,000 users each sending one message every
second would probably eat several bonded 100BaseT connections to a *very*
large server or server farm...  if that's what you really need you
probably need a bigger box than anything wintel.  (i'm a solaris bigot,
personally; pick your scalable unix of choice)
