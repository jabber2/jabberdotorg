<PRE>Hey all..

So, to summarize the discussion..

The original discussion was all about trying to figure out how to encode
messages in a nice format -- that is, do we use XHTML for _all_ messages
or not. This mutated into talking about how to exchange capabilities which
is where we are now.

There are two basic camps for capability exchange:
1.) Embed capability in presence
      Pros:
      - Capability info is pushed on a per-resource basis -- you get it
      without having to ask for it
      - It is a fairly &quot;natural&quot; extension to presence since it gives more
      specifics about a particular resource
      
      Cons:
      - Information overload; some clients don't _want_ this information
      since they never use it
      
2.) Have a iq for requesting capability
      Pros:
      - Lazy evaluation; you only get information that you _really_ need.

      Cons:
      - Added architectural overhead; you have to use &lt;iq&gt; (which isn't bad,
      just more work)


Additional pros/cons of both would be welcome.

Personally, I'm still for having capabilities in the presence -- at least for
the moment. The question is, how do we have the server filter this for us?
Maybe we have a &lt;iq&gt; interface to the server to allow certain capabilities to
be filtered?

&lt;iq type='set'&gt;
      &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:capabilities'&gt;
            &lt;message-xhtml/&gt;
      &lt;/..&gt;
&lt;/..&gt;

That would let you tell the server which capabilities you wanted? If you _didn't_ specify, the server would strip out capabilities information (DENY by default). The problem with this approach is the added overhead which this places on the
server, since for each &lt;presence&gt; packet sent by someone, the server has to not
only relay it to you, but also check the packet and strip out the capabilities
you're not interested in. (Although this happens on _your_ server, not the one
which originated the &lt;presence&gt; packet, so we do benefit from the distributed
nature..)

As noted by some other people (Dave Waite, in particular) there is the general
issue of what to do with abitrary data embedded in &lt;presence&gt; packets. Should
the server protect users from this information? I believe this to be a 
foundational question that affects most future development. Indeed, this is one
of the caveats of having such a flexible, extensible architecture -- how do you
control/filter information that some people view as required?

I'm not sure at this point, what the best way to proceed is. To answer the 
question about &quot;rich text&quot;, I believe that by default we stick with plain text
in the &lt;body&gt; tag and stick a &quot;rich text&quot; in a seperate namespace -- this is
in keeping with the general minimalist philosophy upon which Jabber is based.

The more general question of _when_ to include &quot;rich text&quot; and doing it in an
intelligent manner requires more thought as it encompasses the general problem
of filtering unwanted data. For now, I would say that clients which support
&quot;rich text&quot; just send it on in the namespace.

One thing I must comment on is how proud I am to be apart of the Jabber 
community. It's great to take part in a discussion where even tho people 
disagree on a methodolgy, they still are able to carry on an intelligent 
conversation. It's a happy, happy thing. :)
