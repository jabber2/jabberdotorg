<PRE>    I have a Redhat linux server running on a mostly Windows network.  I
want to run the Jabber 1.2 server on the linux box to be used just in house
for IM.  I do not run DNS on the linux box since it has no connection to the
outside world.  Everything for the internet goes through a proxy and since
we run a mostly Windows network, we use WINS (yuck) inside.  I am not real
familiar with setting up a DNS server and don't know if I could even do it
since it would be just in house.
    My question is, do I need DNS for Jabber to work properly.  Right now
there is an entry in WINS that points everyone who calls intranet (name of
the server) to the linux box.  I installed the Jabber server and it seems to
be working alright.  I noticed its screaming every time a user joins up or
logs in (it is trying to get out to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">update at jabber.org</A>).  I killed the
version module and then the annouce also and it still won't shutup.  Jabber
stopped sending messages to each user after this so I put them back.  I went
to the logging section and just cut the stder off so at least it would not
flood the screen (only error.log).
    What would be the best way to set this up for just in house use?  Do I
need to setup DNS just to run in house?  Also, I want group chat and I went
to the CVS, followed the instructions.  Nothing.  Searched this mailing list
archive and followed DJ Adams instructions, config won't work at all then.
Is this a DNS related issue?  I hope that someone can point me in the right
direction....
