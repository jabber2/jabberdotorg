and modularity, instead of content itself.

    I don't believe that would ever happen for one simple reason.  Nearly
everyone agrees that the text based &lt;body&gt; tag should remain intact.  It
would never prevent you from having the conversation that way.  At the
lowest level, everyone must support sending in plain text.  If they decide
to supliment this with XHTML content, it should send BOTH specifically for
this reason.
