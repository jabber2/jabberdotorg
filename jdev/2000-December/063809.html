<PRE>I've been trying (unsucessfully) to get some transports compiled on a
solaris 7 (sparc) box.  Jabber itself compiled fine - with no problems.
However, when I attempt to install the aim or groupchat transport, I get...

checking for pth_init in -lpth... no
configure: error:
*************************************************************
*  You do not seem to have GNU pth installed on your system *
*  and this is preventing the completion of the make        *
*  process.  Please install GNU pth from:                   *
*  <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/pth">http://www.gnu.org/software/pth</A>                          *
*************************************************************

pth is installed and is detected and run by other packages.  Notably, apache
compiles against pth as does jabber itself.  I've double checked my
environment variables, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_RUN_PATH are both set
correctly.  At least everything else seems to compile okay.  libpth is in
/usr/local/lib.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/lib:/opt/OV/lib:/app/transition/mcc1600:/opt
/OV....
LD_RUN_PATH=&quot;/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib:/opt/local/lib:/opt/gn
ome...

Anyone have any ideas?  I'm trying to get jabber up and running as a
replacement for AOL AIM, which is pretty much used enterprise wide.  It's
been eating chuck of our inet bandwidth that a jabber server would seem to
ease up on.  (Allmost all of our IM's are internal).

As a side note, I've not done any heavy load testing on jabber.  I'm
considering setting up a single sparcstation (probably a sparc-2 (233 mhz,
192 meg ram) to handle all of our im needs.  We have about 16,000 potential
clients.  I'm guessing anywhere from 5 to 6k concurrent sessions at any
given time.  Of course, if the hardware's not enough, I can probably
convince those in charge to pitch in for a ultra 60 or 80 - but that's 13 to
16k of money that nobody (including myself) wants to spend - I'd rather
spend that money on training or a new management console ;)

Thanks guys.
