<PRE>Hi, as well as developing a client, my company is also
looking to run our own servers.  So, this debate about the
maimum user limit is very interesting to us.

We have pretty much 'bet the farm' on Jabber and are
commited to using it now after considering alternatives.

We have no problems investing in high-end server hardware
to run our Jabber servers, provided we can reliably sustain
a large amount of users with 24/7 uptime.

So, would it be possible to post the configuration of the
system that had 40K users, in as much detail as possible?

Also, what was the testing methodology?  How was 40K
users simulated? Has that ever been reached in a public system?

This would let people interested in the scalability of Jabber,
have a go at setting their own similar system to see if they
get similar numbers.

Thanks,

Ryszard

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RE: [JDEV] jabber users limit !!Still million $ question is how to configure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &amp; tune jabber to reach its maximum users limit (40,000) .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users=1000
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message_delay=1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> umm, is that 1000 users sending one message every second??  *chuckle*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> two things: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) to assume that every user will send a new message every second is nuts-
</I>&gt;<i> most people will have large blocks of idle in there.  i type very
</I>&gt;<i> quickly; i probably send an IM message at a clip of one every three
</I>&gt;<i> seconds at peak rate.  usually, though, i'm not donig that.  i'm usually
</I>&gt;<i> idle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so as a basic metric, multiply your 1000 tested live users by three.  then
</I>&gt;<i> probably multiply that by 15 or so due to the amount of lag time in most
</I>&gt;<i> conversations.  i'd think differently if it was groupchat, but simple IM's
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be putting such a huge load on there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) 1000 database-backed operations in a second is absurdly fast.  temas is
</I>&gt;<i> a magician or a djinn or something to get a PIII/700 to be so pimp ;)
</I>&gt;<i> i'm thinking especially about the kind of performance you get out of an
</I>&gt;<i> apache server with a mysql backend;  its not that fast. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if you really need better performance than you're getting (and how do you
</I>&gt;<i> know without testing it?) you should probably be looking at bigger
</I>&gt;<i> hardware :) :) :)  *loves the hardware freakshow*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> my guess would be that 40,000 users each sending one message every
</I>&gt;<i> second would probably eat several bonded 100BaseT connections to a *very*
</I>&gt;<i> large server or server farm...  if that's what you really need you
</I>&gt;<i> probably need a bigger box than anything wintel.  (i'm a solaris bigot,
</I>&gt;<i> personally; pick your scalable unix of choice)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
