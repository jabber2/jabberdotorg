	Apologies.  I tend to use Mozilla as my newsreader, hooking in to 
Gmane.org's NNTP feed for this mailing list.  Hadn't checked my email 
this weekend, so I missed your private emails.  Sorry about that.

	I will do as you suggest above.  Also, as you suggested in the private 
emails, I will

* update the sample jabber.xml file and post here when ready
* send the necessary Makefile changes to the respective module owners 
for JUD, MU-Conference, etc.
* read up on cvs diff -u (again, sorry for that.  Just haven't had much 
time to read up on diff.  I understand what it does; just need to get 
comfortable with the switches/etc.)

&gt;&gt;<i>By the way, I noticed your vote to *exclude* GNU Pth from the 1.4.3
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>distribution.  Is that the plan?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unless anybody comes up with a decent counter-argument, yes ;-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>For folks not altogether familiar with the Pth library, this exclusion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>might cause more grief.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabberd is the only piece of software I know that comes with the libraries
</I>&gt;<i> it needs. While I can understand that this is handy sometimes, I think it
</I>&gt;<i> causes several problems. For example, on better OS distributions the
</I>&gt;<i> libraries should be retrieved and updated from the OS's repository
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;apt-get install...&quot;, &quot;emerge...&quot;). Also, if you read the mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> archive, you see that admins often encounter problems due to pth being
</I>&gt;<i> compiled but not properly installed (&quot;pth.h not found&quot;).
</I>
	Point taken, and you're right.  OS repositories (even one as simple as 
Cygwin's setup.exe) are definitely better.  So no counter-argument from 
me. :-)  [Just have to add some instructions for Cygwin users, as Pth 
isn't installed nor available currently as a Cygwin package, and so will 
require a manual download/compile/install.  More to add to jabberd's WWW 
pages.]
