<PRE>Hi Frank, 

  Yes, i'm peregrine. That email address should work but i've not heard anything yet. Could you try one thing for me - if 
glib2 will compile under cygwin, can you try the cvs version of mu-conference. I know of some instability issues in the 
v0.5.x series, and this should have fixed them. I'm just unable to get cygwin running at the moment due to the download 
size.

Regards,

  David

</I>&gt;<i> however, Jabberd runs just fine.  I've had a server up for weeks at a

</I>&gt;<i> (usually due to security updates :-) ).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I just emailed peregrine, the listed owner of the MU-C
