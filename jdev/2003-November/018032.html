<PRE>David,

Ummm...unless I see it wrong, glib isn't one of Cygwin's available 
pre-built packages (<A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/packages/">http://www.cygwin.com/packages/</A>), which means I'd 
have to download it, compile it from source, etc.  This will have to 
wait 'til tomorrow (Wed) at the earliest, assuming I can find enough 
time.  And that's assuming I can GET glib2 to compile under Cygwin.

...uh oh, not sure if this is good or bad.  Just Google'd and found this:

	<A HREF="http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~s01397ms/cygwin/">http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~s01397ms/cygwin/</A>

Looks like patches exist to get glib2 to compile under Cygwin.  Wasn't 
counting on this level of joy. :-)  When it comes to patches, I'm still 
not terribly comfortable.  Last time I did major coding, we worked with 
straight text files.  No CVS, no diff, no patches in the manner in which 
it just seems assumed today that everyone knows.  I'm afraid I would 
fall under &quot;low-tech&quot; in this regard. :-/

If you don't mind walking me through it just a tad, I'll give it a whack.

By the way, does this mean that MU-Conference depends on glib2 now? 
That's basically new as of v0.6, isn't it?

Oh, and if you don't receive my email--sent around 1:PM EST to 
&lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jabber at pere.legend.uk.com</A>&gt;--please let me know so I can get that to you 
somehow.
