Think what you want to think. I don't care about P2P for video/audio
because it's simply not practicable in real world environments. Only the
most basic cases can be covered by P2P. 

To answer, the last time i had four people was days ago. We meet a lot
in voice channels, but right now i am in a processor pool with no sound,
so we can't meet that often. We work and play with voice enabled. 

The other mentioned approach with the tokens is not practicable at all.
It's simply nonsense. Or do you really want to build a token ring
network in the internet?
