<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; If I were initiating a conference (ie I was the server) and I lost my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection d*mn if the rest of the meeting can rattle on without my
</I>hearing
&gt;<i> &gt; it. It might be OK for Xbox but in a business environment it is very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important to have all members around all the time and especially the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Chairman!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As to bandwidth, unless I am missing something each peer needs to send
</I>out
&gt;<i> &gt; their audio to each member - 7 people means 6*7=42 streams out. With a
</I>sever
&gt;<i> &gt; you have 12 streams to the 6 clients - one out and a mixed one back
</I>(sans
&gt;<i> &gt; your own data).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree to 100%!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P2p simply not only doubles the traffic, it almost produces 4 times as
</I>&gt;<i> much traffic!
</I>
Yes it does increase traffic for each client but its nothing that broadband
connections cant handle and it avoids the major problem of a single point of
failure, also the stream calculation is wrong 6 people doesnt make 42
streams in each client (and mine is slightly wrong too looking back at my
reply, but nowhere near as wrong), if there are 6 people in a conversation
you will only be communicating with five other clients that makes 10 streams
total in and out, 5 in and 5 out, that makes for a bandwidth utilisation of
40kbps using a 8kbps voice codec, broadband connections can easily handle
this, and also as ive already said using silence detection you can take the
bandwidth requirements right down as not everyone will talk at once the
whole time.
