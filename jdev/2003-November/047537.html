<PRE>&gt;<i> There is no such requirment. The only difference is in handeling the XML.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than doing this P2P style (with no client taking the role of
</I>&gt;<i> server) on of the clients will have to play &quot;server&quot;. But ofcourse the
</I>&gt;<i> only thing it will &quot;serve&quot; is it's own audiostream, and the only client it
</I>&gt;<i> will serve is the other &quot;peer&quot;.
</I>
Doesnt this really mean than they are both servers each serving the other
its audio stream?? By definition that is P2P not client/server.

Peer &quot;To be, or to assume to be, equal&quot;.
<A HREF="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=peer">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=peer</A>

&gt;<i> However, supporting this will mean that
</I>&gt;<i> with the same spec and implementation you can also participate in
</I>&gt;<i> conferences! Wether those are hosted on a component or on another users
</I>&gt;<i> machine who has a more advanced client that supports mixing.
</I>
Im not saying that we cant design a protocol that will work both ways, that
is the only way we should design it IMO, but there is no need to define in
the protocol that it must be client/server, it should be generic, and
shouldnt restrict doing it still in a p2p fashion for more than two people,
as ive said there is no harm allowing conversations of more than 2 people
using p2p if the bandwidth is available to do it.

&gt;<i> Again, the only difference is in handeling the XML. Wich I think would
</I>&gt;<i> only be a bit different, not quite harder to do or more complex.
</I>
Of course.
