Maqi,

Hope it's ok that I post this updated info here, but figured anyone out 
there considering doing modules/plugins might care to know what I've 
discovered (though odds are you all knew this already).

In short, attached here are submissions for newly updated Makefiles for 
Jabberd v1.4.3, including a diff file--jabberd143.diff--generated with 
'cvs diff -u'...hope I did that right, and a tar/gz 
file--newMakes.tar.gz--containing the full Makefiles in case the diff 
file is no good.These Makefiles are much streamlined compared to my last 
submission, as I've learned that my hack was doing things &quot;the old way.&quot;

End result:

	* cleaner Makefiles--only differences between Cygwin build and
	  *nix build of dynamic libraries--beyond the file extension
	  .dll vs. .so respectively--is the compile line itself.

	* elimination on the dependence/need for ./cygwin/dllinit.c
	  (though I'd suggest leaving it in 1.4.3 just...in...case).

	* compiled modules that are 30-50% SMALLER than before (in
	  a few cases, over 50%)!!

I have set up two different Windows XP Pro boxes with Cygwin, built 
Jabberd 1.4.3 from CVS as of today (6Nov2003), and tested communications 
from 1-on-1 chat to JUD lookups to MU-Conference to s2s communications. 
  I even fired up a Jabber client which I connected to an account at 
Rhymbox.com, then chatted with myself via an account on one of the two 
servers.  Yeah, it's so bad I'm talking to myself...again. :-)

With this last submission (and respective submissions to the authors of 
JUD, MU-C, xdb_ldap, and xdb_sql), I think I'm finished.

____________________________________________________________
MORE DETAIL FOR THOSE SO INCLINED

[Rather long, so get caffeine or skip if not interested.]

I achieved my original hack using various information, including that on 
the Cygwin FAQ page at

	<A HREF="http://cygwin.com/faq/faq_4.html#SEC109">http://cygwin.com/faq/faq_4.html#SEC109</A>

As you can see, this page indicates it's out-of-date (though I don't 
recall seeing that message when I read it awhile ago).

The basic process was an ugly one, but it all revolves around the same 
fundamental principles involved when working on dynamic libraries. 
Typically, in order to build an application which relies on dynamic 
libraries, you write the main code and link in stub files (in *nix, 
these tend to be lib&lt;modulename&gt;.a files).  These stub files are to 
dynamic libraries what .h files are to .c files in many cases:  they 
provide the linker with enough information to resolve functions/etc. in 
your main code so that your program will link into an executable.  At 
runtime, the OS will then &quot;hook in&quot; the matching dynamic library (again, 
in *nix these tend to be lib&lt;modulename&gt;.so files), making the 
functionality of that library available to your running program.

However, dynamic libraries are built/handled differently by different 
OSes.  Since Jabberd was built &quot;the Unix way&quot;, let's look at that first. 
  When you compile a dynamic library in Linux, for example, a lot of the 
dirty work is done by gcc and ld.  For example, even though libraries 
must somehow &quot;export&quot; a list of functions/variables that are accessible 
to the calling program, you don't really have to do much as the 
programmer to make this happen.  You just type the appropriate gcc/ld 
switches on the command line, and magically all that is done for you.

Windows is not quite so elegant, howver, and when it comes to Cygwin and 
trying to build *nix style libraries under Windows, it gets messy. 
Windows calls these files Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), and their file 
extension is just that, &quot;.DLL&quot;.  That's a cosmetic difference.

OLD WAY

But up until the more recent net release of Cygwin, building such DLLs 
under Cygwin was a royal pain.  You had to manually build the DEFinition 
list of EXPORTed functions/etc., then take extra steps to basically 
&quot;wrap&quot; this information around your *nix dynamic library.  The procedure 
went something like this:

	* Create a .DEF text file containing the list of EXPORTed
	  functions a library offered.
	* run a special &quot;wrapper&quot; command which would wrap this
	  information around your library so that, when compiled into a
	  .DLL, it would work correctly.

The trick is, how do you build the .DEF file and what are the special 
commands?

The .DEF file is just a text file of the form
	____________________
	EXPORT
	function1
	function2
	...
	____________________

where the first line literally says &quot;EXPORT&quot;, and the functions/etc. the 
library offers are written one per line after that.  Often (as was done 
in Jabberd 1.4.2's Cygwin code), these .DEF files were made by hand, 
which gave the programmer control over what functions were &quot;visible&quot; 
outside the library (for you C++ types, this is similar to public vs. 
private methods).

However, a tool named 'nm' does exist in Cygwin which will automatically 
list all the symbols in given object files, letting you automate that 
step in the process.  But it does require organizing the output from 
'nm' to match what is expected in a .DEF file.

Next up is the tool which takes the .DEF file and object code, links 
everything together and builds the library.  This is 'dlltool'. 
However, to speed up the process, another tool exists called 'dllwrap' 
which uses 'dlltool' by default, saving you a bit of work.

As an example of how this works, here is the relevant portion of the 
Jabberd dialback module Makefile, as it was written by me originally so 
Jabberd compiled under Cygwin:
________________________________________
ifeq ($(__CYGWIN__),1)
	# Make .def file:
	echo EXPORTS &gt; dialback.def
	nm $(dialback_OBJECTS) $(PTHLIB) | grep '^........ [T] _' | \
		sed 's/[^_]*_//' | sort &gt;&gt; dialback.def
	dllwrap --def dialback.def --driver-name $(CC) -o dialback.dll\
		$(dialback_OBJECTS) ../jabberd/jabberd.a $(LDFLAGS) \
		$(LIBS)
else
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(MCFLAGS) -o dialback.so $(dialback_OBJECTS) \
		$(LDFLAGS) $(LIBS)
endif
________________________________________


NEW WAY

As it turns out, this is no longer necessary, as the gcc folks have 
added a wonderful switch called '-shared' that works under Cygwin just 
as it does elsewhere, allowing the creation of shared libraries to be 
much more painless.  Now, in short, the above can be reduced to just

________________________________________
ifeq ($(__CYGWIN__),1)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(MCFLAGS) -o dialback.dll $(dialback_OBJECTS) \
		../jabberd/jabberd.a $(LDFLAGS) $(LIBS)
else
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(MCFLAGS) -o dialback.so $(dialback_OBJECTS) \
		$(LDFLAGS) $(LIBS)
endif
________________________________________

NOTE:  Since &quot;MCFLAGS = -shared&quot; in ./platform-settings, we did not
        need to set that explicitly.  Otherwise we would have simply
        added that to the list of compiler switches.

Notice in the above revised section that the only difference, besides 
the file extension of the library, is one additional object called 
&quot;../jabberd/jabberd.a&quot;.  This brings us to the one crux in developing in 
Cygwin currently.

MAIN EXECUTABLES SHARING SYMBOLS

The 'jabberd.a' file looks like a stub file because it is.  However, 
there is no jabberd.so or jabberd.dll in the ./jabberd directory.  That 
'jabberd.a' file is actually a stub file for the main executable, 
'jabberd.exe'!  This is due to the modular/plugin nature of the Jabberd 
program.

When you think of how Jabberd works, with the various modules like jsm 
and dialback hooked into the main server via the jabber.xml 
configuration file, it becomes clear that the server process &quot;hooks 
into&quot; the modules.  This is how it is with most dynamic libraries. 
However, unlike more common coding, there are also times when the 
modules interact with the server processes functions/variables, and this 
requires that the modules can &quot;see&quot; the executables symbols just as the 
executable can see theirs.  [Think Netscape/Mozilla with plugins, for 
example.]

In *nix this isn't much of an issue, as compiling an executable and 
exporting its symbols takes no more effort than doing so with libraries. 
  Unfortunately, at least at this point, 'ld' under Cygwin doesn't work 
that way.  It seems that you can EITHER

	1. build an executable, or
	2. build a shared library with its matching .a stub file.

You cannot do both.

If you try to pass linker options on the compiler line as you might in 
*nix, attempting to build an executable AND a stub file, things just 
don't work right.

$(CC) -shared -o library.dll -Wl,--out-implib,liblibrary.dll.a

is the usual way to build a library and matching stub, and this works. 
However,

$(CC) -shared -o program.exe -Wl,--out-implib,program.a

currently results in 'program.exe' and 'program.a' being generated, but 
'program.exe' isn't actually an executable.  It's a library!  And 
attempts to run it fail.

$(CC) -o program.exe -Wl,--out-implib,program.a

results in a working 'program.exe', but a silent failure on creating 
'program.a', so no such file exists when this command is done.

And the reason all this is necessary is so that you can compile/link the 
various modules like dialback, jsm, pthsock, etc., where they may be 
coded to hook back into the main executable.  In *nix, these kinds of 
issues don't seem to exist as they do currently in Cygwin.

End result:  For the main executable code in ./jabberd, I simply left 
the Makefile alone for now, using a very old way of building such things 
under Cygwin.  Please see that Makefile or read the outdated Cygwin FAQ 
page for more details.

Anyway, hopefully this information might be of use to someone.  I'll 
quit now as my fingers are a little sore :-/ and I'm getting tired. 
Please note, as I've stated more than once, I don't code professionally, 
so please go easy on the flaming if I'm way off-base here.
