Some remarks:

- The main difference between 124 and 25 seems to be the lack of Cookies?
- Is there some kind of standard/convention for the /webclient part? Or 
will the user have to supply this? IMO it would be nice if there would 
be some kind of default for this to make the lives of the users (and the 
support staff) easier.

If we're going to create a JEP that's going to supersede Jep-25 then it 
would be nice if we also add some (really useful) functionality to it. 
IMO it would be _extremely_ nice if the protocol would also support two 
way traffic. I.e. the client connects to port 80 on the server to send 
packages but the server can also connect to the client through port 80 
with an HTTP request.

This would be _extremely_ useful to make it a LOT easier to integrate 
Jabber into websites. The main problem with web integration is that it's 
either limited to one way traffic (only messages from the site to the 
user). If you want two way traffic you'll need either a bot or control 
over a Jabber server to receive messages. Most sites run on shared 
hosting and those admins are not allowed to run any bots.

If the server could just it's responses/messages to a simple 
PHP/JSP/Perl/whatever script on the website then it would be trivial to 
implement Jabber integration. I've said it before (quite a few times now 
I think ;)) IMO web integration is really one of the points in which 
Jabber can really excel. It's _very_ hard to properly integrate 
MSN/ICQ/AIM/Yahoo into a website, especially if you want two way 
communication.
