<PRE>Hello. I'm intending to write a game similar to &quot;Master of Orion&quot; or 
&quot;Elite&quot;-series as jabber-server component. The main idea is to write a &quot;Space 
life server&quot; that will simulate economics and battles of whole galaxy. The 
user will register on service and participate in the game from now on.
Very similar idea is realized here:
<A HREF="http://real4x.pibank.ru/en/index.htm">http://real4x.pibank.ru/en/index.htm</A>
but real4x - is a closed source game with proprietary clients. I wrote authors 
about sharing their ideas or ever participating in open project but they 
remain silent for now.

I think that such game can be build on a MUD-like principles. All control and 
most incoming data will be textual. So the usual jabber-client will play the 
same role as telnet plays in MUD game: you CAN use it but you will be much 
more comfortable with specialized one.
Another main idea is something that I call &quot;feature binding&quot;. The client while 
connects to service, registers itsel as able to receive some types of data. 
F.e.: specialized client will register itself as &quot;full featured&quot;, usual 
client will be registered by user in some simple way and will declare a 
&quot;usual client subset&quot;. And I plan to write a special &quot;SMS-client&quot; that will 
take only a few short and most important events and deliver them to user's 
mobile phone and will take user's abbreviated commands and translate them to 
service for some &quot;game correction&quot;. Since I am working for mobile operator I 
will easily make such client and since I planning to make project open and 
host in on sourceforge - (and ready game server somethere in Internet) many 
users all around the world will can to participate and make game more 
interesting.
