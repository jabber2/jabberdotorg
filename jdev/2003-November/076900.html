&gt;<i> Hi Richard, once again:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Well, I think it is better to solve the hard problems up front. We are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;talking conferencing, not audio chat. It gets a big deal when you
</I>include
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;video. If we get the framework right for audio then an audio-video
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;environment is just a bigger datastream but the bandwidth gets
</I>lumpy...so
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;better to ensure the bandwidth is properly considered. I am a bit of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;tartar when it comes to what name we give. If this is audio chat
</I>protocol
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;then I will shut up as it is a different problem domain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have been talking about audio conferencing, not video, thats is a
</I>whole
&gt;<i> &gt; different kettle of fish, we should try to do each the best way, and for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; normal people p2p is the best way for audio.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should be all posible. We dont onyl rely on audio, because the
</I>&gt;<i> original subject was videoconferencing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sure but you cant really &quot;mix&quot; video streams very sucessfully can you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We never want taht. The problem with audio was, that there is only one
</I>&gt;<i> chanel to play off. The videos can all be shown on the monitor, one
</I>&gt;<i> by one. That is not the problem. Of course the server can distribute
</I>&gt;<i> that stuff so taht not all clients must send all videos to all
</I>&gt;<i> clients (same discussion again).
</I>
I can see for video it can help your outgoing bandwidth but because you are
still receiving the same amount of data it doesnt help incoming bandwidth
using a client server mode rather than p2p, but remember at the moment I
think it is very unlikely people will host these servers (especially not for
video) so we need to make sure we dont build this so it relys on servers to
operate, also I dont think the client acting as a server mode will really
work for video at all as it is very unlikely users will have the bandwidth
to host it because the fastest common upstream bandwidth in the UK certainly
is 256kbps and you will not get many good audio/video streams into that.

&gt;<i> We dont want a war, but if Microsoft controls that stuff you never know
</I>&gt;<i> when they switch of the light. Also Microsoft rely on SIP and they dont
</I>&gt;<i> have any interest to support XMPP in any way. Try to install Windows
</I>&gt;<i> Media Player 9.1 and read, what they say about the spyware components
</I>&gt;<i> they want to install. If you read my first mail, i said that cross
</I>&gt;<i> platform is very important to that stuff. I hate it if i cant use
</I>&gt;<i> GnuCash or GnomeMeeting on Windows and FileZilla on Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> So i use wxWindows to get that problem fixed.
</I>
I assume you hadnt read my messages after this before you wrote this, it was
never a suggestion to make us reliant on anything proprietory just a
suggestion of something that we can take advantage on windows systems to
help windows developers/users.

Richard
