I believe you need an active attack no matter what.  With the JSF issuing 
certificates, it would make it that much more complicated to attack 
effectively.  Working at an ISP would not be enough to perform an attack.  
You'd have to compromise the JSF servers or cert registration system somehow.

And being the first to register for a particular domain isn't going to get an 
attacker very far.  The actual server owner isn't going to be using the cert, 
and he could prove that he never got the it by simply asking JSF members to 
connect to his server and see that fact.  I think an attacker would have his 
hands full trying to make this appear otherwise.
