I did say conferencing, not Videoconferencing and you are clearly talking
about some form of informal Audio Chat. Conferencing is quite different. It
is very important to use the right name for what we talk about.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yea 42 audio streams in total are buzzing around, but that doesnt matter as
</I>&gt;<i> that doesnt really have any impact on each individual client, quoting this

</I>
It is far from the only impact - a p2p client is basically a server as it
has to manage all the comings and goings and establish links to all who are
in the conference and tell everyone when they are disengaging. Just lovely
for a mobile phone client...

I agree with Jesper on this. Your post strongly implied that such a solution
was 'the solution' as a means to mitigate against concerns raised. It is
*so* important not to dismiss concerns using an assumption on hardware or
platform. 

In a few years time many people will be running their windows shell on a
massive server which will NOT have a local dedicated sound card to offload
the audio processing to. Also remember that a mobile phone pays by the bit,
so 8kbps is far more desirable than 48kbps, and these are the people just as
likely to be Audio Chatting.
