<PRE>Hi Matthias,

&gt;<i> No it isn't. It's very unlikely that all people are speaking at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time - at least they should to be able to communicate ;)
</I>&gt;<i> With silence detection you don't have more streams than with a central
</I>&gt;<i> server but I have a far more balanced load in the network.
</I>
Could be true, Nonetheless if you have 9 people in germany and one in 
the nevada foodhills this is not the way (i think).

&gt;<i> And as we spoke off list: Voice conferencing would be very interesting
</I>&gt;<i> for companies too. And they can use multicasting in their network as
</I>&gt;<i> they control it themselves. Everything that is already integrated in the
</I>&gt;<i> existing transportation protocols (e.g. RTP).
</I>
Yes, that's true, but we dont made this for companies. As i said before 
one of the goals is to get a firewall friendly solution for smal 
entitys. Big companys can install existing VoIP systems with H323 and 
they can split the internet from the internal net. Have you ever tried 
to get Netmeeting running over a linux gateway running on a 486DX4100 
without the need to switch of your firewall. It is completly a mess.
One of the point was to get a solution that only use one (or some) ports 
(like Jabber) and can be easy integrated in simple firewalls.

Best Regards,



Carsten Breuer
