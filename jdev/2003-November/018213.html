<PRE>&gt;<i> That's where all this leads to. The masses are not familiar with

</I>&gt;<i> The masses don't have enough bandwidth to send out 100 streams to a big
</I>&gt;<i> conference (100 streams with as low as 2.5k/s sum up to 250k/s, WOW!
</I>&gt;<i> YES! P2P is the solution if only one person speaks). Can we please
</I>&gt;<i> forget about basic p2p and all those smart network stuff with nodes as
</I>&gt;<i> super nodes and so on? It really get's annoying.
</I>
With UDP and silence detection your stated bandwidth requirements will come
right down, as only one person will normally be talking at once otherwise no
one would understand what is being said. Also will you please stop going on
about how a server should be required in all cases when it simply is not for
normal peoples everyday use, p2p is better for that and nothing to say will
change that, I can see that a server based approach will be needed in a
limited amount of cases but you going on saying the server approach is
always better without backing up your reasoning with realisic proof  is
getting really annoying (sorry but 10 people in 1 conversation is not
realistic normal usage, 2 maybe 3 is more like it).
