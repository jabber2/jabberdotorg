Well, I think it is better to solve the hard problems up front. We are
talking conferencing, not audio chat. It gets a big deal when you include
video. If we get the framework right for audio then an audio-video
environment is just a bigger datastream but the bandwidth gets lumpy...so
better to ensure the bandwidth is properly considered. I am a bit of a
tartar when it comes to what name we give. If this is audio chat protocol
then I will shut up as it is a different problem domain.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As to bandwidth, unless I am missing something each peer needs to send out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their audio to each member - 7 people means 6*7=42 streams out. With a
</I>&gt;<i> sever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have 12 streams to the 6 clients - one out and a mixed one back (sans
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your own data). Even if the output stream is broadcast, with p2p each
</I>&gt;<i> client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will have to mix those 6 streams so it is almost the server anyway! With a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server based solution the client only has a single stream in and out to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handle and the server is the only one doing the donkey work and
</I>&gt;<i> technically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not much more than a client would do in a p2p environment, which is
</I>&gt;<i> logical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as in p2p each p has to be a server in anything but name.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes you are missing something 6 people will mean 6 streams in and 6 streams
</I>&gt;<i> out on each client, meaning 12 streams on each client, which is only 48kbps
</I>
No, you are really missing something - all the other people in the
conference! For 7 members it is 42 audio OUT channels buzzing around with
each client dealing with the mixing of the 6 they are listening to/being
sent - and do no assume that we have a windows system, and one that is
likely to have that ever-changing conveyorbelt of proprietary protocols from
'Dandruff Bill'.

[ I have combined replies as we seem to be having a similar problem here as
a p2p conf!] ;-)
