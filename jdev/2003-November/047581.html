Urm well yea, thats why as ive said you have the protocol determine the
bandwidth capabilities of each client and only let on the amount of clients
you can support, also this will still be a problem when trying to use the
client acting as a server mode if you dont have things to stop too many
people joining, what happens when some more join the conference and it
doesnt have enough bandwidth, the entire conference will likely go down.

&gt;<i> one thing forgotten, someone will definitely host the relay servers,
</I>&gt;<i> this can definitely be good advertising!
</I>
I think you are very wrong, also where does the advertising come in?? Also
remember internet advertising is still in a slump after the dot com bust so
I dont think just advertising would really cover the cost anyway.
