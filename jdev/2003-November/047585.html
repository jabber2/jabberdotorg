I wasnt under the impression that ie relied on proprietory codecs, I was
under the impression you can use any codecs that are installed on the
system, or that you could pipe waveform PCM into it from multiple sources at
once and that it would recombine them and output them automatically. Also I
wasnt saying that we would require DirectX to be able to do audio just that
you could use DirectX on windows to help take the load of the processor and
increase performance, and I was also suggesting that there might be some
other mechanism in Linux like DirectX that can be used to increase the
performance in a similar way. Like I say, there is no reason for some kind
of a holy war just because its made by Microsoft, you need to try not jump
to conclusions too quickly and try to understand what I meant, this kind of
zealotry can be very damaging to the credability of the community.
