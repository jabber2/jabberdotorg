Winjab originally had support for multiple conversations with multiple
resources, which is not what you're suggesting, but it's not what the current
I-D says either. The &quot;users&quot; I heard from (in droves via private email) were
_real_ honest-to-god users using my client. They all (and I mean ALL) wanted the
behavior that the draft is suggesting. It doesn't ever make sense to have
multiple chat windows open to the same bare jid (<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A>) since that is not
how we converse in real life. This approach is basically the opposite of what
you're proposing. The current I-D proposes a middle ground.

This stuff has come from experience of the jabber community (client writers
mostly). Not from a &quot;marketing droid&quot; survey of some kind.

&gt;<i> Any suggestions on how to handle this then? For example, I change
</I>&gt;<i> computers and goes to my laptop, my desktop client is set to away (by
</I>&gt;<i> autoaway or manually setting it to away), I log into my laptop. My

</I>&gt;<i> question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the message followed the client where I actually is, this wouldn't

</I>
&quot;Following the client&quot; is a LOT harder than this one scenario. The model that I
use in Exodus is this:
- When a user dbl-clicks a contact in the roster, open a chat window and send
the first message to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host.</A> This allows the server (and possibly filtering
rules setup by the recipient) to determine which resource to send the message
to.
- When I receive a reply back, I &quot;lock in&quot; that resource (<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A>/foo).
- If <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A>/foo goes offline, then I unlock the window and start sending
messages to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host</A> again.
- If the user sends me a reply from a different resource, I lock in that new
resource.
[.. and here is the kicker ..]
- If I _close_ my window, and dbl-click the same contact, I reopen the same
window (showing old messages), but reset the jid back to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host.</A>

What typically happens in the situation you describe above is that when you go
away, I would _usually_ (but not always) close the window. Which resets the JID
back to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">user at host.</A> This is how the majority my users seem to operate (based on
feature requests/bug reports/private email, etc..).
