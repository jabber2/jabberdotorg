<PRE>I gmane.network.jabber.devel, skrev Richard Dobson:
&gt;<i>  I wasnt under the impression that ie relied on proprietory codecs, I was
</I>&gt;<i>  under the impression you can use any codecs that are installed on the
</I>&gt;<i>  system, or that you could pipe waveform PCM into it from multiple sources at
</I>&gt;<i>  once and that it would recombine them and output them automatically. Also I
</I>&gt;<i>  wasnt saying that we would require DirectX to be able to do audio just that
</I>&gt;<i>  you could use DirectX on windows to help take the load of the processor and
</I>&gt;<i>  increase performance, and I was also suggesting that there might be some
</I>&gt;<i>  other mechanism in Linux like DirectX that can be used to increase the
</I>&gt;<i>  performance in a similar way. 
</I>
So what you _was_ saying, were that this is totally an issue of the
client implementation to do whatever it wants to do to get the
audio/video out?

If thats the point I, then I don't care and I don't know why we got into
this debate. Then it is of no importance to the protocol, right? 

&gt;<i>  Like I say, there is no reason for some kind
</I>&gt;<i>  of a holy war just because its made by Microsoft, you need to try not jump
</I>&gt;<i>  to conclusions too quickly and try to understand what I meant, this kind of
</I>&gt;<i>  zealotry can be very damaging to the credability of the community.
</I>
Trying to make sure that people don't rely on proprietary thing that
cannot be implementet on all platforms, if thats zealotry, then Ok. But
that's not zealotry in my world.
