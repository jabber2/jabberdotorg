<PRE>&gt;<i> Well, I think it is better to solve the hard problems up front. We are
</I>&gt;<i> talking conferencing, not audio chat. It gets a big deal when you include
</I>&gt;<i> video. If we get the framework right for audio then an audio-video
</I>&gt;<i> environment is just a bigger datastream but the bandwidth gets lumpy...so
</I>&gt;<i> better to ensure the bandwidth is properly considered. I am a bit of a
</I>&gt;<i> tartar when it comes to what name we give. If this is audio chat protocol
</I>&gt;<i> then I will shut up as it is a different problem domain.
</I>
I have been talking about audio conferencing, not video, thats is a whole
different kettle of fish, we should try to do each the best way, and for
normal people p2p is the best way for audio.
Sure but you cant really &quot;mix&quot; video streams very sucessfully can you? You
cant overlap them, the only thing you can really do is combine them into an
ever increasing composite with all of the video streams either side in one
big streaming video, this will require massive bandwidth and an enourmously
powerful server, and the only thing it helps with is the outgoing bandwidth
(you only have to send it to one place), the incoming bandwidth will still
increase just as much as if you had received it p2p as the composite will
get bigger and bigger.

&gt;<i> No, you are really missing something - all the other people in the
</I>&gt;<i> conference! For 7 members it is 42 audio OUT channels buzzing around with
</I>&gt;<i> each client dealing with the mixing of the 6 they are listening to/being
</I>&gt;<i> sent - and do no assume that we have a windows system, and one that is
</I>&gt;<i> likely to have that ever-changing conveyorbelt of proprietary protocols
</I>from
&gt;<i> 'Dandruff Bill'.
</I>
yea 42 audio streams in total are buzzing around, but that doesnt matter as
that doesnt really have any impact on each individual client, quoting this
total stream number is irrelivant as the only impact on the client is the
total number of streams it is receiving and sending. Also I wasnt assuming
that everyone has windows (when did I?) I was just showing a solution that
will work on 90% of client machines (if the market share figures are to be
believed), i expect there is a similar solution for Linux but I dont know
much about that sort of thing in Linux so I didnt mention that, there is no
point in not using a technology just because it is made by microsoft, lets
not turn this into some kind of silly holy war.
