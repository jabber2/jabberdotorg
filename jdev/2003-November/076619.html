The solution is to inform others where you actually are. ;-)

Just because you recently signed on with another resource does not indicate 
that you are physically there.  If you have a laptop and a desktop both 
connected to Jabber with different resources, and both in different locations 
in your house, and you are standing in the hallway, where shall new messages 
go?

I say ensure that the priority value is accurate for where you want new 
messages to go, and then your friends' clients should be able to use this as 
a hint.  For a newbie client, you might have their chat window immediately 
switch resources to the highest priority.  Maybe a more technical client just 
informs the user, &quot;Mikael/Laptop, has signed on with a higher priority&quot; (this 
could be an event / popup or something, or logged in the existing chat 
dialog).
