If I were initiating a conference (ie I was the server) and I lost my
connection d*mn if the rest of the meeting can rattle on without my hearing
it. It might be OK for Xbox but in a business environment it is very
important to have all members around all the time and especially the
Chairman!

As to bandwidth, unless I am missing something each peer needs to send out
their audio to each member - 7 people means 6*7=42 streams out. With a sever
you have 12 streams to the 6 clients - one out and a mixed one back (sans
your own data). Even if the output stream is broadcast, with p2p each client
will have to mix those 6 streams so it is almost the server anyway! With a
server based solution the client only has a single stream in and out to
handle and the server is the only one doing the donkey work and technically
not much more than a client would do in a p2p environment, which is logical
as in p2p each p has to be a server in anything but name.
