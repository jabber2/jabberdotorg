<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Just imagine a server with 10 conferences running and 10 people in each
</I>&gt;<i> conference, that would for each partipicant in each conference give 10
</I>&gt;<i> streams from the server to a client total of 1000 streams. 
</I>&gt;<i> It is not my public-server that supplies bandwidth for that. 
</I>
That's a lot of bandwith, but this is not a point. Also the current
stuff with H323 or VoIP need a lot of bandwith, but we dont care about
that at the moment. Perhaps people will pay for that.

As you know, i started this because there was no solution to have your
freedom to start a videoconference between 98 and XP with tze
MSN-Messenger. Also H323 ist not firewall-friendly. We have discussed
this here in the jabber list alot.

The point was that people have the freedon (because GPLed Software) to
run conferencing servers and doesn't need software that is limited by
maketing, spyware ot what else.

We will see how this works.

BTW: I'am discussing this stuff also in our company newsgroup and
      there is a lot of interest for this topic. I want also to let
      the software (Jabber, Caminotalks) run on a PDA with WLAN and
      WebCam. This means that you do video conferecing at every place
      where WLAN is posible(At home, at thje airport, in the train)
      etc and Jabber should be the platform to start the conderence.
      There are allreay PDA's with WevCam and WLan. Take a look
      to the Sony CLIE. I will post this also to the sony clie forum.
      Perhaps this boost Jabber a lot.

Best Regards,



Carsten Breuer
