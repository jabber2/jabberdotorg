Hey David!

I'm afraid I don't have much of a choice.

	Under Cygwin, MU-Conference v0.52 == BOOM!

I can get it to compile under Cygwin, and I can fire up Jabberd with 
MU-C hooked in, but the moment I try to create a room, BOOM!  Jabberd 
segfaults and I lose my entire Jabber server.  MU-C v0.3, on the other 
hand, has been a rock-solid champ so far.

I realize it's not up-to-date and has issues of one sort or another, but 
as the Cygwin version of Jabberd 1.4.x was never officially supported, 
and all I've done is found a way to be able to build it a little bit 
better than what it was before, not to mention build/hook in things like 
JUD and MU-Conference, I figure something is better than nothing.

For example, even with what I've done, under Cygwin you cannot run 
Jabberd in debug mode (i.e., jabberd -d), as it segfaults before getting 
anywhere.  I believe I've tracked this down to GNU Pth, which in turn is 
doing a fork(), which is just wreaking havoc under Cygwin.  I can't 
explain why it's happening, as all I've been doing is massaging 
Makefiles to mimick what was done in earlier work and getting pieces to 
compile/work together.  But these kinds of side effects I haven't had 
time to figure out, as it requires doing a good bit of debugging work or 
digging through the code and figuring out what all's going on (and I 
just don't have that kind of time at the moment).  Other than this, 
however, Jabberd runs just fine.  I've had a server up for weeks at a 
time, only restarting when the Windows box it was on had to be restarted 
(usually due to security updates :-) ).

By the way, I just emailed peregrine, the listed owner of the MU-C 
component on JabberStudio, earlier today with the modified Makefile 
attached.  But I notice your name whenever discussion of MU-C is going 
on here on the list.  Are you peregrine?  Or have I sent email to an 
outdated address?
