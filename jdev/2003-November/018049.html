Hmm, IMO this is one of the implementation issues that should be at 
least mentioned in the specs. It's _very_ confusing for the user if 
different clients behave differently in this respect. I'm not saying 
that some behaviour should be enforced in the client but it would be 
nice if the clients would all try to use approx the same rules in this 
respect.

Same goes for things like registration.

In some clients you have to enter:

- Username
- Server (last part of JID)
- Host (where do you want to actually connect to)
- Password
- Resource
- Priority

other clients ask for

- JID
- password/resource/priority
- IP (to connect to)

others only ask for
- JID
- password/resource/priority

or
- Username
- Server (last part of JID)
- password/resource/priority


In these cases it's not an easy task to explain someone how to start 
using Jabber when they're not using the same client that you are working 
with :\ It's also not trivial to explain this procedure in a 'Jabber 
user guide' or on jabbercentral.org

So IMO in these cases it would be nice if there was some 'Client UI 
design best practices'-guide :D
