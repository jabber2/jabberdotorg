Good point.  There is the &quot;Microsoft IPv6 Developer Edition&quot; that's 
available in WinXP Pro, but you're right, &quot;out of the box&quot; so far 
nothing has it built in except maybe 2003 Server.

It would be nice if (assuming it's possible) some of the functionality 
that apparently the Jabberd 1.4.x coders tapped into were somehow 
wrapped or mimicked in Cygwin.  Both Jabberd 1.4.x and the new Jabberd2 
(not to mention a few other *nix-based projects) seem to rely on 
functions such as inet_ntop(), even though I would suspect almost all 
usage is in the IPv4 space.

Again, I don't code for a living.  And I definitely don't know the ins 
and outs of Cygwin's core or code at that level (though it's pretty 
clear that some differences in OS archictecture are apparently quite 
difficult to emulate...like *nix fork() in Cygwin).  So I'm not really 
in a position to even say &quot;Why don't they have XYZ in Cygwin?&quot;, as there 
might be a darn good reason.

At best I hack with application level code, and that's only when 
personally motivated enough like with Jabber.  I wanted an open-source, 
open-standard IM protocol as the base for a dept. IM server.  Jabberd 
was what really caught my eye.  But I'm stuck in a Windows world for the 
moment, so decided to have a go at it using Cygwin.  And here I am. 
Damn computers. :-)
