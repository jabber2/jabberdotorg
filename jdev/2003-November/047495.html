NAT traversal is a tough cooky in applications like 
conferencing-audio/video -- all the solutions I heard of are based on 
some kind of proxy that can be contacted without NAT, which means people 
will need to have some kind of mini-server they are connected to, and 
that means that the proxy could be required to handle alot of streams 
for many NATd endpoints.
There are ways to minimize the problem, by detecting if a endpoint is 
NATd or not and using direct connections when possible and proxyd 
connections when not, but that only helps handling the problem, not 
solving it.
I heard about some way of using UDP-wrapped-TCP packets to traverse 
NATs, but never quite got into it deep enough to understand how the hell 
it's supposed to work.
