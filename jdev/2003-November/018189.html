<PRE>Hi Carsten, 

due to the ongoing discussion on both lists, i simply respond to both
lists. it's hard crossposting, but it's for both roups relevant (i
think). 


+After having thought about control structures, it makes sense to me to
do the extra work and merge this creamed cake into a jabber server
component. Otherwise a control channel to the server component would
have to be opened, or a splitter to divide the incoming audio bytes from
control bytes would have to be added, which won't make things less
complicative.+

Of course it is possible to create a standalone server relay, too. 
But my relation to jabber.org tells me to do it that way... ;-)

ok. 

to speex: *now here comes the more important part, can we build a c++
component which does what avrelay does? is it practicable to de/encode
100 streams with a c/c++ speex de/encoder in realtime?* COMMENTS WELCOME


The other part is, what do you think about a cooperation? All help on
this welcome! 


to jabber: *We would need some protocol enhancements to the jabber
protocol to control muting of conference partners. It makes sense to me
to enhance the current jabber MUC protocol with some audio/video
specific stuff.* COMMENTS WELCOME


Best regards, 
Ulrich

P.s. on the relay, carsten: 
The relay you may download at
<A HREF="http://greenthumb.jabberstudio.org/avrelay.html">http://greenthumb.jabberstudio.org/avrelay.html</A> contains server and
client.

a server has to be started, onto which a client can connect. 
The client has to know the ip of the server. 

the client is started through the command listed on the avrelay.html
page.
the server is started through 'java uls.AVRelay'

The server listens by default on port 10000 (i think), can't remember
what i wrote 6 weeks ago. 

The server encodes in the session.java file.
The client encodes and decodes in TestClient.java. You'll see the
classes when looking through the code.
