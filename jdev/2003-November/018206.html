Anway, this scenario misses something. A client would have to decode ten
streams! And i wouldn't go with, 'it's very unlikely'.

Matthias, in your university, are *you* able to cross routers/networks
with multicasting? Propably not. Me neither.I can multicast in my subnet
but not past that subnet and no admin will allow that from one second to
the other, even if i am the genious from mars. 

If you knew nothing of computer science, networks and so on, would you
ask an administrator to allow multicasting packets cross routers and
bridges into other networks? 

That's where all this leads to. The masses are not familiar with
routers, NATs, RTP, RTSP, UDP, TCP. 
The masses don't have enough bandwidth to send out 100 streams to a big
conference (100 streams with as low as 2.5k/s sum up to 250k/s, WOW!
YES! P2P is the solution if only one person speaks). Can we please
forget about basic p2p and all those smart network stuff with nodes as
super nodes and so on? It really get's annoying.
