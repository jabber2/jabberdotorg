<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i>Now some other join the conference and suddenly some can't handle the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>traffic. annoying ...
</I>&gt;<i> Urm well yea, thats why as ive said you have the protocol determine the
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth capabilities of each client and only let on the amount of clients
</I>&gt;<i> you can support, also this will still be a problem when trying to use the
</I>&gt;<i> client acting as a server mode if you dont have things to stop too many
</I>&gt;<i> people joining, what happens when some more join the conference and it
</I>&gt;<i> doesnt have enough bandwidth, the entire conference will likely go down.
</I>
Yes, and for that you need a smart load balancing if you doing so.
You can measure some things before you add the one to the list.
So it is 3 phase:
1. Someone want to join the conference
2. His internet capabilitys are measure by a client or server
    who has enaugh bandwith.
3. If the client can be added without danger for the conference,
    he is added.

BTW: There coud also be more then one client acting as a server.

&gt;&gt;<i>one thing forgotten, someone will definitely host the relay servers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>this can definitely be good advertising!
</I>
Hey, i have meationed that before &lt;vbg&gt;.

&gt;<i> I think you are very wrong, also where does the advertising come in?? Also
</I>&gt;<i> remember internet advertising is still in a slump after the dot com bust so
</I>&gt;<i> I dont think just advertising would really cover the cost anyway.
</I>
Could be, i dont know.
However IM ist just starting to be hipp. This will increase much more if 
people can use the stuff on there PDA's anywhere. So we are the pioneers 
of a new and free technologie here (1). I think most people dont like 
chat, because they dont have the emotional feedback. I said to my 
sister, hey let us make a chat conference and she said: &quot;I hate chat 
conferences, come back if the video stuff is ready! How long will it 
takes?&quot;. So this could be a large argument of advertising.

If you are on the airport with your PDA dpoing a videoconference and
the teh owner of the WLAN can give you advertising about the restaurants
around, this si a complete different scenario.

(1) Of course others are also here and we must sure not to get in one of
     the patent traps everywhere around us (see <A HREF="http://swpat.ffii.org/">http://swpat.ffii.org/</A>)
     for more info..

Best Regards,



Carsten Breuer
