UPDATED CYGWIN PATCHES / CRYPT

Downloaded the latest CVS today.  Thanks for adding in the Cygwin patches.

However, the new ./jsm/modules/mod_auth_crypt.c file helped point out a 
glaring omission on my part (TRANSLATION:  I had a brain fart :-/ ). In 
various Makefiles (most notably ./jsm/Makefile, but applies to others as 
well), I forgot to add $(LIBS) to the end of the dllwrap line.

Currently those lines read

	dllwrap --def ... $(LDFLAGS)

but they SHOULD read

	dllwrap --def ... $(LDFLAGS) $(LIBS)

mod_auth_crypt.c also showed that libcrypt (&quot;-lcrypt&quot;) was not part of 
the standard LIBS definition in Cygwin.  Not sure if this latter part is 
Cygwin-specific, or whether the ./configure script should be modified on 
line 36 to read

	LIBS=&quot;$LIBS -lcrypt&quot;

so all platforms have this.  For now I have modified ./configure under 
the Cygwin section by adding a line (line 171) to read:

	LIBS=&quot;$LIBS -lcrypt&quot;

To play it safe, I am attaching a new version of the tar/gz file (with 
the same files) I initially sent, and the necessary Makefiles and 
./configure script already modified.  Comparing these files to the CVS 
versions should point out the changes pretty easily.  This might be 
easier than me describing what I've changed.  Again, apologies for not 
sending diffs.  If you need any more information, or need me to send 
this any other way, please let me know.

FYI:  With these last few adjustments, I have compiled the latest CVS 
without issue, complete with SSL.  I even hooked in JUD, MU-Conference, 
etc., using same techniques already described in original post, and 
everything just worked.  So these last tweaks should do it.

____________________________________________________________
REGARDING LATEST CVS (downloaded 02 Nov 2003)

During compilation, I noted just one warning message from the entire 
compilation:

...

gcc -g -Wall -I. -I.. -I/usr/include/openssl -DHAVE_SSL 
-I/usr/local/include  -I
../../jabberd/   -c -o mod_browse.o mod_browse.c
mod_browse.c:250:3: warning: no newline at end of file

...

Minor issue at worst, and does not impact compilation/linking.  But 
thought I'd mention it since you asked us to test this.

____________________________________________________________
GNU Pth

For what it's worth, I've been compiling against GNU Pth 2.0.0 without 
issue for several months.  I believe Pth 1.4.1 may have issues, but any 
issues I see (which I believe are more Cygwin-specific and due almost 
exclusively to fork()ing) in Pth 2.0.0 are the same as in Pth 1.4.0.

By the way, I noticed your vote to *exclude* GNU Pth from the 1.4.3 
distribution.  Is that the plan?  Or was that just thinking out loud?

Though the build of Jabberd is by no means bulletproof when it comes to 
systems which do not have Pth already compiled/installed, I found it 
handy to have Pth included in the Jabberd tarball when I first started 
(and even later when building Jabberd on clean systems).  Only much 
later did I Google for the latest version of Pth and start tinkering. 
For folks not altogether familiar with the Pth library, this exclusion 
might cause more grief.

And if excluded, shouldn't ./configure be modified to remove all the 
lines relevant to Pth compilation?  If I read it right, if Pth is not 
installed and Pth 1.4.0 is not included with Jabberd in the place where 
it was for Jabberd 1.4.2, the user will get a one line message saying no 
version of Pth found on the system, complete with a URL to the Pth site. 
  But shouldn't we at least provide some indication as to what version 
they need to download/compile/install?  Just a thought.
