Wouldn't a solution like:

1) Try SOCKS5 stream
2) If it fails, try negotiate IBB one? Somehow add a tag that it is
connected, so Spark client can accept it automatically and the other
clients would get it too, with little more bothering of user. (Anyway,
it would not be PSI, because it does not know IBB AFAIK).

If I'm missing something, then I'm sorry to bother and silently ignore
it&#8230;

Thanks
