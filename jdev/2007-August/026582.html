</I>
As long as the XML does not contain any restricted XML elements like
CDATA, processing instructions, comments, ...

Best is to read RFC 3920(bis) section 'XML Usage' to avoid any confusions
that might emerge from &quot;you can send any XML you want&quot;, because you
can't send just &quot;any XML you want&quot;.

Of course SOAP does already limit it's XML usage to not contain
processing instructions. But you might need to take care of CDATA
usage and comments (which are maybe a bit uncommon to be used in a
SOAP implementation, but to gurantee maximum reliability better check
your SOAP implementation).
