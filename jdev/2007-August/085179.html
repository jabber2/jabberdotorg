<PRE>Hey Devray,

Jabber servers can indeed by clustered. Just place the router, c2s and 
s2s components on different machines: although I have never done it 
myself. You will have to work it out. I'm sure you can get documentation 
somewhere: the ejabberd website seems to have the best documentation, so 
check there, all the ?jabberd servers follow the same basic principles; 
so you should be able to adapt it.

As for the OS X accounts, you will have to do it, probably, via SASL 
plain-text once an encrypted stream has been negotiated. Unfortunately, 
you are not going to run away from writing a bit of code here. You 
should avoid a custom SASL method, because clients won't support it and 
chances are the Mac APIs (or almost any OS API for that matter) need 
plain-text usernames/passwords anyway. You will then need to impersonate 
that user in your process. You will then be able to access their files etc.

Another option is to use process isolation, that is, your server will 
spawn separate processes for each client using their credentials. You 
can then handle communication to each client's process by using 
shared/mapped memory. You will have to write a server from scratch for 
this, sorry, it all depends on the semantics of impersonating a client 
on Mac (which I have absolutely no idea about, but I am pretty confident 
that starting a new process is a sure-fire way of impersonating on 
almost any OS).

Good luck Devraj.

Regards,
  Jonathan Dickinson
