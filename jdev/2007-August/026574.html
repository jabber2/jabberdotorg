<PRE>Hi Jonathan,

I will explain the situation ( in my student project):

&quot;My&quot; Company A has many partner companies (say many thousands) and each 
partner company has many tausend employees.
Each partner company has a presence server, the clients are the employees. 
those employees/clients are my business parterns.

For many business processes in my company I need purpose cooperation the 
presence information of the employees of my partner companies, aka. the 
clients of their presence servers.

Because I have many different business processes in my company that need 
the presence information of each my business partners, it will be more 
efficient, when I have in my company a Database with the actual presence 
information of the business partners.

At least these 3 scenarios are theoretically possible:

1. I have a &quot;special&quot; client, that is subscribed to all my business 
partners. So I can write a program, who cathes the presence information 
from my special client and saves it in my database.

2. I have a &quot;special presence server&quot;, who gets the presence information 
directly from the presence servers of my partner companies und saves it in 
my database. 

3. I write a special server extension to each presence server type of my 
partner companies. this extension &quot;logs&quot; the presence information of my 
business parterns and sends it my database.

Maybe there are other possible scenarios. But which ones of those 3 
scenarios are possible in practice. Is there another possible scenarios 
other than mine.

summarization: Say Yahoo and Google are my bussiness partners. I need in my 
company a Database with the actual presence information of their users.

Thank you in Advance for your Effort.
