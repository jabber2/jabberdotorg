<PRE>Wow! That's awesome! I just want to re-iterate that XMPP is stateful, I 
would really like to be able to write code like this against a server:

ImageServer.LoadImage(&quot;somebackground.png&quot;);
ImageServer.OverlayImage(&quot;someavatar.png&quot;, 100, 100);
ImageServer.GetImage();

That's just a demonstration, but I am sure you can see that it has far 
better qualities than SOAP over HTTP, in which you would probably have 
to write the following:

int token = ImageServer.LoadImage(&quot;somebackground.png&quot;);
ImageServer.OverlayImage(token, &quot;someavatar.png&quot;, 100, 100);
ImageServer.GetImage(token);

I really, really, really, just want to point out that you should adapt 
the framework (Axis2 in your case) to cater for stateful SOAP calls. If 
you use the host JID for hosting the SOAP methods you could even use 
SASL to handle authentication instead of ugly Login() methods. (WildFire 
meets Axis, what fun!). I am a C# programmer, but I can think of many 
ways in which it will be simple to implement (associating a class with 
the SOAP methods with each client connection).

You really need to sit down and think about how you can streamline SOAP 
as a whole using XMPP. You definitely have me thinking!

Good Luck! Java is definitely the way to go when you want to get ideas 
out there.
