<PRE>If you want your server to expose a SOAP endpoint you will need a 
plugin, otherwise you could always have a custom Jabber client and have 
JIDs like <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">creditcards at bank.com</A> and <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">accounts at bank.com.</A>

It makes more sense to make the server JID (e.g. bank.com) the SOAP 
endpoint, but that isn't always possible: as it seems to be in your case.

Furthermore, I would recommend you alter your SOAP framework somehow, 
because SOAP is stateless where XMPP is stateful, you can leverage this 
to your advantage (in my honest opinion, XMPP is better suited to Remote 
API than HTTP). E.g. most SOAP endpoints require a login of some form, 
you can have the user log in once using a Login method instead of 
sending credentials/tokens each time another method is called.

Good luck!
