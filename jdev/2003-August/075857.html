<PRE>Hello all,

I've developed a java applet that we're hoping to use for customer support.
The user will fill out a form and automatically be logged into Jabber using
an account taken from a pool.

The plan is to have a support person, on the remote end, sit in a private
room and invite users who are waiting.  (We want to use group chat instead
of direct messaging so that we can invite a supervisor if needed, and also
because of the ability to set a nick that's different than the actual pool
user name)

It's assumed that a service rep will never invite more than one customer
into the room at a time.

Anyway, everything works but there is a security issue associated with using
group chat.  Unless the service rep. quits and then recreates his/her room
after each customer (which we certainley can't depend on) a number of old
messages from the preceding customer are sent to the applet as soon as it
joins the room.  Obviously, these messages could contain info that we don't
want them to see.

I realize that the server does this by default but is there a way to alter
this behavior?  I can do it programatically, but I have to assume that
someone will eventually decompile the applet and see what's happening.  (Or
just find a way to connect with a different client)

So in short, I want to prevent my server from sending recent messages to
clients on join.

Thanks in advance,

matt



P.S. Sorry for the cross-post.  Not sure where this one fits.
