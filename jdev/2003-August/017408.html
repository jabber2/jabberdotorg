<PRE>FYI, the OpenOffice groupware project [1] has started an effort to 
define a standard address book schema. Jabberites and others are 
welcome to join.

Subject: Defining a &quot;standard&quot; address book schema

Hi all,

Thanks for your interest in participating in a working group to define a 
standard schema for address books.  I apologize for the delay in getting 
the group started but I wanted to get as much feedback as possible on 
the merits of this working group.  Based on the input I've received, 
we're ready to move forward.

All the feedback has confirmed what we already know and that is the need 
for standardization and agreement on a common schema for handling 
address book data in groupware solutions.

To support the efforts of this group, we've created a sub-project within 
OpenOffice.org's groupware project to be the primary source for 
information and news on this initiative.  The OpenOffice.org groupware 
project website is:

<A HREF="http://groupware.openoffice.org">http://groupware.openoffice.org</A>

Although the project pages have not been created yet, we do have a 
mailing list.  The mailing list for this working group is 
&quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">schema-dev at groupware.openoffice.org</A>&quot;.  I will be adding each of you to 
this mailing list (please let me know if you DO NOT want to be added) so 
you should not have to do anything to subscribe.

I believe this initiative is an extremely important one for the 
&quot;maturation&quot; of open source groupware solutions.  So, it is exciting for 
me to be taking part in this group.  I hope you feel the same way. 
Since there are no &quot;legacy&quot; considerations here, I want to officially 
open this forum for your ideas and thoughts on how best to proceed.

The goals of this project in a nutshell are to define an address book 
schema that is: (edited from original text by Colm Smyth)

- GLOBAL (supports locale-specific data)
- INTEROPERABLE (defines bi-directional mappings to other important
  schemas)
- CURRENT (supports the latest Internet protocols and standards)
- INDEPENDENT (does not use names or identifiers that imply
  an association with any specific software)
- WEB-AWARE (uses URL's to reference sophisticated or &quot;large&quot;
  contact-related information outside of the addressbook schema)

I'm sure these goals will get updated as we go along.

One of my tasks over the next few weeks will be to get more projects and 
communities involved in this working group.  Ultimately, to make this 
group successful, we need to create consensus from a diverse group 
supporting a diverse set of needs and wants.  So, the group should grow 
over time.  But I think we have enough people/projects represented here 
to get started.  Please feel free to invite others to participate.

As a way of starting some discussion on this topic, I'd like to get a 
sense of what people think should go into a &quot;standard&quot; address book 
schema.  Yes, the question is intentionally vague because I think we all 
have different ideas of what can be accomplished in this working group.

Since I haven't subscribed everyone to the list yet, you may want to 
&quot;reply all&quot; for the time being.  Doing so will automatically send a copy 
to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">schema-dev at groupware.openoffice.org.</A>

Thanks.

Best regards,
Edward Buck
