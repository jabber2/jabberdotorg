That's not the point of having compliance testing and listing. The 
people who do compliance tests would report the bugs, and they should 
report it to your bug report system as well.

The list is so that anyone working on any aspect of Jabber can go and 
take a look at why the system is messing up. When a new version of 
software is released which fixes the bugs, the compliance testers can 
then mark the bug as completed. This list is for the community, not for 
specific client developers. No one will expect or force developers to 
directly deal with and keep looking at this compliance problem list. 
This is so people doing compliance testing can get organized.

*Example*:
I see gnome-jabber sends out &lt;show&gt;normal&lt;/show&gt; in its presence. As a 
person working on compliance testing, I file an issue on the Jabber 
compliance list. Then I file a bug report with gnome-jabber. If the 
gnome-jabber guy fixes it in the next release, then I can mark the 
compliance issue as completed, and now that aspect of gnome-jabber is 
closer to being compliant with Jabber and XMPP.

In the future, when we actually start having a 'stamp of approval' for 
Jabber Compliant clients, this list will be useful. It's not a separate 
list that client authors have to deal with. It's a list for the 
community to watch so they know clients to avoid.

If you personally don't want to deal with the JSF, the Jabber 
community, or the compliance of your client to the JSF's protocols, 
then ignore the list.

Julian
