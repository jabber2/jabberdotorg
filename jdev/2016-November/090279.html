<PRE>Couldn't you film the talks and make them available for people that, 
like me, will not be near London by the time of this event?

I would really like to see these talks.

&gt;<i> Folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're in or close to London in early December, we'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> welcome to you this free event. This event is unaffiliated with the
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP Standards Foundation, though quite a few members (including Board
</I>&gt;<i> and Council) happen to be attending.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/XMPP-UK-Meetup/events/235240643/">https://www.meetup.com/XMPP-UK-Meetup/events/235240643/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Let's Talk About Security **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like every Instant Messaging app these days is touting itself
</I>&gt;<i> as having the latest security... But what about XMPP?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is XMPP &quot;secure&quot;? From what? And what does that really mean, anyway?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the leading experts in XMPP security - not just in the UK,
</I>&gt;<i> either - are coming to talk to us about encryption, strong
</I>&gt;<i> authentication, content controls and more, in an all-round great
</I>&gt;<i> evening of talks and discussion - fuelled and followed by the odd
</I>&gt;<i> glass of something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'll learn about XMPP's use of both well-established
</I>&gt;<i> certificate-based technology and the bleeding edge of end-to-end
</I>&gt;<i> encryption. We'll discover how XMPP is used securely across a vast
</I>&gt;<i> array of wildly different ecosystems. And most importantly, there will
</I>&gt;<i> be pizza.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Space is unfortunately very limited, so please let us know if you're
</I>&gt;<i> coming - it's free to attend, all we want in return is your voice in
</I>&gt;<i> the discussions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Speakers **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steve Kille - Content Marking
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steve has been working with Internet technologies for decades, and was
</I>&gt;<i> present when the Internet arrived in the UK. CEO of Isode Ltd, one of
</I>&gt;<i> the instigators behind LDAP, and a renowned expert in secure
</I>&gt;<i> messaging, Steve will be giving us his expertise in Security
</I>&gt;<i> Labelling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel Gultsch - End to End Cryptography
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel is lead developer of the popular Android client, Conversations,
</I>&gt;<i> and also one of the authors of the OMEMO XEP bringing Double-Ratchet
</I>&gt;<i> cryptography to XMPP. Currently serving on the XMPP Council, he has
</I>&gt;<i> implemented three different forms of end-to-end encryption in
</I>&gt;<i> Conversations, and will be discussing their strengths and weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dave Cridland - S2S Security
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dave has put bugs into many of the leading XMPP Servers, and is
</I>&gt;<i> currently project lead for IgniteRealtime's Openfire, lead developer
</I>&gt;<i> for Surevine's Metre, and serves on the XMPP Council. He'll be talking
</I>&gt;<i> DANE, DNSSEC, PKIX, and Dialback and server to server security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kevin Smith - XMPP Trunking
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kev leads Isode's XMPP team, including both M-Link and Swift
</I>&gt;<i> development, and has previously led development on the well-known Psi
</I>&gt;<i> client. Currently serving on the XMPP Editor team managing the
</I>&gt;<i> specifications, he has previously served a record length of time on
</I>&gt;<i> the XMPP Council. He will be discussing non-traditional ways of
</I>&gt;<i> linking XMPP servers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matthew Wild - Comparative Theology
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matthew currently serves on both the Board of the XMPP Standards
</I>&gt;<i> Foundation and as project lead of Prosody, a leading XMPP server. He
</I>&gt;<i> has previous served a number of years on the XMPP Council. He'll be
</I>&gt;<i> comparing the security found in XMPP with other protocols.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really looking forward to this event, hope to see you there - and
</I>&gt;<i> really, do sign-up (for the sign-up averse, let me know directly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dave.
