<PRE>Hi

We are developing a site which has uses Pubsub to send out  
notifications to browser based clients using BOSH. For the most part  
this is working really nicely - however, we are running into problems  
with keeping the browsers cache of the pubsub data in sync with what's  
really on the server.

As a user navigates around the site any stanzas that have been  
received but not yet processed and stored are lost - and as such we  
fall out of sync with what is on the server. We have thrown around the  
idea of figuring out if the cache is stale by making further requests  
- but it seems like trouble throwing more code at the problem. We are  
keeping the cache so that the browser does not have to re-request  
everything on each page load.

Has anyone else come up against this type of problem - and do you have  
any advice?

Under the covers the server is ejabberd and on the client side we use  
strophe.

Cheers

Theo
