Subject: [jdev] HTTP gateway

&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Due to the asynchronous  nature of XMPP this makes for quite a different 
</I>&gt;<i> programming style  under the hood to ensure everything has worked 
</I>&gt;<i> smoothly - or adopt a  very naive approach of fire and forget.
</I>
I could see how this could be a problem, but XMPP *does* actually deal with 
this problem:
1. Message nodes SHOULD be guaranteed to be delivered.
2. IQ nodes always respond. I can't remember the exact XEP - but there was 
one that dealt with 'progress reports' from long-running IQ processes. Maybe 
someone could fill in this blank?

&gt;<i> I keep seeing solutions to this type of thing involving custom  ejabberd 
</I>&gt;<i> modules and the like - but this tends to result in lock in  and makes 
</I>&gt;<i> support difficult (what happens when ejabberd internals get  updated), we 
</I>&gt;<i> also loose features like decentralisation. It is proving  a problem for us 
</I>&gt;<i> in that the 'best practice' for writing this type of  code is totally 
</I>&gt;<i> unknown - and concepts familiar to web developers are  unused.
</I>
Depending on your problem this is unavoidable. Some problems can be solved 
completely distributed (on the client); while others simply can not. Maybe 
if you gave us an example?


&gt;<i> An idea I have been toying with for a while is an HTTP gateway that 
</I>&gt;<i> operates in a similar way to RESTful services ( please forgive  me :-) ), 
</I>&gt;<i> for operations which typically involve IQ stanzas and  dataforms where we 
</I>&gt;<i> care a lot that they get done correctly - and less  so about using the 
</I>&gt;<i> most efficient transport.
</I>
I believe you are looking for this: <A HREF="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html">http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html</A> 
(BOSH).

&gt;<i> So what I propose is building a HTTP service which provides a  convenient 
</I>&gt;<i> interface for configuring XMPP servers. This would probably  use HTTP 
</I>&gt;<i> basic access authentication
</I>
No no no! :) . Rather stick with SASL please; HTTP does support it under the 
covers. Of course PLAIN is fine if you are running via SSL/TLS, but does not 
fit nicely into the XMPP stack.

&gt;<i> to deal with login and then build  upon the URI's specified in the XEP's 
</I>&gt;<i> to provide a very simple  synchronous interface which other application 
</I>&gt;<i> developers can hook into  and still allow them to use all of the awesome 
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP features - but  control it in a way they find easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are peoples thoughts / criticisms / suggestions?
</I>
I remember there was a XEP about XMPP via SOAP - I am not sure what came of 
that. That would be an interesting start if you have a SOAP jscript library. 
Regardless I would be interested to see what you come up with. Best of luck.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Theo
