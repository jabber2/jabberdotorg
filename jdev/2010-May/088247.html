</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I've built a minimal xmpp client to keep track of contacts presence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; status.  In previous versions, if a user asked a contact for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; subscription to presence, my client automatically granted it.  Now I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; want to notify a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; contact of such a request and let them grant or reject it. I have it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; working according to rfc 3921 section 8.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I do have one question/issue though.  If a users presence request is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; denied by the contact while the user is online, he gets notified of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rejection as defined in section 8.2.1 (using the ejabberd server).  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can then pop up a notification stating &quot;so and so rejected your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; request&quot;. But if the user is offline when the rejection happens, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; then logs in, he gets no such notification.   He just gets his roster
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with that contact in the &quot;none&quot; state with the &quot;ask&quot; flag stripped and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; no indication of how that contact got that way. Since  a contact can end
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; up in the none state in various ways, I can't use that fact to pop up a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; notification. So my question is, how can I give a user notification that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; his subscription requests were rejected while he was offline?  I see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that psi has the same issue and so does Exodus. They give rejection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; notifications while the user is online, but not when he got the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rejection while logged off and then logs on. Any way to implement such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; feature?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This might be possible by storing the unsubscribed stanza on the server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when the user is offline, ie. adding a rule similar to the fifth rule of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; section 3.1.3 in section 3.2.3 in 3921bis-06, and then sending this when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the roster is fetched.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I suppose we could add a note about this to rfc3921bis (currently
</I>&gt;<i> we assume that the unsubscribed is merely an FYI and not something that
</I>&gt;<i> the receiving server needs to continually poke the client about).
</I>
I wondered if servers lately were not relaying unsubscribed events, at least 
in the case of breaking an active subscription, because many people find the 
event to be rude.  I know that breaking an active subscription isn't the same 
as denying a subscription request, but I'm sure there's overlap in the code 
so I just wanted to throw that out there.
