<PRE>Hi all,
  After a year and a bit of development, Swift is now entering public beta.

As posted at <A HREF="http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2010/05/28/first-public-swift-beta-released/">http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2010/05/28/first-public-swift-beta-released/</A>

</I>
&quot;Over a year ago (while writing XMPP: The Definitive Guide with Peter
Saint-Andre) Remko Tron&#231;on and I were reviewing the current state of
XMPP clients and saw a gap for a simple cross-platform client
targeting normal end-users who just want to chat. Swift is the client
that we&#8217;ve been working on since then to fill this hole, and now we&#8217;d
like your help with the project. Swift assumes that what you want to
do most in your client is chat &#8211; either with a single person or a
group of people &#8211; and that the experience should be based on making
this easy and enjoyable.

The first public beta (preview) of Swift is now released, and we&#8217;d
like you to help us. Primarily, we&#8217;d like feedback from you as to what
needs to be done now, and also to find any issues &#8211; either technical
or in usability &#8211; with what we&#8217;ve already done. This isn&#8217;t a final
release, so you shouldn&#8217;t download it unless you&#8217;re willing to find
issues in it, and report them back to us so we can improve it.

We&#8217;ve got Windows and Mac binaries ready so far. The source compiles
on Windows, Mac and Linux, and with a little coaxing I even managed to
give a demo on an N900 Maemo phone at FOSDEM this year.

The Swift 1.0-beta1 release page [1] has links to the downloads and
the source, visit it now and get started with Swift, and then use the
mailing list[2], or the MUC room [3] to start discussing it.

[3] xmpp:<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">swift at rooms.swift.im</A>?join
&quot;

We're looking forward to getting feedback from everyone, as work to
make 1.0 the best Swift release ever!

/K
