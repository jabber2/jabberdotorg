</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do have one question/issue though.  If a users presence request is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rejection as defined in section 8.2.1 (using the ejabberd server).  I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> request&quot;. But if the user is offline when the rejection happens, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then logs in, he gets no such notification.   He just gets his roster
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with that contact in the &quot;none&quot; state with the &quot;ask&quot; flag stripped and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no indication of how that contact got that way. Since  a contact can end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up in the none state in various ways, I can't use that fact to pop up a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notification. So my question is, how can I give a user notification that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> his subscription requests were rejected while he was offline?  I see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that psi has the same issue and so does Exodus. They give rejection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notifications while the user is online, but not when he got the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rejection while logged off and then logs on. Any way to implement such a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This might be possible by storing the unsubscribed stanza on the server
</I>&gt;<i> when the user is offline, ie. adding a rule similar to the fifth rule of
</I>&gt;<i> section 3.1.3 in section 3.2.3 in 3921bis-06, and then sending this when
</I>&gt;<i> the roster is fetched.
</I>
Yes, I suppose we could add a note about this to rfc3921bis (currently
we assume that the unsubscribed is merely an FYI and not something that
the receiving server needs to continually poke the client about).
