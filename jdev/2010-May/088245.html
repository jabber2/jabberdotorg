</I>&gt;<i> contact of such a request and let them grant or reject it. I have it

</I>&gt;<i> I do have one question/issue though.  If a users presence request is
</I>&gt;<i> denied by the contact while the user is online, he gets notified of the
</I>&gt;<i> rejection as defined in section 8.2.1 (using the ejabberd server).  I
</I>&gt;<i> can then pop up a notification stating &quot;so and so rejected your
</I>&gt;<i> request&quot;. But if the user is offline when the rejection happens, and
</I>&gt;<i> then logs in, he gets no such notification.   He just gets his roster
</I>&gt;<i> with that contact in the &quot;none&quot; state with the &quot;ask&quot; flag stripped and
</I>&gt;<i> no indication of how that contact got that way. Since  a contact can end
</I>&gt;<i> up in the none state in various ways, I can't use that fact to pop up a
</I>&gt;<i> notification. So my question is, how can I give a user notification that
</I>&gt;<i> his subscription requests were rejected while he was offline?  I see
</I>&gt;<i> that psi has the same issue and so does Exodus. They give rejection
</I>&gt;<i> notifications while the user is online, but not when he got the
</I>&gt;<i> rejection while logged off and then logs on. Any way to implement such a
</I>&gt;<i> feature?
</I>
This might be possible by storing the unsubscribed stanza on the server 
when the user is offline, ie. adding a rule similar to the fifth rule of 
section 3.1.3 in section 3.2.3 in 3921bis-06, and then sending this when 
the roster is fetched.
