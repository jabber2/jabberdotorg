<PRE>Andr&#233;,
XMPP has three strengths: extensibility, vendor-independence, and
openness.
XMPP also has three weaknesses: extensibility (there is no clear &quot;right
way&quot;), vendor-independence (no big pusher [not even Cisco pushes it]),
and openness (there are many projects out there, but rarely a focus on
excellence).
There are proposals to address the first weakness (e.g., [1][2]). The
second and third have been neglected for many years, but now several
are working on it (notably Conversations [3], but also Monal [4] or
ChatSecure [5]).
With the weaknesses taken care of, let's focus on the strengths: The
openness and vendor-independence allows us to create products that
extend the functionality of existing software. For example, JSXC [6]
provides a basis for add-ons to web applications. Plugins exist for
ownCloud/nextCloud (with an optional local XMPP server included, for
easy bootstrapping), the Ilias e-learning platform, the SOGo groupware,
or the Diaspora* OSN. These combinations allow you to chat while
collaboratively editing documents, discuss problems you have
understanding part of a lecture [7], or respond to an email via video
or text chat. That is added value we can leverage. And there are
probably other integration ideas out there, waiting to be implemented
with a few lines of code [8].
In many scenarios, the federation concept (a fourth advantage) comes
much more natural than in centralized approaches. This comes in as a
natural for Diaspora*. But it also allows for cross-institution
collaboration (very active in German research and education
institutions) while keeping the identity.
The use of multiple federated identities (maybe I should add a fifth
advantage?) also allows you to separate friends and family from work
and the rabbit breeding association or public office you are also
associated with. You can switch these identities on and off during
different parts of the day, something the centralized approaches which
typically enforce a single identity (the mobile phone number).
XMPP is far from dead, but as any standard, it needs to be pampered and
nourished and we daily need to breathe new life into it, continually
living and improving it with our ideas, hopes, and excitement.

&gt;<i> Maybe not directly related to what you expected to read in replies to
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> message, but I want to say a few things that I wish that XMPP had.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am desapointed with what I can do now with XMPP. Mobiles clients
</I>&gt;<i> are not
</I>&gt;<i> as good as clients for Telegram and Whatsapp. There are alternatives,
</I>&gt;<i> which is good. But not as good when people are not using them because
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> do not give what similar programs already do well (or, if you
</I>&gt;<i> analyse,
</I>&gt;<i> just good enough), and they are popular. XMPP does not have something
</I>&gt;<i> good
</I>&gt;<i> for normal people wanting to use them. Talking with one or two
</I>&gt;<i> people??
</I>&gt;<i> That is what I offer to the very few friends whom accepted to use
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> just because I use&#160;&#160;it. But who else does??? That is missing. As I
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> said, the limitations of mobile clients compared with XMPP desktop
</I>&gt;<i> clients
</I>&gt;<i> are considerable, and sometimes they are just what I needed - in
</I>&gt;<i> better
</I>&gt;<i> words, they are just what someone who accepted it with my indication
</I>&gt;<i> needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that something meaninful in these aspects come out of these
</I>&gt;<i> encounters. Keep the list informed when it ends!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The FOSDEM organization has announced the dates for the 2017
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; edition:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Saturday 4 and Sunday 5 February. As usual, we will try to arrange
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having another Realtime Lounge, as well as a devroom, as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Call for Participation happens. Of course, you can already start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thinking about:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;* Your demo for the Realtime Lounge (if allocated). Anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; related to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XMPP or other open realtime protocols or technology goes. IoT stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; always a great thing to show off something as abstract as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;* Your talk, presentation, etc., for the devroom (if allocated).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;* Your main track or lightning talk.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Additionally, I am proud to announce that the XSF is once again
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organizing an XMPP Summit, for the 21st time. The dates are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thursday 2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and Friday 3 February.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Usually, we spend these days talking about XMPP protocols in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plenary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sessions. However, this year, we wanted to settle on the dates as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as possible to have plenty of time to do other things. We could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parallel sessions, BoFs, (invited?) talks from people outside our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community, coding or interop sessions, you name it. In fact:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; You name it!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you have any suggestions for things we could do at the XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Summit,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let me know, or write them down on our shiny new wiki page:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; <A HREF="https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summit_21">https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summit_21</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please also consider sponsoring the traditional XMPP Dinner, most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on Thursday evening, or the XSF in general. You can contact me or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other Board member on this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, jot down the dates for FOSDEM and the XMPP Summit in your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calendar,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and sign up as participant at this wiki page, so we can look into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hotel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discounts and generally prepare for another great Summit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope to see a lot of you in Brussels, again.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
