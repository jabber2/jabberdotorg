I think the usefulness of your questioning its usefulness is open to debate.

&gt;<i> I wonder: what would

</I>
There's two cases I can think of.

1) User has message delivered (ie, the message is not lost). When user
focuses the chat window, or otherwise takes action such that the message
has clearly been presented to the user, send a receipt. This indicates to
the sender that the message has reached the user.

This is useful in the sense that it aids conversation flow - like those
messages you send to someone immediately after &quot;Right, back later.&quot; - it's
useful to know if those were seen or not.

2) User has message delivered. User is requested to click a button to
indicate the message has been read and understood, and will be acted upon.

This is useful in the case where a MEDEVAC request has gone through a MUC
room, and it's important to see who has seen the notice and started action.
Interestingly, this would need to transit MUC rooms, and have lists of
users that need to acknowledge it.

My understanding is that the OP is after (1) only, but I suspect it'd be
worthwhile investigating (2) as well.
