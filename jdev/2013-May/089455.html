<PRE>Hello;
&gt;<i> [JH] I do think another interesting case is where the message is in fact &#8220;read&#8221; by a agent/bot/program (e.g. service bots or even M2M messaging),  a timestamped receipt request is in fact helpful as there is a temporal difference between the reception, processing and response to a message &#8211; would be a real-world case 1 example.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I can see the value, and would propose that really means some &quot;tangible&quot; action must occur for it to be a valid &quot;receipt&quot;. No different than in the human world where I sign for an envelope at the front door. I say this because what you are saying is that the &quot;value&quot; here is to show the &quot;forensic&quot; data, that &quot;time-stamp&quot; you mention. It should in fact be the record of when the button was pushed, or the app &quot;signed off&quot; on receipt. It could include a variety of things, the other side can see a display (client side) of &quot;read&quot;, but the data around that transaction could be stored as a &quot;receipt&quot; which could be used in a lot of business or forensic applications. All of which in theory could have tremendous value in a variety of usage model cases. 

I think all of us that have used Skype or iMessage know about the challenges of &quot;message receipt&quot; in a multi-cleint scenario. 

Regards,

Jon
