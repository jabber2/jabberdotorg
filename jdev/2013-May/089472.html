<PRE>I am not aware of such servers/clients to exist, and was unable to
find it. However, i am not too much involved into jabber development,
so i could miss something.
The target to solve is explained below (i posted this on juser
maillist <A HREF="https://www.jabber.org/juser/2013-May/006962.html">https://www.jabber.org/juser/2013-May/006962.html</A>).


Having read a bit about priorities, i figured out that configuring it
thoroughly is not a solution for me.
I just want to have all my chat log available on any client i sit at.
I.e. i may have both home &amp; work PC (or some more, i don't want to
care) online (or offline, i don't want to care), on any priority (i
don't want to care for auto-away and priority switching feature
support), i want to always have all chat history.
I have googled a bit, and found that there's a XEP implementing
server-side history saving, but none free services are known to
provide that feature, also status of this feature on client apps is
unknown.
I mentioned skype in subject because it provides chat log
synchronization between your app instances and your chatmates
instances. The only flaw is inability to sync when no chatmates or
your instances are online.
It is affordable for me to have my own always-online server set up and
tunneling all my jabber registrations on other open jabber services.
If the solution is not quite here, i am able to make up some code for it.
