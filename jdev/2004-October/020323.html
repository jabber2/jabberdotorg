<PRE>Hello. Sorry slightly offtopic question.

I need to know which data is reliably delivered to the other party for my 
currently developed jabber server.
If the client silently looses it's connection server will not notice 
it and will continue to send messages to it during all the time of tcp 
timeout. 
Currently we know this as &quot;blackhole effect&quot; - if you will loose connection 
you will risk loose messages that will be sent to you during tcp timeout time 
window.

When time out will be hit - connection will broke so I need to know 
wich packet was delivered last and wich were just dropped by tcp/ip stack to 
re-send them later when client come back online.

I know that such info can be obtained from tcp's acknowledged sequence number 
but I haven't found how to access it.

Please help.

I think that answer for this question was published on this list several weeks 
ago but now I just can not find this particular mail.

Respectfully
Alexey Nezhdanov
