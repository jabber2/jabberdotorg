But IMO it's kind of typical that an article from December last year 
springs to mind :D

Just about every site and magazine out there has an article about the 
silly 7.0 version of MSN Messenger. That's the kind of coverage that we 
should get. Not one article in last years magazine :D

Anyway. IMO it could be benificial to have something like a press 
release that we can send to news sites/magazines about the Jabber RFCs. 
I'd love to write them but my english sucks when it comes to this kind 
of stuff. I tried it before but failed misserably with this kind of 
marketing like writing... But if noone picks this up then I can give it 
a try... I need something for some Dutch magazines and newssites anyway.
