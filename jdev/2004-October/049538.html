&gt;<i> Hi -- I was reading the PUBSUB spec.  In the following example of creating a node, how does the client know to send the stanza to pubusb.jabber.org?     My guess would have been that the client first makes a disco call to find the TO JID.   The same is true for the to jid on publish stanzas.    But I did not see this in the spec.  Some clarification would be helpful.

JEP-0060 depends on the notion that there is a Publish-Subscribe service
that keeps a record of nodes and subscriptions and makes sure that publishes
result in notifications to the subscribers. Usually, this service is a
server side component on a regular Jabber server, much like components
for groupchat or gateways to other IM systems.

So, to discover such components, you would send a disco request to a known
server (for example, the one hosting your account) to get a list of components
(disco#items). Then, asking each of those for its info (disco#info),
a pubsub service should reply with an identity where category='pubsub' and
type='service'.

The JID of a service is also the destination for publishes to the nodes hosted
by that service.
