Thanks.
I looked for pub/sub components and found only Idavoll. Is it the only
way  
to do pub/sub?

&gt;<i> At one point I was advocated Jabber mailing lists based on pub/sub
</I>&gt;<i> which would do pretty much exactly this. Basically just using pub/sub
</I>&gt;<i> on messages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It shouldn't be all that hard to adapt pub/sub to do this.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's an idea i want to realize at my local jabber server. It has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something common with mailing-lists and IRC. There should be some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> groups (i.e. 'sport', 'media') with free membership: any user of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server may join any group or leave it at any time. When user 'A'
</I>sends
&gt;&gt;<i> message to a group, the message is broadcasted to all group members,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but replies to this message are sent only to 'A' (that differs from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mailing-lists). This should be useful (and actually was useful with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> local icq server) for almost-instant searching, asking questions etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With slightly hacked icq server the system worked this way: you write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message with group name to specific virtual user. Server broadcasts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the message to everyone in group, saying it's from you. So everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> else thinks it's a common message from you. Then conversation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continues one-to-one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mailing-lists are not suitable, as they have large delays (2 minutes
</I>-
&gt;&gt;<i> too long) .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IRC channels (or jabber conferences) do not suit, as they need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attention all the time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sending message to miltiple contacts is bad: every user will have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configure group list himself (supposing 300-400 members per group).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there any component or something to make this work?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have some ideas how to do this myself, but none of them is really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good, because I don't want to edit server code or make users
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Search-Add-Message every time they want to reply.
