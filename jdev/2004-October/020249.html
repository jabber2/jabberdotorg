Is BartVB aware of the project?  He has been trying to organize this for a 
long time now, and I hope you two are working together.

I browsed through the site, and while I'm aware it is still a work in 
progress, I'd like to throw in some critiques:

- I like the &quot;Jabber in 3 steps&quot; idea, especially the recommendation of 
creating the account from a webform.  However, there seems to be a bit of a 
separation between step 1 and 2, such that the user will have to remember his 
choice.  It would be better if there were a way for the user to select his 
server and immediately register an account.  What I suggest is that this page 
should give a brief description of each step (as it does now), but there 
should be no links other than a &quot;Proceed to step 1&quot; (or some such) at the 
bottom.  Then the website can guide the user through the process.  Step 3 
should probably send the user straight to the client listing page, rather 
than containing its own duplicate list.

- Say &quot;Microsoft Windows&quot; instead of &quot;MS Windows&quot; (I know, I'm being nitpicky 
here, but consider who we're targetting).

- The Intro to Jabber contains too much information.  Throw out the non-IM 
stuff or references to XML (users don't care), and introduce Jabber as 
another IM system, but with a difference.  I've found that saying it is the 
&quot;5th&quot; IM system, after specifically naming ICQ, AIM, MSN, and Yahoo, helps 
send a clear message that Jabber is another system entirely, and not a 
Trillian ripoff.  This is the #1 confusion with Jabber. As nice as /we/ might 
find the &quot;Jabber in a Nutshell&quot; text, the whole thing should probably be 
scrapped.  Or maybe some of this stuff could be moved into the &quot;Going 
Further&quot; section.

- It's great to see that you'll be reviewing clients.  The Psi review is 
probably fine, though I think a screenshot or two would make the thing nicer.  
However, the review is much too long for the casual new user.  What I suggest 
is that in the client listing page, each item would contain a short blurb 
about the client with a small (or clipped) screenshot.  If the user wants to 
read more, then he can click to see the full review.

- There should probably be no more than 4 clients in the client listing.  This 
way it will be possible for the user to make a quick and easy decision.  It 
would probably be a good idea to mark the topmost item as &quot;recommended&quot; with 
a gold border around the entry or something.  This way the users don't even 
have to think if they don't want to.  Offering direct download links would 
also be good, so that you don't confuse users by sending them to a foreign 
website.

- The 'Forum' link should probably be closer to the top.  'Clients Help' 
should probably be in the 'Clients' section somewhere.

That's all for now. ;-)
