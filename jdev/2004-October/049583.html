with a simple interface is Bitlbee/../, if you have time to change 
interface you might start here, but if you're in a hurry, Jabber clients 
that have an interface similar to ICQs are Psi/.../.' 
Or similar, please excuse my 10am wording skills. 
This is even more overkill, and yet seems like rather a good idea to me, as
