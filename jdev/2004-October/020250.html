<PRE>&gt;<i> - There should probably be no more than 4 clients in the client listing. 
</I>&gt;<i> This
</I>&gt;<i> way it will be possible for the user to make a quick and easy decision. 
</I>&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> would probably be a good idea to mark the topmost item as &quot;recommended&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> a gold border around the entry or something.  This way the users don't 
</I>&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;<i> have to think if they don't want to.  Offering direct download links would
</I>&gt;<i> also be good, so that you don't confuse users by sending them to a foreign
</I>&gt;<i> website.
</I>
Limiting the amount of clients in the listing to an arbitary value is 
probably a bad idea, your idea of what the best clients are maybe very 
different from others, what would be better IMO is to have a list of clients 
which includes any which pass a certain set of criteria, i.e. certain 
features such as disco support would be required, also the list of clients 
would be sorted using ratings of the clients submitted by users (e.g. like 
this site <A HREF="http://www.dyndns.org/services/dyndns/clients.html">http://www.dyndns.org/services/dyndns/clients.html</A>) which allows a 
more balanced level of opinion of what are &quot;the&quot; best clients and not what 
could be an unintentionally biased choice.
