Hi all,

I was looking for docs on this issue, but couldn't find anything useful, so 
here is my question.

I would need something like a permanent data storage (possibly a relational 
database, let's say mysql).

Here's the scenario:

I would like to develop a client that, besides including the standard IM 
features, allow users to draw graphical schemes (if someone is interested, 
I could explain more on that, but for the purpose of my question it could 
be enough).

So, basically, users would have something similar to a virtual whiteboard 
and would do the drawings in a collaborative way.

Now the issue is that I would like to store the graphical scheme 
permanently into a database, so when one logs in, he/she is able to get the 
current drawing.

Another issue is to have real-time drawing update.

So, as I see it, this is theoretically what should happen when an user 
draws something (let's say a line):

1. User draws on the drawing canvas of the client application
2. The client sends to Jabber the XML description of that graphical element
3. Jabber stores that into a database
4. Jabber broadcasts the update to other connected clients.
5. Other clients update their drawings.

So, fundamentally, my questions is: does anyone have any suggestions on 
features, already available components, examples, experiences useful in my 
case? Will I have to develop a new Jabber-to-database component?

Any hint?

That you in advance.

Best regards,
Ivan
