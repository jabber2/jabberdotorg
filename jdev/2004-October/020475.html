<PRE>Hello JabberD'ers,

I have to find a solution to the Flash XML socket problem very soon.
I read that there was a large discussion about this subject in April this
year

I have a cuople of questions now:

Is there anybody who build/is building this proxy program ?

Is there anybody who hacked Jabber 2.0 ?
(Despite the fact that it's not the correct solution but
forced by the evil force of a deadline. :( )

Is there anybody who has some other working solution ?

If there is no working solution yet and I have to build something
can anybody provide some outline of what exactly needs to be done.
And maybe some example template proxy program to start with.
I would like to build the proxy but cannot oversee the complexity now
because I'm pretty new to Jabber, linux server programming etc.

I have about two weeks before my deadline strikes ...

Off cource I would contribute my work back to the Jabber community.

Thanks for help

Marcel
