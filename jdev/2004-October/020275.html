&gt;<i> What do you have in mind for user-friendly content changes on jabber.org?
</I>
Not sure because IMO jabber.org is fairly OK as a developers portal. But 
this is the first sentence of the 'What is Jabber' page:

&quot;Jabber is a set of streaming XML protocols and technologies that enable 
any two entities on the Internet to exchange messages, presence, and 
other structured information in close to real time.&quot;

Imagine what happens if your grandmother reads that ;) Or what happens 
if your grandmother figures out that she can talk to her bridge parter 
through Jabber if she installs a client. To choose a client she'll go to:
<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.php">http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.php</A>

Where she proabably doesn't even knwo what a platform is, what MacOSX, 
J2ME and linux are and she has no clue if BuddySpace is better than Psi 
or maybe it's better if she uses Yabber or Pandion?

IMO it would be great if Jabber.org could focus on protocol development 
and if jabbercentral (or whatever it's going to be called) on guiding 
starting endusers or developers.

But for the 'What is Jabber' page it would be nice if it would start 
with some plain language that tells the reader that Jabber is a great 
Instant Messaging system with great clients like Psi and Pandiom (or 
whatever) and state some advantages for your average user. Being based 
on XML is not one of those advantages ;) Maybe a 'quickstart' page for 
endusers is a nice intermediate solution until the community site is 
properly up and running?

Or just direct those vistors to <A HREF="http://www.jabber.org.au/">http://www.jabber.org.au/</A> (although that 
site could use some updating :D).
