<PRE>I think so, too.

btw. I expect that no jabber developers will spend time in managing 
such a webpage as they will better invest more time in their 
components&amp;clients. Therefor such a page would rather depend on some 
enthusiastic users... And such a user can not be motivated by a 
decission of the jabber council or something.

But where to find them? How to motivate them?

Even if it is only blah blah, the best looking and best organized 
*private* webpages are often found under the game webpages. Maybe we 
can motivate some Ultima Online Shard or Quake admin/user/clanmember 
to do such a thing...
