</I>
Ok, probably best not to make such broad and generalised statements then if 
even you realise its not really true :). Just be careful about slagging them 
off because if there are any decent journalists here I doubt they would 
appreciate being painted with the same brush as the some of the online 
reporters that are being pressurised to get as much stuff out as they can as 
quickly as they can, its not entirely their fault that the situation is how 
it is.

&gt;<i> But IMO it's kind of typical that an article from December last year 
</I>&gt;<i> springs to mind :D
</I>
Yup but I dont by many magazines these days, only when I want something to 
read while away from internet access.

&gt;<i> Just about every site and magazine out there has an article about the 
</I>&gt;<i> silly 7.0 version of MSN Messenger. That's the kind of coverage that we 
</I>&gt;<i> should get. Not one article in last years magazine :D
</I>
Of course, but in print magazines even MSN Messenger does not usually get 
much of a mention in the ones I see, its simply not interesting enough 
seemingly for their readers, the article I mentioned was a specific feature 
about instant messaging which mentioned most of the systems including about 
Jabber, if most magazines do not even talk about MSN Messenger what chance 
have we got of getting any column space :).

&gt;<i> Anyway. IMO it could be benificial to have something like a press release 
</I>&gt;<i> that we can send to news sites/magazines about the Jabber RFCs.
</I>
Of course they are a benefit, but this is best to do after we have the 
community site up and running so we can back up those articles which stuff 
that helps get newbies up and running as quickly as possible with the 
minimum of fuss.

&gt;<i> I'd love to write them but my english sucks when it comes to this kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff. I tried it before but failed misserably with this kind of marketing 
</I>&gt;<i> like writing... But if noone picks this up then I can give it a try... I 
</I>&gt;<i> need something for some Dutch magazines and newssites anyway.
</I>
Even if its not in English all positive exposure is good, even if its just 
in the Dutch press thats more exposure than we would have otherwise had, I 
would say go for it :)
