<PRE>I noticed in stpeters blog that the RFC numbers are going to arrive Real 
Soon[tm] now. Of course that's really fantastic but what are we going to 
do with that event?

IMO this is _the_ perfect opportunity to make the world aware of the 
fact that there is an alternative and that there is an open, working, 
standardised way for IM communication.

We didn't do much when the standards where presented to the IETF, it got 
some media coverage but not that much. IMO we should/could do a LOT 
better than that this time.

What are we going to do? IMO it would be ideal if we had a site like 
Jabbercentral going already with some basic (enduser) information about 
Jabber (what is jabber and what can Joe Average do with it?), what 
(working, easy to use) clients are there, etc. I don't know what 'Real 
Soon[tm]' is but if this is a few weeks then we can try to get at least 
a minimal site going to kickstart people that want to know what all this 
Jabber/XMPP buzz is all about. IMO jabber.org really isn't suitable for 
your average computer users (who doesn't even know what a protocol is).

If we're talking about days or one or two weeks then it's IMO smarter to 
update some of the documents on jabber.org to facilitate kickstarting 
average users and making clear what Jabber is to them. Of course we'll 
also provide (separate) information for interested developers.

Besides that, should we create a press release? Or are we going to wait 
until Jabber Inc. is going to do that? :D If we have a press release, 
how are we going to get that to interested parties? IMO it's smart to 
translate the press release and send it to national/local news sites, 
magazines and papers.

Hmm, maybe it's smart to create two press releases? One for sites like 
slashot (the knowledgeable readers) and one for sites like the NY times 
and Wallstreet Journal more targeted to your average person?
