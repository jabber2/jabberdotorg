&gt;<i> But where to find them? How to motivate them?
</I>That's where the 'community' part comes in. We have the same situation
with phpBB (www.phpbb.com). There is a small group that knows how to
write software, they concentrate on writing the new version of phpBB
(area51.phpbb.com) or they write MODs for the current phpBB release.
Besides them is a HUGE group of people that just use the forum software,
for their own site, for their company, just for fun, whatever. A part of
them answers questions by new users on the forums, and other group keeps
the website up to date, yet another group of people take care of the
translation efforts, etc, etc. So there are lots and lots of users that
know what phpBB is and what they can do with it, don't know how to
program but still want to contribute a lot of time and effort because
they like the software and the people around it (the community).

So all we need is a forum with some regular visitors. Approx the same as
they have on <A HREF="http://psi.affinix.com/">http://psi.affinix.com/</A> where endusers are designing an
(excelent looking!) new website, taking care of bugreports, writing
documentation, etc, etc.

As soon as there is a basic site with a forum there will be a community
of users that think that Jabber is cool and who want to help Jabber go
for world domination. All we need to do is a decent platform on which
such a community site can be built and kickstart the site.
