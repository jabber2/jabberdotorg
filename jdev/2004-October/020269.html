<PRE>I don't know exactly when the RFCs will be issued, but my understanding 
is that it will happen Very Soon rather than Real Soon Now (where Very 
Soon means it could be anywhere from &quot;even as I'm typing this message&quot; 
to later today to sometime in the next few days). I wrote a press 
release on Friday night (which has been approved by the Board) and have 
updated some content on the jabber.org and xmpp.org websites to reflect 
the RFC status (hidden pages, of course, which I will copy over when the 
moment arrives). I'll be contacting some people in the press once the 
release is out.

What do you have in mind for user-friendly content changes on jabber.org?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, maybe it's smart to create two press releases? One for sites like 
</I>&gt;<i> slashot (the knowledgeable readers) and one for sites like the NY times 
</I>&gt;<i> and Wallstreet Journal more targeted to your average person?
