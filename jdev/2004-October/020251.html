Yes, a baseline criteria plus user ratings is a good way to create an unbiased 
listing.  However, I still say this list should be chopped off at a small 
number like 4 (and actually, I'd be surprised if even 4 clients qualify on 
each platform anyway, depending on the criteria).  Maybe there could be a way 
to view the full list if desired, but we would present the trimmed list to 
newcomers.

Imagine if the listing was just the jabber.org list with ratings.  Yikes, I 
think we'd scare everyone away. :)
