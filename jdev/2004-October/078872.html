<PRE>Hello.

There's an idea i want to realize at my local jabber server. It has  
something common with mailing-lists and IRC. There should be some groups  
(i.e. 'sport', 'media') with free membership: any user of this server may  
join any group or leave it at any time. When user 'A' sends message to a  
group, the message is broadcasted to all group members, but replies to  
this message are sent only to 'A' (that differs from mailing-lists). This  
should be useful (and actually was useful with local icq server) for  
almost-instant searching, asking questions etc.

With slightly hacked icq server the system worked this way: you write  
message with group name to specific virtual user. Server broadcasts the  
message to everyone in group, saying it's from you. So everyone else  
thinks it's a common message from you. Then conversation continues  
one-to-one.

Mailing-lists are not suitable, as they have large delays (2 minutes - too  
long) .
IRC channels (or jabber conferences) do not suit, as they need attention  
all the time.
Sending message to miltiple contacts is bad: every user will have to  
configure group list himself (supposing 300-400 members per group).

Is there any component or something to make this work?
I have some ideas how to do this myself, but none of them is really good,  
because I don't want to edit server code or make users Search-Add-Message  
every time they want to reply.

Sincerely yours, Arty
