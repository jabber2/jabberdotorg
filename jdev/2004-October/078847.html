<PRE>But what if you simply want to use pubsub for something like extended presence or another application where each user in the system will need its own node.  Is there any way we can tell the client to send pubsub stanzas to the JID of the actual user whose node they are interested in instead of a catch-all JID like pubsub.jabber.org.
 
In particular, is there a way to put this info in disco?
 
thanks
Reza
 
PS to the Pub Sub Spec writers:
 
I really think the spec needs to have an example.  
 
 It simply states that &quot;disco#info&quot; result MUST indicate support for the features by using a feature element with the appropriate var attribute.    What var attributes should be set?

&gt;<i> Hi -- I was reading the PUBSUB spec. In the following example of creating a node, how does the client know to send the stanza to pubusb.jabber.org? My guess would have been that the client first makes a disco call to find the TO JID. The same is true for the to jid on publish stanzas. But I did not see this in the spec. Some clarification would be helpful.

JEP-0060 depends on the notion that there is a Publish-Subscribe service
that keeps a record of nodes and subscriptions and makes sure that publishes
result in notifications to the subscribers. Usually, this service is a
server side component on a regular Jabber server, much like components
for groupchat or gateways to other IM systems.

So, to discover such components, you would send a disco request to a known
server (for example, the one hosting your account) to get a list of components
(disco#items). Then, asking each of those for its info (disco#info),
a pubsub service should reply with an identity where category='pubsub' and
type='service'.

The JID of a service is also the destination for publishes to the nodes hosted
by that service.
