As I said, we don't seek it.  Slashdot is actually very easy for us to get 
onto.  Like Mozilla, PGP, Linux, KDE, etc, &quot;Jabber&quot; submissions are a 
shoe-in.  For more mainstream tech websites, like ZDNet, this is not so easy, 
but considering we've been getting decent press for every other phase in the 
IETF process, I'm sure we can expect coverage on all the major tech/computer 
outlets, particularly if it is pitched well.  If anyone is going to care 
about a network protocol, IM is it.

+1

This might also be a good opportunity to mention non-Jinc software (honorable 
mention at least for Psi, Exodus, and jabberd, which power most of our 
community), and the fact that popular multi-IM clients are including Jabber 
support (to clear up the &quot;jabber == multi-IM&quot; misconception).  Also, I think 
we should not mention transports.
