<PRE>&gt;<i> Any decent community site is going to have some kind of bias.
</I>
Of course but that bias should really reflect that of the community that 
supports it rather than the people creating the site, which is where the 
rating system comes into its own allowing the community at large to select a 
more balanced view of what are the best clients.

&gt;<i> I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think &quot;eliminating bias&quot; should be your top priority. I think &quot;making
</I>&gt;<i> it easier for people to get started&quot; should be your top priority. You
</I>&gt;<i> don't need to fear &quot;hiding&quot; other or new clients.
</I>
Of course not which is where the only showing the top few rated clients to 
the new users comes in, using the ratings you would hide the not so good 
clients automatically, but it also allows the site to be a bit more dynamic 
and represent the views of the community at the moment rather than those of 
the writers at the time in the past when the short list was compiled by 
them.

&gt;<i> I'd go so far as to say that having 4 clients in a list may be a bit
</I>&gt;<i> much for someone just starting out. I'd much rather have the user go
</I>&gt;<i> through a quick form where we find out which IM clients (if any) they
</I>&gt;<i> have experience with and recommending a client from there.
</I>
Sure, which is where the more complete list of clients comes in, you can 
filter the list of clients to the top say 3 rated clients with an ICQ like 
interface (if they are an ICQ user) or if they also use MSN a list of the 
top 3 rated clients with ICQ or MSN like interfaces.

&gt;<i> For example, I'd only recommend Psi to someone who has heavily used ICQ
</I>&gt;<i> (in fact, I think most people who still use ICQ nowadays wouldn't like
</I>&gt;<i> any clients /other than/ Psi). For someone with zero experience with
</I>&gt;<i> IM, I'd never even show them the possibility of Psi. Just look at
</I>&gt;<i> hardware web sites--most of them have a selection process where you
</I>&gt;<i> tell them what you're looking for or what experience you have and they
</I>&gt;<i> recommend based on that.
</I>
&gt;<i> Tailor the data presented to the user.
</I>
Sure this is where a more complete list of clients comes into its own, also 
if a user finds they dont really like any of the top rated clients they have 
the option of just clicking a button that gives them more options rather 
than being stuck with the only 4 that they are told about, its far better 
that they can find out about all the clients they can in the one site rather 
than having to hunt around in google looking for clients that are included 
into the recommended few.

&gt;<i> On the other side, however, if the user doesn't give that data, we
</I>&gt;<i> should still only present a quick 4 or so clients.
</I>
Of course which is exactly what I said, for the newbies give them a short 
list of the most highly rated clients, say 3 or 4 of them, and as you say we 
can always tailor that list further based on a simple questionaire.

&gt;<i> I guess my point is, really, don't worry about the bias. There's always
</I>&gt;<i> going to be bias. The number 1 concern should be in making this
</I>&gt;<i> experience easier. That means there has to be some bias.
</I>
Yes but as I say, it is far better that it is the bias of the community at 
the current time (i.e. dynamic through rating the clients) rather than the 
bias of the writers at the time.

&gt;<i> As long as the list of clients can be changed, I see no reason to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> bias at all costs.
</I>
Of course not, but if there is a simple more community spirited way of 
avoiding it its worth it, and you still solve the problem which is helping 
new users easily and quickly find a client that is good for them, but have 
the added benfit of a more balanced view of what really is the best client 
for them by having community involvement.
