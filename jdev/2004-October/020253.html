We're first kind of focussing on completing the CMS/translation 
framework but the content needs a LOT of work :) IMO this site should 
become a sort of marketing effort, not a lot of technobabble (like 
Jabber in a Nutshell) but primarily focussing on the advantages and 
getting people started. For this we need concise and to the point text, 
cool graphics/layout and lots of nice pictures :D

Furthermore I've been trying to get hold of Justin Mecham to change DNS 
for jabbercentral.com but I can't get through to him. I've tried his 
justin at j.o JID but he doesn't respond to that. Same with emails to 
several addresses that I could find of him. If someone is still in 
contact with him: please ask him to contact me through email or Jabber 
so we can take care of this...

If we can't get through to him we'll need to find a new catchy domainname.

Bart
