But the press doesn't know this yet and it's not yet (officially) and
Internet Draft (IIRC?). I have no idea how much time there is between
the AUTH48 and getting Internet Standard status?

Anyway. It's still smart to create some documents that Jabber
enthousiasts can use to bring this to the attention of news sites and
magazines all over the world.

Another question: why don't we seek publicity? IMO if we are going to
wait until the world finally sees the light then we can just as well
stop with development. Microsoft will have pushed SIMPLE through
everyones throat as the 'open standard for IM'. I'm putting time and
energy into Jabber to make the world a better place. IMO Jabber is the
way to go, but those 'investments' are kind of useless if all we do is
create cool standards, create cool software and consequently sit on our
asses while playing with our newest creations :) It's cool to be able to
chat with a bunch of nerds with Jabber clients but it's much nicer to be
able to use Jabber to chat with that long legged, blond, gorgeous
Swedish gal that you met on your last holiday :) Or to be able to
communicate with your customers/prospects/family/president or whatever.
IMO Jabber can use quite a bit more publicity (which is the main reaason
why I've been persuing (time permitting) this Jabber community site)...
