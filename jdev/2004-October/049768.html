Put an End to FTP 
With Qnext you can take a file of any size from your computer and drag it onto another users name. This initiates a secure P2P file transfer. A file can be 1 MB or 10MB or your entire C drive!

Qnext puts an end to FTP sites and email attachment limitations and makes handling large file transfers incredibly easy.

Files are sent using a secure, encrypted P2P connection directly to the other user. Receiving a file requires the Qnext user to accept and initiate the transfer.

Without any servers in the way to slow you down - file transfers occur as fast as your Internet service connection and computer system will allow. And nobody can ever hack or intercept your file transfer.

You can transfer multiple file transfers or folder to online and offline users.
