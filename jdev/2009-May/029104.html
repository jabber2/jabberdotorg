<PRE>2009/5/13 Dave Cridland &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">dave at cridland.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's been, for a few weeks now, a discussion in the IETF about providing
</I>&gt;<i> a good framework for IETF meetings - mostly &quot;interim&quot; meetings, which are
</I>&gt;<i> meetings of around 30 people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is to find product and/or technology to do these effectively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is *not* a new protocol development team, this is purely
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure, but I'm sending this to Standards@ as well as jdev@ to get a
</I>&gt;<i> better audience - if the vMeet people were given the suggestion of &quot;download
</I>&gt;<i> FooClient&quot; this would be a fine response, and actually preferable to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Implement XEP-9945&quot;. Still, I'd prefer, personally, to have some open
</I>&gt;<i> standards, as well as implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The IETF has, for some time, used XEP-0045 to handle the text-based
</I>&gt;<i> conferencing. The interesting question to me is whether we could get a few
</I>&gt;<i> additional features relatively easily deployed in support of what they need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Multiway VOIP (with mixers).
</I>
What's this?

&gt;<i> 2) Floor control, of some form. (Probably only affecting VOIP). This is
</I>&gt;<i> basically to emulate the &quot;queue at the microphone&quot;, and the concept of a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;chair&quot; (ie, &quot;chairman&quot;) and various &quot;presenters&quot;, in serial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Slide sharing. I'm actually seriously thinking that what they need is the
</I>&gt;<i> simple ability to have a file sharing thing going on, then say what page of
</I>&gt;<i> the PDF is &quot;currently shown&quot;.
</I>
Something like this is possible in Coccinella.

Instructions:
1) Convert slides to image files
2) Open directory with images of slideshow in whiteboard
3) Use Next/Previous buttons

Obviously, it would be even easier if Coccinella can open a PDF file
and automatically convert this to image files. Patches are welcome!

&gt;<i> 4) Whiteboarding. Although it pains me to even mention the word, given what
</I>&gt;<i> seems to happen every time the subject is raised.
</I>
See above.

&gt;<i> Does anyone have anything that does all this already?
</I>
Yup, at least 3 and 4.

Mvg, Sander Devrieze.
