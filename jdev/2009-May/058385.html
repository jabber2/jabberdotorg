<PRE>Folks,

There's been, for a few weeks now, a discussion in the IETF about  
providing a good framework for IETF meetings - mostly &quot;interim&quot;  
meetings, which are meetings of around 30 people.

The idea is to find product and/or technology to do these effectively.

This is *not* a new protocol development team, this is purely  
infrastructure, but I'm sending this to Standards@ as well as jdev@  
to get a better audience - if the vMeet people were given the  
suggestion of &quot;download FooClient&quot; this would be a fine response, and  
actually preferable to &quot;Implement XEP-9945&quot;. Still, I'd prefer,  
personally, to have some open standards, as well as implementation.

The IETF has, for some time, used XEP-0045 to handle the text-based  
conferencing. The interesting question to me is whether we could get  
a few additional features relatively easily deployed in support of  
what they need.

It looks like:

1) Multiway VOIP (with mixers).

2) Floor control, of some form. (Probably only affecting VOIP). This  
is basically to emulate the &quot;queue at the microphone&quot;, and the  
concept of a &quot;chair&quot; (ie, &quot;chairman&quot;) and various &quot;presenters&quot;, in  
serial.

3) Slide sharing. I'm actually seriously thinking that what they need  
is the simple ability to have a file sharing thing going on, then say  
what page of the PDF is &quot;currently shown&quot;.

4) Whiteboarding. Although it pains me to even mention the word,  
given what seems to happen every time the subject is raised.

Does anyone have anything that does all this already?

Dave.
