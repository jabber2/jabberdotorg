<PRE>I'm a little confused with something related to presence.

As a user with a JID, I have a presence associated with each resource
associated with that JID.

In the context of a groupchat (v1.0) room, is it possible to define a
separate presence? 

For example:

I am a user, &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">ian at jabber.org</A>&quot;
I am a member of a room called &quot;JavaChat&quot; and also a member of a room called
&quot;CppChat&quot;.
Is it possible to be AWAY in the JavaChat room but Available for chat in the
CppChat room?

I was under the impression that presence in the chatrooms was separate from
my overall presence.

The reason I ask is that I notice in Exodus that when I connect to a new
groupchat room it sends a presence type of available to the room (and only
that room). If I change my presence, then Exodus sends individual presence
updates to each of the rooms to which I am connected. The result is that if
I set my presence to &quot;away&quot; after joining one group and then sign in to a
second group, the first group will show me as AWAY but the second will show
me as AVAILABLE, indicating that the status is distinct between rooms but
when I change my presence, it changes in all both rooms, indicating that
perhaps my user presence over-rides my member presence.

Which is correct?
