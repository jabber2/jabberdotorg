<PRE>&gt;<i> - Would there be any reason why not supporting Jabber (because I really 
</I>&gt;<i> don't see a reason at all, it's the only protocol next to irc that they 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't have to reverse engineer)? A friend of me told me that 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft actually notified Trillian that they would change their 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol?? But of course, I don't know if that last one is true.
</I>I guess the main reason for not supporting it is the fact that Jabber 
doesn't have a huge userbase (compared to MSN or ICQ Jabber is still 
nothing).
Yes, MS helped Cerulean Studios when they where going to change the 
protocol to help Trillian to stay connected to the MSN network.
BTW It's probably known that AOL made several attempts to block Trillian 
off their network.

Maintaining/Building Trillian takes a lot of time, even with the 
protocols that they currently support. So I guess they want to limit 
theirselfs to the mainstream IM protocols. Let's just face it, Jabber 
isn't that big (yet :D I really hope this is going to change).

&gt;<i> - Wouldn't there be some hack to get Jabber into Trillian? I thought the 
</I>&gt;<i> developers of Trillian were working on an API or sth. like that, so that 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber could be supported in Trillian.
</I>True. Trillian 1.0 Pro has some rudimentary API facilities. Problem is 
that this API is extremely limited at the moment, it's not possible to 
support other protocols by writing a plugin. The developers did say that 
this is going to be possible in 'some' future release of Trillian (Pro).

I have been following Trillian closely and have beta-tested Trillian Pro 
before I made the switch :D It would be very cool if Trillian would 
start to support Jabber.. I have been able to convert quite a few 
friends to Trillian, it would be a breeze to convert them to Jabber as 
soon as Trillian starts to support it.

BTW one potential problem springs to mind.. IMO it's won't be that 
trivial for them to start to support Jabber. One of the problems are the 
transports. As soon as I add my Jabber account to trillian, Trillian and 
Jabber will start fighting over my ICQ and MSN accounts... That's not 
good :D
Furthermore if I just delete my MSN and ICQ accounts from Trillian to 
prevent this from happening then I could just as well use Psi or another 
Jabber client that is probably more fullfeatured (Jabber wise) than 
Trillian.


(BTW sorry Peter, you'll have to approve this message too, still haven't 
been able to figure out how I can add identities to Mozilla Mail in a 
clean way :D)
