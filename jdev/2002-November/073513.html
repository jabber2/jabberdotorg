&gt;<i> I am about to build a commercial jabber server in java

</I>
You can start with my book: Instant Messaging in Java: the Jabber protocols.
You can get it at amazon or any other book seller or direct at
<A HREF="http://www.manning.com/shigeoka">http://www.manning.com/shigeoka</A> The book creates a very basic Java Jabber
server throughout the book and covers the core protocols.

&gt;<i> 2. Can development be done in a way that core
</I>&gt;<i> functions are done first(ie.. sending simple messages)
</I>&gt;<i> and add more later?
</I>
Yes, the sample code in the book get's you started with a core server. It's
not designed for large scale usage or commercial deployment but can be
modified for it. The code is BSD-style licensed so you can use it as a base
for proprietary code and not worry about license restrictions.

I suggest buying and reading the book to get an idea of the scope of the
task.

&gt;<i> 3. Is it possible for a single developer to do this?
</I>&gt;<i> and if it is how long would it take?
</I>
It's possible but perhaps difficult. Much will depend on the amount of time
you have and the scope of the problem you're trying to solve. If you need a
server that can handle a hundred users, it is definitely do-able (starting
with my book code an advanced Java developer should have it polished in a
month or less). Advanced features like clustering, integration into
enterprise resources (LDAP, JDBC, security) will all add to the complexity
of the task.

If you're interested in commercial use and not particularly in developing
your own server, I'm working on a commercial Java Jabber server that will be
available for sale (both for enterprise deployment and OEM use). We'll be
entering early beta in December. Contact me for more information if you're
interested.
