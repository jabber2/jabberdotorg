<PRE>Hi David,

Thats great - I'll try the Exodus daily release or tkabber - I agree
better than having to do restarts. But roommaker was useful to get some
inital rooms up and running.

The config switch probably would be useful where MUC is being used with
custom clients that need more control over the user experience (of
course the client could be made to suppress the message, but the switch
is preferrable).

I'm writing my own client so perhaps I can update it so that its MUC
compliant anyway - what is MUC looking for to assess compliancy - is it
the syntax of the initial room entry command?

</I>MUC
&gt;<i> protocol.&quot;  Though it is informative, in this particular case it will
</I>&gt;<i> confuse our users!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If you are seeing that message, it means that you are using a client
which isn't MUC compliant. As soon as you start using a compliant
client, the message will disappear. The fact that users won't recognise
it was part of the reasoning behind the message - users ask either the
admin or client writer what it means and so try to update to a client
which can make use of all the features. I can write a config switch to
disable this, if you wish.
