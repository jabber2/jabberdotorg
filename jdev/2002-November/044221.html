</I>&gt;<i> Hi David
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your replies. roommaker is now running and creating rooms as
</I>&gt;<i> it should!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few of questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) In Exodus (Win32) I can only see options to enter a conference, which
</I>&gt;<i> creates the room. I can't see any options to determine whether its
</I>&gt;<i> persistent, or even the rooms name (only its JID) or other properties.
</I>&gt;<i> How do I do this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>MUC support in Exodus is available in the Exodus daily releases, until
the next stable release is performed. Check out
<A HREF="http://exodus.jabberstudio.org/daily/">http://exodus.jabberstudio.org/daily/</A> if you want to test one of the
daily releases.

Alternatively, tkabber (A TCL client, available at
<A HREF="http://www.jabber.ru/projects/tkabber/index_en.html">http://www.jabber.ru/projects/tkabber/index_en.html</A>) also supports the
MUC protocol. If you wish to test this, simply grab the file along with
a copy of ActiveState TCL. Its a lightweight, crossplatform client,
which is extendable.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Is there a way to edit or delete rooms in roommaker, or is that
</I>&gt;<i> better to do through Exodus (assuming there is a way to do that - see
</I>&gt;<i> above).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>There isn't a way to remove rooms with roommaker, as it is much better
to be done via a client like Exodus. The reason is that the client
method doesn't require you to restart the service everytime you make a
change to a persistent room. Even rooms created with roommaker require a
service restart, which is why room creation/modification/deletion is
best done via a client.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Is there a way to suppress this message: &quot;this room supports the MUC
</I>&gt;<i> protocol.&quot;  Though it is informative, in this particular case it will
</I>&gt;<i> confuse our users!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If you are seeing that message, it means that you are using a client
which isn't MUC compliant. As soon as you start using a compliant
client, the message will disappear. The fact that users won't recognise
it was part of the reasoning behind the message - users ask either the
admin or client writer what it means and so try to update to a client
which can make use of all the features. I can write a config switch to
disable this, if you wish.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rob
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Regards,

  David
