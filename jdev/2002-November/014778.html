I'm one of the senior developers of phpBB. I've been playing with the 
same idea. Haven't had time to implement this yet. Main reason is that I 
don't want to run jabberd on my main server (on domain.com) to do that 
my client (Psi) first needs to support SRV DNS entries.

When this is done I'm probably going to try to accomplish this. I 
already saw that jabberd can use MySQL for keeping track of things. I 
don't know how trivial it would be to link the phpBB user table with the 
Jabberd process. Of course you could alter profile.php to make it 
insert/delete/update approriate rows when a user creates, deletes or 
alters a username.

BTW you will have to make some modifications to phpBB. You'll at least 
need to limit the usernames that users can't choos (i.e. disallow 
spaces, etc).

Curious if someone else can tell us how (non-)trivial it would be to 
link jabberd to another user database.
