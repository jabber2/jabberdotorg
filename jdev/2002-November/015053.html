<PRE>One other option is to use headers (JEP-33) to do loop detection.

Hopefully once we get disco put to bed, JEP-33 will start to advance again.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>bots) are often not aware of the problem. If they would get 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>information how to handle auto replies in the specs, I'm sure there 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>would be less problems. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think what they need is a better understanding of the concept auto-
</I>&gt;<i> replies. The problem is perfectly avoidable without adding anything to 
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol. So the first step would be fixing the clients so that 
</I>&gt;<i> they're not bugged anymore! As soon as one of the two  clients in this 
</I>&gt;<i> scenario is fixed the problem will become less. But with the solution 
</I>&gt;<i> of extending the protocol both clients have to be fixed, so it will 
</I>&gt;<i> take longer for the problem to go away (if ever). 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Why would *anyone* implement the system the way it is now?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If nobody would implement the system like it is now, why do we then 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have this system? Auto replies have been implemented, that's a fact. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>There is even a (depreciated) server module (mod_filter) for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not saying noone needs autoreply, I'm just saying noone needs 
</I>&gt;<i> autoreply in this horribly implemented way! It's a *bug* in clients to 
</I>&gt;<i> have this kind of behaviour. That's what I would do if I saw such a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem on my server, file a bug report with the author of the client. 
</I>&gt;<i> When auto-replying either do it just once a session, or don't send 
</I>&gt;<i> autoreplies to the same user within 60 seconds. No matter wich protocol 
</I>&gt;<i> extension is used or not used. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> delay before sending out the autoreply! (though thankfully karma 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will slow them down a bit). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>My experience shows that already many messages have been exchanged 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>after karma begins to slow this down. - I don't want to use more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>restrictive karma, as this would also limit legal usage of the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not to mention that (as far as I know?) S2S has no karma limits. In 
</I>&gt;<i> some clients that have this &quot;autoreply problem&quot; (like MICQ) I've seen 
</I>&gt;<i> that they at least wait a few seconds before sending back an autoreply. 
</I>&gt;<i> While this is still a buggy way of doing autoreply it at least doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> flood the network completely. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It could stop itself from sending any more of those confirmation 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> messages on autoreplies of that user within the next 60 seconds or 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> something (as I already suggested).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it would be nice, if this is implemented by a Jabber entity too. But 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>this doesn't meen that you shouldn't flag automatic messages as being 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>automatically created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't care if they implement a time limit or once-a-session. As long 
</I>&gt;<i> as they fix the bug! That should be step 1, I have no objection to step 
</I>&gt;<i> 2 being an extension to the protocol. Just don't expect everyone to 
</I>&gt;<i> support it, and remember that without step 1 you'll still run into 
</I>&gt;<i> problems. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The problem with using some kind of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tag to flag that you don't want an autoreply is that some people 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (who don't like autoreplies) will send it out by default, wich will 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be reason for some client developers (who want their autoreply to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> send anyway) will ignore the tag, wich will bring us back to where 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we started. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Don't be stupid ... I don't think that people send auto replies if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>know that the other side doesn't want them. Why should they? It's not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>spam, they think that it is nice, but I really expect that they would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>accept if somebody doesn't want auto replies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well for one, some just won't implement the extension. But don't expect 
</I>&gt;<i> that just cause some people don't want something other won't either. If 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to have a messenger that sends you an automatic message when you 
</I>&gt;<i> send me one, and you indicate in your message through a tag you don't 
</I>&gt;<i> want one. What is my highest priority, doing what the user of my 
</I>&gt;<i> messenger wants (send the autoreply) or do what the user of some other 
</I>&gt;<i> messenger wants (receive no autoreply). Compare it with the type=&quot;chat&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour that's currently there. Many clients just simply override it 
</I>&gt;<i> to whatever the user wants. I'm not sure if I'd call that stupid. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>but there is a good idea in this: The flag could also express, that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>somebody doesn't want auto replies. Something like this could be the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>syntax: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;x xmlns='jabber:x:autoreply' isautomatic='true' 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>wantautomatic='false'/&gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> type=&quot;autoreply&quot;, or if that's too drastic a tag marking that your 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> message *is* an autoreply (not that you don't want one back).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Please read the messages you have replied to. This is exactly what has 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>been discussed yet: Mark automatic messages as being machine generated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've read them, and I'm just throwing my two eurocents into the 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion with type=&quot;autoreply&quot;. Hope you don't mind ;) 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But the idea that you can flag messages to express that you don't want 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>an automatic reply is interesting too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just to be sure, again, I'm not against this kind of extentions. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I myself lean towards just using type=&quot;autoreply&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> How it works:
</I>&gt;<i> Any message of the type autoreply should be marked with 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;autoreply&quot;. It's not allowed to respond with another autoreply 
</I>&gt;<i> message to this kind of message. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Advantages:
</I>&gt;<i> - simple
</I>&gt;<i> - users that don't want want them can filter them out in their own 
</I>&gt;<i> client or on the server, rather then relying on the other client for 
</I>&gt;<i> not sending them. - clients could present autoreplies to the user in a 
</I>&gt;<i> different way, probably without much change in code. - prevents abuse 
</I>&gt;<i> from people who don't want autoreplies faking it. (since they can't use 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;chat&quot; anymore then) 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantages:
</I>&gt;<i> - less possibilities as with a tag. (at the same time it's an 
</I>&gt;<i> advantage, keeps things simple). - perhaps too much of a change to the 
</I>&gt;<i> core protocol? (how's this for type=&quot;headline&quot;, are you free to use any 
</I>&gt;<i> type you like, or just headline, chat and error?) 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most things could also be done with something like jabber:x:autoreply I 
</I>&gt;<i> suppose, but I kind of like it this way. Anyway, if I'll ever implement 
</I>&gt;<i> autoreplies I'll ofcourse go with whoever wrote a nice JEP for it, it 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't matter all that much to me how. :)
