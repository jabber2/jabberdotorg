<PRE>Okay I'm just posting a follow up to my XHTML post yesterday about
jabber.org eating messages.

I Originally thought it was because of the XHTML I added because thats when
it stopped working, but with the great help from Robert Norris we found out
what was happening.  In my client I had the server set to Nureality.ca and
sending messages used that as the from JID.

&gt;<i>From Rob's description from my understanding is that for s2s it checks if
</I>the from domain is an authorized link in the s2s, if not it drops it.
Basically its treating Nureality.ca not as nureality.ca and dropping it.
Rob found it was a bug in his new jabberd 2 tree, and fixed it there and it
worked, I hard coded it in my client to lowercase the server setting and
Jabber.org is now working again.

Rob and myself feel this is still something that should be fixed in the
Jabber.org SCM, I'm told this is  a component by Jabber Inc.  I would
greatly appreciate if this could be fixed in future versions.  All is fixed
on my end but one can't be too careful.

Thanks to Rob and Peter for the help on tracking down this problem.
