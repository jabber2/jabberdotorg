For the past year, the Trillian forum has received lots of Jabber advocation.  
An old forum poll showed that 50 percent of the voters were interested in 
Jabber.  I even got a few users over there to try some Jabber clients.  
Unfortunately, the whole reason these people switched to Trillian is to avoid 
having to run multiple clients.  Thus, they all ended up ditching Jabber and 
staying with Trillian anyway.

&gt;<i> - Would there be any reason why not supporting Jabber (because I really
</I>&gt;<i> don't see a reason at all, it's the only protocol next to irc that they
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't have to reverse engineer)? A friend of me told me that
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft actually notified Trillian that they would change their
</I>&gt;<i> protocol?? But of course, I don't know if that last one is true.
</I>
I don't know the reason for this.  Now that Trillian has &quot;gone pay&quot;, I'm sure 
they have greater issues to worry about (remember, typical users do not care 
about Jabber).

&gt;<i> - Wouldn't there be some hack to get Jabber into Trillian? I thought the
</I>&gt;<i> developers of Trillian were working on an API or sth. like that, so that
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber could be supported in Trillian.
</I>
This might be possible someday, but they have been promising such an API for 
over a year.  I think even if one existed, it would not do Jabber enough 
justice.  Users are lazy, and Jabber needs to be sitting right in front of 
them as a core component.  But that is just my opinion.
