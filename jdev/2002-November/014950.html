You could try using the MSN2Jabber ( <A HREF="http://www.jabberstudio.">http://www.jabberstudio.</A>
org/projects/MSN2Jabber ) since you can have multiple MSN accounts 
running in Trillian. Don't know if it works and if it does.. it's very 
hacky ofcourse ;) 

I've looked once on their forum, and there was a sticky thread by an 
admin about wich features were on the TODO list, Jabber was on it as 
well (by request). So were a zillion other things. 

On MSN notifying trillian: that's a true story. MSN/Microsoft has 
nowhere near the parania about things like Jabber as for example AOL. 
In fact on an unofficial basis we've talked with them about it and they 
called it a &quot;very intresting technology&quot;. I also believe Jabber inc. 
has a reasonably good relationship with them. (Jabber inc. also offers 
their own MSN transport)
