<PRE>Hi,

on the website of Trillian 
(<A HREF="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/trillian/index.html">http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/trillian/index.html</A>) they say &quot;Connects 
to all major chat networks, including AIM&#174;, MSN&#174;, ICQ&#174;, Yahoo!&#174;, and 
IRC!&quot;, but I don't see Jabber in there. Maybe that I could convince some 
of my friends to switch to Jabber if only Trillian would support it.

- Would there be any reason why not supporting Jabber (because I really 
don't see a reason at all, it's the only protocol next to irc that they 
wouldn't have to reverse engineer)? A friend of me told me that 
Microsoft actually notified Trillian that they would change their 
protocol?? But of course, I don't know if that last one is true.

- Wouldn't there be some hack to get Jabber into Trillian? I thought the 
developers of Trillian were working on an API or sth. like that, so that 
Jabber could be supported in Trillian.


greetings
Mattias
