<PRE>Hi,

According to the current RFC and the bis version, roster pushes are to
be sent to &quot;available&quot; resources that have requested the roster only.
I think it makes more sense to say that roster pushes should be sent
to &quot;active&quot; resources that have requested the roster.

For instance, there would be a scenario wherein an automated client
would be doing roster management without the need to have presence.
It would require to be updated on roster activities without the need
for presence information about contacts.

Another case is when a client representing a user resource &quot;a&quot;
switches from available to active state and another resource &quot;b&quot; adds
a presence subscription to contact &quot;c&quot;.  The server will not send a
roster push to &quot;a&quot; since its not &quot;available&quot;.  &quot;a&quot; subsequently comes
online and the presence information of &quot;c&quot; is received by &quot;a&quot;, but the
client does not process it since it is not aware of the roster item.

WDYAT?

Regards,
Vinod.
