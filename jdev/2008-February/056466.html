Subject: IPv6 @ IETF-71, especially Jabber

What's going on with the preparations to turn off IPv4 at IETF-71?
It's been really quiet surrounding that topic since the initial
discussion.

Because I've had an IPv6 mail server for years and a WWW proxy that
allows IPv6-only hosts to get access to the IPv4 web is fairly trivial
to set up (tip for XP users: XP can't do DNS lookups over IPv6, use
Firefox and configure it with the IPv6 address of the proxy), my
preperation for this has been mostly getting Jabber to work over IPv6.

A while ago I managed to find a public Jabber server that is reachable
over IPv6 (amessage.de with some other domains pointing to the same
server). Unfortunately, the client I generally use, Apple's iChat,
does support Jabber over IPv6 when there is IPv4 connectivity, but
when the system has no IPv4 address it says that &quot;you're not connected
to the internet&quot; and doesn't try to connect over IPv6. Recently I
thought this was fixed but it turned out that the Parallels Desktop
virtualization enviroment sets up a bunch of virtual interfaces with
private addresses, which is enough for iChat to work over IPv6.

Anyway, I started looking for Jabber clients that support IPv6. Most
don't, but there are so many Jabber clients that there is actually a
choice of ones that do. Unfortunately, none of them could connect to
the jabber.ietf.org rooms. I first thought this was because of the
clients, so I didn't keep a list of clients that support IPv6. But it
turned out that this is a problem with my iljitsch at amessage.nl
account on the amessage.de server, which doesn't seem IPv6-related.

So... does anyone know a place to obtain a Jabber account that's
usable over IPv6? I assumed psg.com would be a good candidate, but
even though psg.com has a AAAA record, jabber.psg.com doesn't.
