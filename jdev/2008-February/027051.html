If only.

Another thing I mentioned to Gato, that should probably be said out  
loud.  Our implementation of PEP is going to assume that if you didn't  
send a hash attribute, you aren't interested in any implicit PEP  
subscriptions, so it never does a disco toward that client.  Since  
there really aren't many PEP clients yet, they will just have to  
implement 115v1.5 at the same time they add PEP support.

I suggest that other server implementors consider the same approach,  
to avoid the same sorts of needless disco floods that Armondo is  
describing.
