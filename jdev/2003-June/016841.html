<PRE>I'm no Jabber developer yet, but that doesn't mean I can't have
opinions  :-)

&gt;<i> So I think there are some really nice opportunities there. 
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be nice to instantly be able to chat with other visitors on
</I>&gt;<i> a site about knitting? Wouldn't it be great if you would receive a
</I>&gt;<i> message if something changes on the newssite you normally check
</I>&gt;<i> 10 times a day?
</I>
If the goal is to tell everyone that Jabber is great, chat and news
notifications aren't helping that much. They are great features, but
the users don't know they are using Jabber. Jabber technology is
still hidden.


&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be great if you could add entries to you weblog simply 
</I>&gt;<i> by talking to a bot on your roster? I'm sure we can come up with
</I>&gt;<i> even more (and even more interesting) applications for this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be a LOT more interesting if phpBB could send 
</I>&gt;<i> you an IM when you get a new private message on a board. It
</I>&gt;<i> would be even greater if you could reply to that IM just like you
</I>&gt;<i> would to the private message. But at the moment it's quite a
</I>&gt;<i> disaster to implement a system like that.
</I>
I have exactly the same thoughts as you have. Mostly I've been
thinking of Jabber for notifications. When news have been added
to a site, it be great to either get a notification about this or even
the whole story.

There are many changes on a web site that would be interesting
to send Jabber notifications for. Chat is another user area.

I've also thought about Jabber for network management. I think
it really suites for that. If you have network failures, paperjam in
printer or server being hacked, it'd be great to automatically
get a message about this to 'network-bot' on the roster.


&gt;<i> Yeah, it's a fairly easy thing to do when you have 
</I>&gt;<i> your own webserver. But how many website owners own the server 
</I>&gt;<i> that their sites runs on? How many are allowed to run bots/services? 
</I>&gt;<i> Not that many :D
</I>
As I'm not yet a Jabber developer I don't know what's missing.
So it's actually easy if you have your own webserver? Cool. Now I'm
even more exaggerated to get started  :-)

What you're basically asking for is a slimmed Jabber server that any
user could plug in to their homepage?

I think this is really cool. What docs should I read to get started
with Jabber and to become the 31337 Jabber developer who could
implement this in a day or two?  ;)

Back to serious. I like the idea, but I don't know Jabber inside yet.
You have any books to recommend, guides that aren't 100 pages
long?

Tim
