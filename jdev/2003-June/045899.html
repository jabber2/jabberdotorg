&lt;shameless self promotion&gt;

Gaim's Jabber support definitely isn't the best out there, but it's not
horrible, and we do AIM, MSN, ICQ, Yahoo, Gadu-Gadu, Zephyr, IRC, even
Napster chat, and Trepia support is being worked on for the next
release.

&gt;<i> -) Good looking:
</I>&gt;<i> most of the users are interested in how a client *looks*, not what it 
</I>&gt;<i> *does*: skins, avatars, emoticons,...
</I>
Gaim won't ever be skinned (at least not the GTK+ ui for it, anyways)
but we do have emoticons and avatars/buddy icons (not for jabber yet,
it's on my long TODO).

&gt;<i> -) Localized:
</I>&gt;<i> they want the client in their *native language*, by downloading *1* file 
</I>&gt;<i> to have it all
</I>
Gaim supports 24 different languages/locales, all included in the
default install.

&gt;<i> -) Basic features:
</I>&gt;<i> as I said, most of the users are interested in the looks, not the does. 
</I>&gt;<i> Still, add 1 more feature to it (next to chat, file transfer, presence) 
</I>&gt;<i> and their lying at your feet: file sharing.
</I>
File transfer is the old &quot;standard&quot; in our jabber support, but I'll
definitely implement the new standard when it's finalized.


&gt;<i> What I don't think they (=&quot;most of the users&quot;, not all the users) are 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in is an icq.com-style portal, that's at least what I &quot;feel&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> having to look at any documentation. So, a localized free version of 
</I>&gt;<i> Trillian which supports Jabber...
</I>
Gaim seems to fit the bill, as soon as I can add some of the cooler
features to our jabber support.  

The windows port really is coming along nicely, and as soon as the
drag-n-drop bug in gtk-win32 is fixed, I'll really be pushing Gaim on my
friends, and hopefully talking them into jabber accounts as well.
(Until that bug is  fixed, you can't re-arrange the order of your
contacts)

&lt;/shameless self promotion&gt;
