<PRE>&gt;<i> I did not insist on closing down JabberCentral. The proprietor and owner
</I>&gt;<i> of that site made that decision, though I *did* encourage him to do so
</I>&gt;<i> because the site was WAY out of date and positively confusing to users,
</I>&gt;<i> and he lacked the time to improve it or bring it up to date with modern
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber developments (the site had basically been static since 2000).
</I>
That's not entirely true.  The main thing of value was the client news,
Jabber news, and user posts.  These *were* being updated post 2000, right up
until it was closed down, as I remember the discussion well.  I kept the
section on Yabber fairly up to date, and that wasn't developed until 2001.

&gt;<i> I never owned or ran JabberCentral, though I did write almost all the
</I>&gt;<i> content and posted the news stories and, wow, that sounds familiar.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone is free to create their own end-user sites. Anyone is free to
</I>&gt;<i> contact the owner of the jabbercentral.org domain and offer to take it
</I>&gt;<i> over. I never stopped anyone from doing that then, and no one is
</I>&gt;<i> stopping you from doing that now.
</I>
There were several offers to take over running the site in the forums, and I
sent Justin some IM's and (I think) emails on the subject - with no reply.
The only answer I can remember is that Peter was going to integrate it into
jabber.org and it seemed to be a done deal.

Anyway, that's in the past.  Maybe now there seems to be a demand for
something similar it can be resurrected under the same or different domain.

Michael.
