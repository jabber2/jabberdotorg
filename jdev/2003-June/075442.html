<PRE>iChat does use Jabber (or a variant of it, at least), but only to talk 
to other iChats on the local network using Rendezvous for discovery. I 
don't think they'd switch to Jabber for public usage any time soon. 
First off, they had to pay AOL and get some contract to get AIM support 
in there like they have.. we don't know the details of that contract, 
but I'm willing to bet you that having them use an AIM transport isn't 
acceptable to AOL.
