I find this list really frustrating at times.  We *had* a Jabber End User
site that included polls, client reviews etc and was getting a great deal of
hits - doesn't anyone remember Jabbercentral? - but someone *chough*you
Peter*chough* insisted that it be closed down despite multiple offers to
take over running it.  It was replaced but a small link saying &quot;clients&quot;
somewhere on the left of the jabber.org site, and a page with a handful of
clients and a line of yellow/grey stars.

Your average IM user is going to take one look at jabber.org, and go some
place else.  Users don't care about server code, or developers, or the
Jabber council, they just want to see pictures/screenshots of some clients,
read some reviews, and download a client.

And for those advocating some sort of &quot;Official&quot; client, I would have to
strongly disagree.  All that is going to do is create bad feeling among the
other client developers, and we will end up with more dead client projects.
What we need is an end user friendly site that reviews and rates clients, so
that people can make an informed choice, and client developers can see how
their software rates compared to the competition.  (Yes, like the
Jabbercentral of old)

[Yes - I am having a bad day]

Michael.
