IMO there is a need for a 'JSF-thumbs-up'-portal. The current jabber.org 
site is great for geeks and/or Jabber developers but not for the 
complete newbie. There is just too much technical info there and too 
little step by step instructions. So either there has to be some kind of 
'help the newbie'-section on jabber.org or there has to be some kind of 
end-users jabber portal. A few of my friends went to jabber.org after I 
talked enthousiastically about Jabber but quite a few of them just gave 
up after going to jabber.org. Just too much and too detailed info there. 
People don't want to read a 20 page userguide, they want something to 
download and that's about it :D

Cheers,

BartVB
