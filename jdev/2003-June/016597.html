<PRE>On the subject of hard-to-decipher messages, how about setting up a
large multilingual database of common information/error messages which
client authors can raid?  That would let people put more time into
writing better messages, and would discourage client authors from using
obscure interface designs.  It would also, of course, speed up the
internationalisation of Jabber.

On the website itself, what usage statistics are available on who is
using the website for what?  If there are good logs on the site, there
are plenty of analysis tools available.  IMHO, that has to be the first
step in making the site more user-friendly.

There's also an issue in between the two: Jabber (and OSS in general) do
very well at gaining mindshare among technical types, but not so well at
gaining mindshare among semi-technical and non-technical types who are
good at writing newbie-friendly documentation.  Perhaps a redesign
should be aimed attracting people from those kind of communities to help
out with development?
