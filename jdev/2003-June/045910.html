I've been running it for some time, and haven't seen the leak.  So, it
may be a little hard to track down.

I could do with some indication of conferencing.  When you are part of a
MSN conference you get seemingly individual messages from each MSN
contact, but a message to any one of them appears to go to all.  Not
sure, exactly how this could be done better.
