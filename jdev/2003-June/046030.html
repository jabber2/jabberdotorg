</I>Pleaaaaaaase don't do this :D Do you have any idea how annoying this is 
if you are a european that just arrived in China when you get redirected 
to Chinese versions of a page based on you IP? :D
If people have a problem with the language they should be motivated 
enough to find a site in their own language or to find a switch to 
change the language..

helping
with the creation of a portal and how many people want to translate these
documents.

I just recently registered jabbernl.org to create some kind of dutch 
portal but creating the site itself is part of the fun for me :D

Anyway. Let's first figure out who wants to help with the creation of 
such a portal... If no-one is interested in keeping a translated version 
of 'jabber.net' up to date then it's not worth the extra time and effort 
to create a generic framework. BTW IMO it would be nice if we would have 
at least something up before Trillian hits the road? We should certainly 
have something before the XMPP standard goes final :D
Oh, and is jabber.net available for all this? It's owned by Jabber Inc. 
at the moment.

And maybe we should move this discussion to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">marketing-jig at jabber.org</A> ?

Cheers,
