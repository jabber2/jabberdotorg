<PRE>David, you've just written a description of a browser based portal 
application which we've developed. It uses Autonomy technology to 
provide the agent process and Jabber (as well as other services) 
deliver content. It was like reading my brief!

</I>&gt;<i> particular site (or collection of sites) and then build up a profile

</I>&gt;<i> daily summary of all of the sites I've subscribed to, send me instant 
</I>&gt;<i> allerts when something it thinks I would be interrested in occurs.  
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the functionality it requires is already in the protocol, it 
</I>&gt;<i> just needs a client that can inform a service when a particular link 
</I>&gt;<i> in a headline message has been visited, or possibly the service could 
</I>&gt;<i> just mark links that have been replied to (same message id in headline 
</I>&gt;<i> and reply) as interresting to the particular user.  Anyway, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> thinking out loud here.  The web is getting to the point where it is 
</I>&gt;<i> not easy to filter all of the information that a user may wish to read 
</I>&gt;<i> sensibly using a conventional browser interface, and a Jabber client 
</I>&gt;<i> could be a far better interface for the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the subject of Jabber Vs MSN, I recently asked an MSN-user friend 
</I>&gt;<i> why he hadn't switched, and the answer surprised me.  He said Jabber 
</I>&gt;<i> was too complicated.  It seems that MSN only implements a handful of 
</I>&gt;<i> the features of Jabber, but these are the ones the people actually use 
</I>&gt;<i> (not that they have any real choice if they are MSN users...).  Food 
</I>&gt;<i> for thought.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is, or will be, the Jabber killer application? The one thing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that sets Jabber appart from the rest, the application that makes 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people want to switch to Jabber?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the moment the most important reason to switch to Jabber is the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fact that it's open, but is that enough for Joe Average User? I don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think so. Joe is happy with his MSNM with the nice smileys, the MSNM 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that he didn't even had to install and the MSNM that he already had a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (hotmail) account for :D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Being open, distributed, XML-based, easy to develop for, etc, are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really nice properties of Jabber/XMPP but they are of (close to) zero 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest for the average Internet user out there. So IMO we really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need some thinks that make people want to switch and leave their old 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IM system behind.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Videoconferencing, voice communication, playing games while chatting, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these have all been done already. IMO there we need to do something 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more fundamental which is: Web integration :D I think that this is an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> area where we are already ahead of the pack with the XML based 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distributed network.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Besides Email the web is one of the most important components of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Internet, everyone uses it almost constantly when they are on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Net. So I think there are some really nice opportunities there. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be nice to instantly be able to chat with other visitors 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on a site about knitting? Wouldn't it be great if you would receive a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message if something changes on the newssite you normally check 10 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> times a day? Wouldn't it be great if you could add entries to you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weblog simply by talking to a bot on your roster? I'm sure we can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come up with even more (and even more interesting) applications for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the moment I'm trying to figure out how we can really integrate 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> phpBB with Jabber. Sure, people can send a Jabber message to phpBB 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users with a Jabber account now, or view their vCard. These are nice 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but very trivial features. It would be a LOT more interesting if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> phpBB could send you an IM when you get a new private message on a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> board. It would be even greater if you could reply to that IM just 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like you would to the private message. But at the moment it's quite a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disaster to implement a system like that. Yeah, it's a fairly easy 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing to do when you have your own webserver. But how many website 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> owners own the server that their sites runs on? How many are allowed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to run bots/services? Not that many :D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So this is where WCS (<A HREF="http://oid.jabber.org/?oid=1102">http://oid.jabber.org/?oid=1102</A>) comes in. A 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> component that sends/receives HTTP requests. It's a LOT easier for a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> webmaster to just put a script on the site that receives Jabber 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages than to have a bot running that's constantly connected to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Jabber network.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only problem is that the WCS project has been dead for 2 years. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMO we really need to revive it. It looks like there have been quite 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a few people in the past that have improved/debugged WCS but as far 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as I can tell those patches never reached Jeremie. I think it would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a very good idea if we could make WCS a truely usable component 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that would significantly ease Web integration. This would give Jabber 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite a head start. For example, I'm running a community site with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 8000 computer nitwits, if I could properly integrate that site with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jabber it would be quite trivial for me to convert a very large part 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of them to Jabber. It would ease their communication with both the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> site and the rest of the community. This would be even easier if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there was a free version of Trillian which has Jabber support :D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm, this became a pretty long post. Sorry for that :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The bottomline: Who would like to help with the WCS project? Or, even 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better, who would like to run it? My knowledge of C is just too 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minimal and I also already committed myself to both phpBB.com and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jabbercentral.org site :D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With kind regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
