I think this is a sign of a larger end user problem.  We have no site
that caters to end users, and we have no Jabber setup that caters to
them either.  Where is the interest matching?  Where are the general
chat rooms?  They don't exist.  We need an icq.com type deal for Jabber
if we're truly going to start working on an end user face.  I've wanted
to do a site like that for a while now, but no one else has really
seemed to want it or think it meritted the amount of effort it will take
to do it properly.  I guess the question keeps boiling down to, is this
a major JSF/jabber.org problem?  Are we supposed to foster the end user
community and develop the protocol/system?  I think that's just the tip
of the iceberg for my thoughts, so if you want some more, just ask.
