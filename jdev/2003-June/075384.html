<PRE>*snip*
&gt;<i> For what it is worth, Brett Hutley (who is currently on holiday so I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure if he is up-to-date with the discussion) has made an offer on the list
</I>
Just getting up to date now :)

&gt;<i> to host an &quot;end user&quot; Jabber portal and he seems to have the skills and
</I>&gt;<i> experience, as well as a hosted machine to run it on - so maybe it would be
</I>&gt;<i> worth having a chat with him and seeing if you can help each other out
</I>&gt;<i> before we start duplicating work.
</I>
I have a colocated machine at my ISP with plenty of disk space running OpenBSD, Apache and Zope (<A HREF="http://www.zope.org">http://www.zope.org</A>). For portal-stuff and to make it easy for people to upload content I generally proxy a virtual domain through to the Zope server. That way I can give people access to log in via their browser and upload content. 

If people would rather go PHP instead of Zope, I can just serve the domain through my apache server. On the Apache side of things, I currently have mod_perl support compiled in for scripting. Unfortunately, I haven't built PHP support into my server and it sounds like there are a lot of PHP fans out there :) I can add PHP support when I get back to Sydney next Wednesday, if that is the route people want to go. For myself I've had a lot more experience building dynamic content in Zope or perl (although it's probably about time I did something in PHP).

On the other hand, if you have your own server Justin, and would rather rebuild JabberCentral on that, I'm happy to help on the content-building side.

Cheers, Brett
