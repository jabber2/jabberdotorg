<PRE>I'm not sure I see how this would increase it so much?  You would have
to drastically alter the roster protocol so that groups where stored
external of items so that you had one master list.  Then you'd have to
introduce refs (or keep the names, but what'st he point then?) back to
the master list.  It's fairly trivial to pull in the group names as you
process the roster and keep theme sorted.
