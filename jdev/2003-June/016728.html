I did not insist on closing down JabberCentral. The proprietor and owner
of that site made that decision, though I *did* encourage him to do so
because the site was WAY out of date and positively confusing to users,
and he lacked the time to improve it or bring it up to date with modern
Jabber developments (the site had basically been static since 2000).
I never owned or ran JabberCentral, though I did write almost all the 
content and posted the news stories and, wow, that sounds familiar.
Anyone is free to create their own end-user sites. Anyone is free to
contact the owner of the jabbercentral.org domain and offer to take it
over. I never stopped anyone from doing that then, and no one is 
stopping you from doing that now. 

Along with freedom comes responsibility.
