<PRE>While not an actual solution, the work-around for this I use is to set 
my server up to use a local JUD and also to point at users.jabber.org. 
 I encourage users who wish to have their details made public to 
register with users.jabber.org.  It would, perhaps, be nice if an entry 
in the JUD could be marked as public and then distributed to any other 
Jabber server with which the server on which it is registered came into 
contact.  Some kind of TTL would probably be required to prevent a 
server being flooded with second- or third-hand JUD info, however and it 
would have to be heavily karma-limited.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Let's say that you convince somebody to switch from some other messenger

</I>&gt;<i>my old friend Bob is on Jabber?&quot; She does a JUD search, but doesn't find
</I>&gt;<i>Bob. Unbeknownst to Alice, Bob *does* have a Jabber account
</I>&gt;<i>(&quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at bar.net</A>&quot;). But since the JUDs don't talk to each other, she has
</I>&gt;<i>no easy way to find it, unless she contacts him by other means and asks
</I>&gt;<i>him.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Has anyone thought about creating a centralized user directory? There
</I>&gt;<i>could be an optional s2s component for the server implementations, and
</I>&gt;<i>perhaps a direct c2s protocol that clients could implement, as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If such a project were started, it would be a good idea to fold presence
</I>&gt;<i>into it as well.
