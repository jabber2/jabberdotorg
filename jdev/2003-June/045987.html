&gt;<i> And for those advocating some sort of &quot;Official&quot; client, I would have to
</I>&gt;<i> strongly disagree.  All that is going to do is create bad feeling among
</I>&gt;<i> the other client developers, and we will end up with more dead client
</I>&gt;<i> projects. What we need is an end user friendly site that reviews and
</I>&gt;<i> rates clients, so that people can make an informed choice, and client
</I>&gt;<i> developers can see how their software rates compared to the competition.
</I>&gt;<i> (Yes, like the Jabbercentral of old)
</I>
I understand the position, but I disagree.  Your average general IM user
does not want to make an 'informed choice'.  They want to click on a link
and download a client and have it be a fairly simple and mindless
sign-up-and-get-online process.  I guarantee you if instead of just
downloading AIM from AOL's site, you had to look between reviews and pick
from AIM, DeadAIM, Gaim, Trillian, etc... well, there'd probably be less
AIM users.  And look at MSN...why's it picked up a significant userbase of
late?  Because now it comes preinstalled on Windows and thus is a no-effort
to use.

On top of which, I don't believe the push is for a 'single official
client'.  As I understand it, the push is for a Jabber entry portal -- call
it Jabber.net -- which provides for simple sign-up, and a single place for
tech support for a given client that obscures most of the complexity of
Jabber.  This doesn't mean Jabber.org would say 'this is the official
client,' just that there would be a project to define a useful 'general IM
user' Jabber portal and a client matched to it.

That said, I actually agree that the clients listing on Jabber.org is
pretty shabby.  I do miss Jabbercentral, as it felt more like a community
portal than Jabber.org does.  I just happen to believe that a nice set of
client reviews, screenshots and whatnot serves a different purpose than the
proposed 'general IM user' portal/client. :)
