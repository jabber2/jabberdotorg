<PRE>----- Original Message ----- &gt;
&gt;<i> &gt; [&quot;Official Jabber client&quot;]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On my server Psi is the &quot;official client&quot;. There are downloads that
</I>bundle
&gt;<i> &gt; Psi with fitting SSL certificates for this server, with localization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources and some additional icons. There is a small introduction on
</I>how
&gt;<i> &gt; to set up Psi. So, &quot;Psi&quot; is the &quot;official client&quot; for jabber.fsinf.de,
</I>if
&gt;<i> &gt; you like to say so. Most users of this server use Psi and seem
</I>satisfied.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is exactly the sort of example I meant in terms of an 'official
</I>&gt;<i> client'.  It doesn't have to be for all of Jabber, just for whatever this
</I>&gt;<i> system is.
</I>
Rachel - seriously, drop the term &quot;Official Client&quot; - please.  That is
really going to start pissing off other client developers (starting with
me).  If there is one true thing in the Jabber Community, it is that no one
will ever agree on what client is the best.  Also, calling anything an
&quot;Official&quot; client is going to compound the problem that newbies and magazine
reviews seem to have, where they assume the client from Jabber Inc is the
official one, and make broad statements saying &quot;Jabber can't do...xyz&quot;
because it is not supported by the one client that they reviewed.

If you want to build a website with recomended clients - fine.  If you want
to build a website that is a shrine to PSI/Trillian or whatever, be my
guest.  But any website promoting Jabber in general should be client
agnostic - having multiple clients is one of Jabbers major strengths after
all.

[Snip]

&gt;<i> Because, right now, if a newbie wants to sign up for Jabber, they go to
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber.org.  They find a page with a confusing list of clients, and a list
</I>&gt;<i> of public servers.  And beyond that, they're pretty well on their own
</I>&gt;<i> unless they go and find a FAQ or walkthrough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In contrast, if they go to get ICQ, they find a (very ugly and tangled)
</I>&gt;<i> website
</I>
Well I think we can all agree there :-)

&gt;<i> that lets them download the software, lets them search for people
</I>&gt;<i> by interests and look them up to see 'gosh, is my friend on this system',
</I>&gt;<i> and so on.
</I>
Yes - this is exactly what Jabber is missing.  Even if newbies install a
Jabber client they have no one to talk to and quickly loose interest.  On
ICQ they can join random chats, search for people by interest, search for
old friends etc.

&gt;<i> A portal that has an 'official client,'
</I>
Grrr...

&gt;<i> and help and tutorials for that
</I>&gt;<i> client, and various other features that people expect from an IM portal...
</I>&gt;<i> and which, for example, has servers in different areas, and picks the
</I>&gt;<i> 'best' server for you based on location and signs you up and gives you all
</I>&gt;<i> your login info...  well, that'll be something that I honestly do believe
</I>&gt;<i> will spur jabber adoption.
</I>
Yes - I agree.  Except it has to be client agnostic.

I really think you are underestimating the average user.  Usually they are
sent a link from a friend to the client.  If users can navigate between the
various options of ICQ 2xxx Beta, ICQ Lite, ICQ2GO etc and then have the
motivation to hunt down something like Trillian, I think they can choose
between the 4 or 5 top Jabber clients given some user reviews, screenshots
etc.  There are millions of people using P2P file sharing apps, and have you
seen how many different clients there are now?

Michael.
