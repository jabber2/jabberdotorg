<PRE>Yet more testing done.

	Quick background:  4-5 months ago I went through this same procedure, 
and I was able to build Jabberd with JUD, MU-Conference, and SSL 
support.  I ZIPped all the appropriate files together, with the 
intention of building a Windows installer at some point.  But I had 
'hacked' the solution, and first I wanted to re-do my work cleanly.

	So here I am, 4-5 months later, having cleaned up the Makefiles, etc., 
and the build is working.  But using the -D flag makes Jabberd go BOOM! 
  Interestingly enough, any other flag works, including using -Z with 
several zones listed, works just fine.  So now on to the latest tests.

	First I unZIPped my build from 4-5 months ago (which included the 
cygwin1.dll from that time), and fired it up.  Debug mode worked!

	Second, I took my ZIPped build from 4-5 months ago and tried to run it 
under my current Cygwin install (cygwin1.dll v1.3.22-1).  Same problem 
as my new build.  Hmmmm.

	I then took my new build, and ran it using the older cygwin1.dll. 
Debug mode worked!

	So it seems that something most definitely has changed since I did this 
several months ago.  And the cygwin1.dll seems to be where I need to be 
looking.

	Last comment for now:  I have built Jabberd using the included 
pth-1.4.0 and it worked.  I then uninstalled pth-1.4.0, installed the 
latest pth-2.0.0, and rebuilt and ran Jabberd with that.  So it looks 
like pth is not the issue, as I can even use pth 2.0.0.

	Anyway, any insight into the error message I'm getting would be greatly 
appreciated.  The error message, by the way, is the COMPLETE list of 
messages I get from Jabberd when firing up with -D.  It dies THAT fast.
