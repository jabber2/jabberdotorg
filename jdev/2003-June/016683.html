----- Original Message -----
&gt;<i>From the amount of interest this idea is generating, it sounds like all
</I>&gt;<i>we're missing before this site goes ahead is a volunteer, a server, and
</I>&gt;<i>the nod from Peter.
</I>
Why on earth would we need a nod from Peter to set up a website?

&gt;<i>On the point of client ratings, the next step on from that would be to
</I>&gt;<i>request user comments on the clients, then for someone running the
</I>&gt;<i>site to turn those into feature requests and/or best practice guidelines
</I>&gt;<i>for client developers to look over when dreaming up an UI.
</I>
Forget the UI best practises guidelines.  I wrote such a document years ago
and while I got a lot of good feedback from client developers, the general
opinion of the list was that it was a &quot;Bad Thing&quot; (tm) because people might
take it as an official view of what a Jabber client should look like (and
most clients at the time looked nothing like it).  In the end I decided that
the only real way to show someone what a GUI should look/behave like was to
create a client - which is what I am doing with Marc's help.

The article is archived here if it is of any interest - since the only link
I know of that pointed to it was on JabberCentral I doubt it has had many
hits:  <A HREF="http://www.yabber.org/design/">http://www.yabber.org/design/</A>
