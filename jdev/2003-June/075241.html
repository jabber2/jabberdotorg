<PRE>I'm a bit confused about where this is going...

Are you looking for a development model that will lead to better
transports?  If so, we need to talk about why transport developers are
so thin on the ground, and you should be prepared to turn words into
code (give me a decent Jabber component lib written in C and I'll be all
over it!).

Are you looking for way of making a better user experience?  Different
users want different things, and I still don't see how Jabber can tempt 
users away from all-in-one chat programs like Fire or Trillian without
putting in several times as many developer-hours of work.  That's not to
say that those clients are better, only that they're better suited to
some people's needs.

Are you looking for extremely-long-term ways of getting Jabber to be all
things to all men?  That kind of visionary thinking is useful, but only
if you can deliver the detail needed to make it a reality.  If this is
what you're doing, I suggest you start writing some JEPs.
