&gt;<i> I normally avoid all of the conflicts surrounding JEPs, as I am rather 
</I>&gt;<i> content to implement than to propose. However, in my one year of 
</I>&gt;<i> active participation in the Jabber community, I have watched as 
</I>&gt;<i> proposals for much needed features have been sidelined, retracted, or 
</I>&gt;<i> left for dead because of lack of community concensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point of a community is community, and not competition. In 
</I>&gt;<i> addition, the JEP process, and the XMPP protocol itself, makes it easy 
</I>&gt;<i> to implement a feature and extend it later. Isn't that one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> touchstones of the protocol itself? &quot;Extensible&quot; is part of the name 
</I>&gt;<i> ... it's not just a word or phrase, but rather a methodology for this 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, where am I going with this? I have watched a single, much needed, 
</I>&gt;<i> and frequently requested feature get &quot;reinvented&quot; three times in the 
</I>&gt;<i> space of a year. Rather than trying to make it perfect from the start, 
</I>&gt;<i> let the community agree on the current proposed enhancements as a 
</I>&gt;<i> starting point. This will give the client developers and the users 
</I>&gt;<i> something that works, while not perfect for every need, will meet the 
</I>&gt;<i> needs of 90% of the user base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I stand in an untenable position: having promoted Jabber and XMPP 
</I>&gt;<i> internally to my company, I have to explain that a fundamental feature 
</I>&gt;<i> that every legacy IM system has is absent in Jabber and XMPP. The 
</I>&gt;<i> community needs to support this feature to even be on the same playing 
</I>&gt;<i> field as the &quot;competition&quot; that is already out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is this feature? File transfer. Currently, the community needs to 
</I>&gt;<i> find any major flaw with the existing JEPs mentioned below, and 
</I>&gt;<i> forward them all as a group to last call. These four JEPs will give 
</I>&gt;<i> the Jabber/XMPP users what they really want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, are these JEPs perfect? Probably not. But, then again, neither 
</I>&gt;<i> was SMTP (RFC 822 &amp; 2822). There are many extension RFCs to SMTP to 
</I>&gt;<i> enhance its usability and to add features that are not necessarily 
</I>&gt;<i> used by many systems in the &quot;mainstream&quot;. The JEPs I'm speaking about 
</I>&gt;<i> are:
</I>&gt;<i>   * JEP-0042 Inband Bytestreams (the lowest common denominator for 
</I>&gt;<i> file transfers)
</I>&gt;<i>   * JEP-0065 SOCKS bytestreams
</I>&gt;<i>   * JEP-0096 Stream Initiation
</I>&gt;<i>   * JEP-0096 File Transfer Initiation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With these four, the Jabber community can cover that 90% of the user 
</I>&gt;<i> base. Without them, I'll have to wait out yet another file transfer 
</I>&gt;<i> JEP (or JEPs) to be dissected and argued over. If that is the case, 
</I>&gt;<i> then I can't continue to be a proponent of the Jabber community, 
</I>&gt;<i> because the community is not acting in its best interest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We, as a community, have lost active participants over the course of 
</I>&gt;<i> the year because of petty arguing. We, as a community, cannot afford 
</I>&gt;<i> to lose any more (or anyone at all) at this point. XMPP stands to take 
</I>&gt;<i> over as a &quot;standard&quot; IM protocol. We need to have this capability 
</I>&gt;<i> ironed out and solid when that happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's take these four JEPs, remove any major flaws, add any major 
</I>&gt;<i> omissions, and finalize them now. I can't stand to wait for another 
</I>&gt;<i> complete restart on file transfer, and I'm getting less and less 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to extoll the virtues of the protocol and community when 
</I>&gt;<i> something like this cannot be agreed upon.
