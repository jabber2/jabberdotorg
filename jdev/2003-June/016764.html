<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Can you point me at who is doing work with forum integration?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The people from the Psi forum are working on it ( Invision Power Board
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ), Bart van Bragt here is from phpBB (if he ever finds the time..).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Delphi-forums have done this on commercial basis. Most of us know about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JabberStudio I think (code from that could be reused for portals I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think). I asume Jive have made their smack library with the goal of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; once integrating it with Jive-forums too.. and I've heard more of these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things in the passings..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, integration for Jive Messenger (server), Smack (OSS client
</I>&gt;<i> library), and Jive Forums (as well as Jive KnowledgeBase) is an
</I>&gt;<i> important planned addition to our product lineup. Smack is already
</I>&gt;<i> finding its place in adding IM/Chat to Java websites and we'll be
</I>&gt;<i> releasing an open source JSP-based webchat client that uses Smack (and
</I>&gt;<i> included in it's distribution) soon.
</I>
Thanks for the pointers.  When I have time I will follow up - but what I am
mainly interested in is some sort of simple system for displaying Jabber
presence info on webpages.  This is a feature you can see in almost every
forum system for the big four (ICQ/AIM/MSN/Yahoo) - the icon beside each
user post to show if they are online or not.  From my experience it is very
hard to talk forum/portal web authors into including Jabber support without
this.

Can anyone tell me if someone is working on this for any of the above?

Ages ago I wrote up a proposal to do this via a transport in JEP format
(which Peter wouldn't accept despite my constant nagging) but I have had
little feedback on it or seen any alternative ideas put forward:

<A HREF="http://www.yabber.org/jep/webpresence/webpresence.xml">http://www.yabber.org/jep/webpresence/webpresence.xml</A> (IE6 renders this with
the XSLT - not sure about other browsers)

If we can get a Jabber icon to show up beside even a small fraction of user
posts on phpBB/phpNuke sites then it is going to drastically raise the
awareness of Jabber on the web.

Michael.
