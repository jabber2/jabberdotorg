<PRE>----- Original Message -----
&gt;<i> &gt; Ages ago I wrote up a proposal to do this via a transport in JEP format
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which Peter wouldn't accept despite my constant nagging) but I have had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; little feedback on it or seen any alternative ideas put forward:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.yabber.org/jep/webpresence/webpresence.xml">http://www.yabber.org/jep/webpresence/webpresence.xml</A> (IE6 renders this
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the XSLT - not sure about other browsers)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yea but that proposal made the assumption that every server would run a
</I>&gt;<i> presence component at a fixed address which is not really feasible in the
</I>&gt;<i> real world, and if it wasnt running at that fixed location it wouldnt
</I>work,
&gt;<i> which isnt really very good.
</I>
Yes - this is a problem I admit, but I am in two minds about the best
solution.  Anything other than the assumption that the users server would
serve the presence information to the web means that there is extra work to
do both for the user, and the webmaster supporting the script.  (And this
would make it way more complicated than say ICQ to support on webpages)  The
user has to know what his/her &quot;WebPresence&quot; server is, and enter this data
along with his/her JID.  The person designing the website has to capture
this info and store it somewhere.  Plus this also leave the possiblity of
this information changing (ie someone running a webpresence agent closes up
shop) which then means broken links, and the user having to go back to
everywhere they have registered that JID with and updating the info.

&gt;<i> &gt; If we can get a Jabber icon to show up beside even a small fraction of
</I>&gt;<i> user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; posts on phpBB/phpNuke sites then it is going to drastically raise the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; awareness of Jabber on the web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep I totally agree, but it doesnt look good if you method was used and
</I>half
&gt;<i> of the presence indicators have broken images ;)
</I>
True - there must be a way around that though (I'm open to suggestions).
Some javascript solution, or maybe simply a Yes/No option when the user
registers to say if webpresence is supported.
