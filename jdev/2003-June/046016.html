&gt;<i> Maybe I am - and Rachel can correct me if that is the case - but in the
</I>&gt;<i> context of her previous posts I understand that she was advocating a
</I>&gt;<i> portal site run by the general Jabber community (maybe called jabber.net)
</I>&gt;<i> that would choose one client above all other clients as some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Official&quot; client for Jabber.  This is what I am strongly opposed to.
</I>
Lemme rephrase. :)

I think the JSF's time is best spend improving Jabber, supporting all the
client development, and so on.  I think Jabber.net is more valuable as
something /not/ directly run by the JSF, who should spend their time
elsewhere.  I think this hypothetical Jabber portal is an entirely separate
project, and while it might be nice for it to have the blessings of the
JSF, I do not think it should be an 'official' portal for precisely the
reason you name...no one client should be singled out /by the JSF/ as an
official client.  I see nothing wrong with this /portal/ singling out a
client as the 'official' client (sorry for the terminology) on their page
that you download, which interacts easily to sign up, and which they
provide tech support for.  

I grant you, however, that a Jabber portal may end up representing Jabber
to the end-user community, which could still raise resentment for whatever
reason.  But I think if you have a 'GIU' portal, to reuse earlier
terminology, then to try and provide user guides/help/etc for Psi, Exodus,
Rhymbox, Gabber, Nitro, etc etc etc. -- that's going to be a losing battle.
Give them a single client they can download and use easily, and certainly
put a section on the site that guides them towards other clients, but have
one client built /for this site/ which is simple to use and is targeted
specifically at getting general IM users onto Jabber.

Does that clarify?
