<PRE>+100. 'nuff said. Thats me as a client author, and me as a council member. I'd
like nothing more than to see this finished before a new council is elected.

&gt;<i> I normally avoid all of the conflicts surrounding JEPs, as I am rather

</I>&gt;<i> participation in the Jabber community, I have watched as proposals for
</I>&gt;<i> much needed features have been sidelined, retracted, or left for dead
</I>&gt;<i> because of lack of community concensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point of a community is community, and not competition. In addition,
</I>&gt;<i> the JEP process, and the XMPP protocol itself, makes it easy to
</I>&gt;<i> implement a feature and extend it later. Isn't that one of the
</I>&gt;<i> touchstones of the protocol itself? &quot;Extensible&quot; is part of the name ...
</I>&gt;<i> it's not just a word or phrase, but rather a methodology for this protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, where am I going with this? I have watched a single, much needed,
</I>&gt;<i> and frequently requested feature get &quot;reinvented&quot; three times in the
</I>&gt;<i> space of a year. Rather than trying to make it perfect from the start,
</I>&gt;<i> let the community agree on the current proposed enhancements as a
</I>&gt;<i> starting point. This will give the client developers and the users
</I>&gt;<i> something that works, while not perfect for every need, will meet the
</I>&gt;<i> needs of 90% of the user base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I stand in an untenable position: having promoted Jabber and XMPP
</I>&gt;<i> internally to my company, I have to explain that a fundamental feature
</I>&gt;<i> that every legacy IM system has is absent in Jabber and XMPP. The
</I>&gt;<i> community needs to support this feature to even be on the same playing
</I>&gt;<i> field as the &quot;competition&quot; that is already out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is this feature? File transfer. Currently, the community needs to
</I>&gt;<i> find any major flaw with the existing JEPs mentioned below, and forward
</I>&gt;<i> them all as a group to last call. These four JEPs will give the
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber/XMPP users what they really want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, are these JEPs perfect? Probably not. But, then again, neither was
</I>&gt;<i> SMTP (RFC 822 &amp; 2822). There are many extension RFCs to SMTP to enhance
</I>&gt;<i> its usability and to add features that are not necessarily used by many
</I>&gt;<i> systems in the &quot;mainstream&quot;. The JEPs I'm speaking about are:
</I>&gt;<i>    * JEP-0042 Inband Bytestreams (the lowest common denominator for file
</I>&gt;<i> transfers)
</I>&gt;<i>    * JEP-0065 SOCKS bytestreams
</I>&gt;<i>    * JEP-0096 Stream Initiation
</I>&gt;<i>    * JEP-0096 File Transfer Initiation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With these four, the Jabber community can cover that 90% of the user
</I>&gt;<i> base. Without them, I'll have to wait out yet another file transfer JEP
</I>&gt;<i> (or JEPs) to be dissected and argued over. If that is the case, then I
</I>&gt;<i> can't continue to be a proponent of the Jabber community, because the
</I>&gt;<i> community is not acting in its best interest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We, as a community, have lost active participants over the course of the
</I>&gt;<i> year because of petty arguing. We, as a community, cannot afford to lose
</I>&gt;<i> any more (or anyone at all) at this point. XMPP stands to take over as a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;standard&quot; IM protocol. We need to have this capability ironed out and
</I>&gt;<i> solid when that happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's take these four JEPs, remove any major flaws, add any major
</I>&gt;<i> omissions, and finalize them now. I can't stand to wait for another
</I>&gt;<i> complete restart on file transfer, and I'm getting less and less willing
</I>&gt;<i> to extoll the virtues of the protocol and community when something like
</I>&gt;<i> this cannot be agreed upon.
