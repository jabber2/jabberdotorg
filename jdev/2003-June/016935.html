<PRE>I need both a server and a client. I'm willing to publish and/or use
libraries projects etc. that do the basics of both BUT I have to have a
proprietary namespace and handler object with code that won't be published
(I hope I'm using the verbiage correctly). So everything is pretty standard
fare until the &quot;super secret&quot; message comes flying around. I want to keep
the super secret messages and the handler proprietary.

There are a handful of projects out there that could possibly fit the bill
but I keep coming back to one problem: Is the handling of a new namspace and
the objects required to do so going to be forced into GPL land if I use a
GPL'd client/server/library? And what exactly is the difference between
LGPL, GPL and Apache licenses? I've really read them all but in typical
lawyer speak you can pretty much do anything you want given certain
obsfucations of any of the licenses. The Apache license seems the most
straight forward but is adding &quot;apache blah blah blah&quot; really all that is
needed.

Second, is there a decent Win32 project flying around that would fit the
bill? I'm a C/C++ Win32 guy unfortunately. I would be willing to slug out
some new public code for doing goofy windows nonsense (like IO completions
ports) to boost a win32 server amongst other things as long as I can cover
my initial point above.

Am I smoking crack?

Thanks,

Timothy A. Anderson
