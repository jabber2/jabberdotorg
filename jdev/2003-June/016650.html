Right, the general public does not want to worry about details.  They just 
want to be up and running with minimal fuss.  A similar detail is the choice 
of a server.  They should not be burdened by this.

Yes, this totally goes against the &quot;philosophy of Jabber&quot;, but I think it is 
worth pursuing in order to drive adoption by typical end-users.  We've 
already got the developer, tech crowd, and standards groups covered.  I see 
no problem in exploring other paths at the same time.

&gt;<i> relatively straightforward to use.  They also want the glitzy features...
</I>&gt;<i> after all, if they can voice-chat from their legacy system, why should they
</I>&gt;<i> change to Jabber if it doesn't support it?
</I>
I totally agree here.  I tend to recommend Jabber only to those that have 
minimal expectations of an IM service.  There is still a lot to go..   we 
need the server side privacy lists, the new file transfer and avatar efforts 
to finish, a nice voice chat standard, etc.  To many of us here, these 
features may seem extraneous, but to many general users they are simply par.

&gt;<i> And even the more savvy folks find themselves stuck with legacy systems
</I>&gt;<i> because the less-savvy folks don't change off it.  I have maybe 20 MSN
</I>&gt;<i> contacts, most of whom are family; I'll never be able to dump MSN unless I
</I>&gt;<i> can steer them off of it as well.
</I>
Which is effectively impossible.  I was fortunate enough to have a family that 
didn't use IM at all, so I gave them Jabber and they are happy.  New users 
are easy.  Converting existing users is painful.

&gt;<i> But a single client which deliberately obscures much of the complexity of
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber from people, which provides the AIM, ICQ, MSN and Yahoo transports
</I>&gt;<i> as transparently as possible to get people over to Jabber, which has a
</I>&gt;<i> look-and-feel that makes people feel comfortable with it, and which has a
</I>&gt;<i> single place where people can go to find help on it... that would have
</I>&gt;<i> value in getting folks onto Jabber, too.
</I>
Only one client appears to have this direction: Rhymbox.  However, we still 
need that &quot;single place where people can go&quot; to back it up.  We need a 
reliable free server devoted to end-users, with an easy client that uses that 
server by default.

And yes, powering this service would cost money, and I don't really have a 
solution for that.  The other way to get the masses using Jabber is for AOL 
and MSN to embrace it on their server, but somehow I think finding a sponsor 
for our own user-centric Jabber service would be more realistic.

&gt;<i> There are other ways, of course.  Lord knows we have enough Trillian users
</I>&gt;<i> in our installed userbase, and I'm hoping that adding Jabber into our
</I>&gt;<i> package will at least get some of the Trillian users onto Jabber as well.
</I>
The mass userbase of Trillian cannot be ignored, and I think the inclusion of 
Jabber is critical.  In my personal experience, more folks know about your IM 
client than Jabber!  This is either a sad state of affairs or a unique 
opportunity.  Do us well. ;-)
