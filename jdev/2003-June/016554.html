Trepia is *not* that intelligent.. it just uses some bad geography 
guesswork. It's not picking up people on the local network or anything 
like that.

I've been in off/on contact with some, uh, people who are a bit more 
heavily involved in Rendezvous than jer (if Rendezvous is the impl 
you're thinking of for a JEP), and I'll probably work with them to come 
up with specifics for a JEP for using Jabber over Rendezvous when the 
time is right. I'd say about a month from now. maybe 20 days.

I had some basic commandline stuff going back when Rendezvous stuff 
first came out, but kinda let it slide over the school year. Despire 
Jer's stuff being straight C, I'm probably likely to use that stuff. If 
Jer is thinking of keeping it updated ;)

Anyway, I'd ask that any parties involved in Jabber Rendezvous stuff 
contact me privately for the time being.. at least hold off a little 
bit. It'll be worth it.
