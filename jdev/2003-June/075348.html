This reminds me of a discussion I had recently about Jabber. One of the
things that came up was that a &quot;weakness&quot; of the decentralized nature of
Jabber is that there is no central method for locating other Jabber
users.

Let's say that you convince somebody to switch from some other messenger
to Jabber. She sets up a jid &quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">alice at foo.com</A>&quot;. Then she says &quot;I wonder if
my old friend Bob is on Jabber?&quot; She does a JUD search, but doesn't find
Bob. Unbeknownst to Alice, Bob *does* have a Jabber account
(&quot;<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at bar.net</A>&quot;). But since the JUDs don't talk to each other, she has
no easy way to find it, unless she contacts him by other means and asks
him.

Has anyone thought about creating a centralized user directory? There
could be an optional s2s component for the server implementations, and
perhaps a direct c2s protocol that clients could implement, as well.

If such a project were started, it would be a good idea to fold presence
into it as well.
