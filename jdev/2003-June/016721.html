</I>Of course the JSF can never point out an 'official client', not as long 
as they don't create a client themselfs. But IMO if they would do that 
it would harm their position IMO. It would also make Jabber less open.

The main point in this 'discussion' is the fact that rachel said 
'official client' (mind the quotes!!) while (IMO) she meant; recommended 
client.  IMO the JSF or jabber.net or jabbercentral.com could recommend 
some client for particular user groups (people that need perfect 
interoperation with legacy systems, Mac users, Windows users, people 
that want the bleeding edge).

Anyway. IMO it would be nice if we could take a step back before we are 
going to attack eachother on semantics..  What do we want, where do we 
want it and who is going to create/maintain it? And what does the JSF 
think of this? And eeeh, why is this discussion taking place on jdev? :D 
IMO the marketing-jig is more appropriate..

Cheers,
