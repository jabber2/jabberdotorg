<PRE>&gt;<i> as Trillian Pro will support Jabber through a plugin, I was wondering 
</I>&gt;<i> who is already using Jabber and who will use it. So I started a little 
</I>&gt;<i> poll on the Trillian forum, might be of interest:

I would like to reitterate the question I asked on the marketing-jig 
list a week ago: Do we think the current jabber.org site is sufficient 
for the sudden increase in complete noobs :D

IMO: No. The jabber site contains too much technobabble, information to 
get started is too dispersed or you need to read way too much. IMO 
people just want to get started as fast as possible and they'll come 
back if they want extra info... My proposal: A quickstart guide for 
endusers that uses a few lines to tell how great Jabber really is and 
then it gives the user a few steps they'll have to take to get started.

But I could be wrong I guess. Maybe the current site is already OK and 
am I just underestimating the average Joe...
