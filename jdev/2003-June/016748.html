<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Something that might be worth considering is setting up a central site
</I>like
&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;jabber.net&quot; but when people visit that their location could be
</I>determined
&gt;<i> &gt; using the IP to Country system <A HREF="http://www.ip-to-country.com/">http://www.ip-to-country.com/</A> like
</I>PHP.net
&gt;<i> &gt; does for its downloads and automatically direct the user to their local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; portal
</I>&gt;<i> Pleaaaaaaase don't do this :D Do you have any idea how annoying this is
</I>&gt;<i> if you are a european that just arrived in China when you get redirected
</I>&gt;<i> to Chinese versions of a page based on you IP? :D
</I>&gt;<i> If people have a problem with the language they should be motivated
</I>&gt;<i> enough to find a site in their own language or to find a switch to
</I>&gt;<i> change the language..
</I>
It might be an inconvenience to you but it could well be a great benefit for
the rest of the people in that country, plus once a user has been sent to
the appropriate site and they bookmark it it will bookmark the local portal
and not jabber.net, so even if you do goto another country when you click
the bookmark you have made to get to your portal it will go to your portal
and not the chinese or whatever one. This is just an extra way of making it
easier for the general user to find out about and register for jabber and
being on a localised portal will hopefully make it a much more comfortable
experience for them. Do you really expect these users to be able to hunt
down a localised portal that they dont even know exists??

&gt;<i> &gt; It would probably be good also if there is a basic starting framework
</I>(as
&gt;<i> &gt; already suggested) that community jabber sites can be quickly built with
</I>if
&gt;<i> &gt; someone wants to quickly start one up, including the basic stuff for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; registering, integrated forum, news, client selection etc etc, which
</I>people
&gt;<i> &gt; can build upon and customise.
</I>&gt;<i> IMO it would be smart to first find out which people are interested in
</I>&gt;<i> helping
</I>&gt;<i> with the creation of a portal and how many people want to translate these
</I>&gt;<i> documents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just recently registered jabbernl.org to create some kind of dutch
</I>&gt;<i> portal but creating the site itself is part of the fun for me :D
</I>
Fine but it could still be of use to others that dont want to duplicate work
that has already been done.

&gt;<i> Anyway. Let's first figure out who wants to help with the creation of
</I>&gt;<i> such a portal... If no-one is interested in keeping a translated version
</I>&gt;<i> of 'jabber.net' up to date then it's not worth the extra time and effort
</I>&gt;<i> to create a generic framework. BTW IMO it would be nice if we would have
</I>&gt;<i> at least something up before Trillian hits the road? We should certainly
</I>&gt;<i> have something before the XMPP standard goes final :D
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and is jabber.net available for all this? It's owned by Jabber Inc.
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment.
</I>
I was not saying that translated versions need to be kept up to date
centrally, just a basic framework of tools that webmasters can use to build
upon, put together and localise to their preferences more quickly and easily
than having to go off and find or code those parts themselves, e.g. a jabber
integrated forum, latest news list, client selection wizard etc etc, I dont
see the point in building a fixed site that all people can do is localise
and brand, just to give people a helping and and kick start.
