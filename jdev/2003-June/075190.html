Either I misunderstand you or you misunderstood me. That's exactly what I
meant: I don't say &quot;let's make jabber.org more colorful!&quot;, I say &quot;the way
to go is to make the major Jabber servers more user friendly&quot;.

Take a look at the WWW pages of the Jabber server listed on
<A HREF="http://www.jabber.org/user/publicservers.php">http://www.jabber.org/user/publicservers.php</A>

Most servers do not look user friendly at all from a &quot;WWW&quot; point of view -
no information on the web sites, no client downloads, some even don't have
an easy-to-find website at all... I think *that's* a problem, not
jabber.org being a bit technical (in fact I think it presents a very good
mix and is easy to navigate so absolutely no need to change jabber.org's
basic WWW design [again]).

Perhaps it would be a good idea to have some kind of quality requirements
for a Jabber server to be listed in the public servers list. As a start, I
don't think it's good to have sites listed there that don't run a decent
WWW page at all. Another requirement could be that there should be links
to the User Guide/General FAQ/End-User FAQ (time for i18n). Or, as a
start, removing defunct servers from the list would also be good ;-). I'll
try to contribute a bit to make the list better.

Regards
