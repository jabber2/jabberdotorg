<PRE>Hi Brett,

&gt;<i> &gt; to host an &quot;end user&quot; Jabber portal and he seems to have the skills and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experience, as well as a hosted machine to run it on - so maybe it would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worth having a chat with him and seeing if you can help each other out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before we start duplicating work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a colocated machine at my ISP with plenty of disk space running
</I>&gt;<i> OpenBSD, Apache and Zope (<A HREF="http://www.zope.org">http://www.zope.org</A>). For portal-stuff and to make
</I>&gt;<i> it easy for people to upload content I generally proxy a virtual domain
</I>&gt;<i> through to the Zope server. That way I can give people access to log in via
</I>&gt;<i> their browser and upload content. 
</I>
Thank you for the offer, but I presently have the resources to host the
site.

&gt;<i> If people would rather go PHP instead of Zope, I can just serve the domain
</I>&gt;<i> through my apache server. On the Apache side of things, I currently have
</I>&gt;<i> mod_perl support compiled in for scripting. Unfortunately, I haven't built PHP
</I>&gt;<i> support into my server and it sounds like there are a lot of PHP fans out
</I>&gt;<i> there :) I can add PHP support when I get back to Sydney next Wednesday, if
</I>&gt;<i> that is the route people want to go. For myself I've had a lot more experience
</I>&gt;<i> building dynamic content in Zope or perl (although it's probably about time I
</I>&gt;<i> did something in PHP).
</I>
If I end up reviving JabberCentral I will likely be using Java (Struts).
I much prefer developing web appliications using Struts over using PHP,
for many reasons.  However, this depends on how many people want to
become involved with the site.  So far I've only heard from one person
interested in helping out on the backend, and your offer (below) to help
with content is the second for front-end.

&gt;<i> On the other hand, if you have your own server Justin, and would rather rebuild
</I>&gt;<i> JabberCentral on that, I'm happy to help on the content-building side.
</I>
This would be very much appreciated.

Justin
