<PRE>Well, my last few posts trying to get some tech feedback have been 
fruitless, so maybe this will be appealing to someone.

	In short, I have modified ./configure, ./cygwin/setup.sh, and several 
of the 1.4.2 distro's Makefiles.  End result:  You can now build Jabberd 
under Cygwin as you do under any other OS.  That means full support for 
the --enable-ssl flag for those so inclined.

	I did the same to the Makefiles of JUD v0.4, MU-Conference 0.5.2, and 
xdb_sql v1.3, and they, too, all build under Cygwin now as well.

	Note I did NOT make a single change to the source code of any of the 
modules.  All I did was clean up the Makefiles, have all the modules 
point to ./cygwin/dllinit.c (as opposed to the way ./cygwin/setup.sh 
copies dllinit.c all over the place), and adjust setup.sh accordingly 
NOT to copy around any Makefiles, but only to overwrite the ./dnsrv 
subdirectory.  Sorry, I couldn't get around Cygwin's limitations in that 
regard, so dnsrv remains as it was in the 1.4.2 distro.

	I haven't finished testing everything, and as I noted in my earlier 
tech postings, the -D flag is causing jabberd to blow (though I found 
using -Z with the essential zones works just fine).  So this means no 
ability to run in debug mode until I can get some help tracking down 
what happened there.

	However, short of that, this would make Jabberd's distribution a little 
more uniform, and bring jabberd closer to the Windows community.  I will 
contact the maintainers of jabberd, JUD, and MU-Conference once I'm 
confident the one issue I'm dealing with is not from my adjustments. 
I have no idea if they'll have any interest in what I've done, but 
regardless, if anyone else out there would like these files, just let me 
know.  [For those paranoid about what I've done, and working in a 
Windows environment, I suggest WinMerge (another SourceForge project) to 
compare the distro files to mine.  You'll see all I'm doing is either 
adding variables like $(LDFLAGS) to lines that were missing them, or 
making conditionals for compiling under CYGWIN, and nothing more.]
