Same story here, my sister saw me chatting with Rhymbox once and I 
showed her all the emoticons. Although she knows what Jabber is all 
about, she was more interested in those emoticons then in what Jabber 
stands for... strange, but it happens all the time with end users. But, 
to be honest, she's using MSN Messenger again, the groupchat didn't 
worked well enough and she missed file transfer.

&gt;<i> Hmm, maybe we could push the free Trillian as the recommended client to 
</I>&gt;<i> new users when (if?) that version supports Jabber? :D
</I>
I'm also considering such a &quot;plan&quot;... I've read on forums of Trillian 
that the free version will support Jabber in the future, but what if 
they don't? And I don't want to purge friends to use an illegal version 
of Trillian Pro...
