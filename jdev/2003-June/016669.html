</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Are you looking for way of making a better user experience?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Different users want different things, and I still don't see how
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Jabber can tempt users away from all-in-one chat programs like Fire
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or Trillian without putting in several times as many developer-hours
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of work.  That's not to say that those clients are better, only that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they're better suited to some people's needs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is the key point, right here.  Jabber's transports have a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good, beneficial feature for people who don't need more than basic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messaging; the ability to store your legacy IM userlists and account
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> info on the server, so that you only ever need to provide your jabber
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> login and voila, you're on everything.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is countered by the fact that the average IM user, who you want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spur to adopt Jabber, does not care about that as much.  Your average
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IM user is probably using the system from one computer; my dad only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ever logs onto MSN Messenger from his own computer, so he wouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> care about multiple systems.  What he does care about is the ability
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to pull my sister-in-law and I into group-chats on MSN, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ability to send files to us over it.  Jabber with an MSN transport...?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if I get him to go 'ooh, pretty' at Rhymbox, there's no way I'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get him onto 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jabber if he couldn't have working group-chats and file transfers to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> his existing contacts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly.. I agree with Rachel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>:<i>
</I>:<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't need one big portal for this. We'll need good Jabber servers
</I>&gt;<i> ofcourse. I don't think portals are a bad idea but personally I believe
</I>&gt;<i> more in local portals. Just call it the polish model ;) Everyone who
</I>&gt;<i> will &quot;switch on&quot; a Trillian user onto the Jabber network will know a
</I>&gt;<i> server what server is good for that Trillian user (they use it
</I>&gt;<i> themselves ofcourse).
</I> 
An option could be to target ISPs so they can provide a multi-transport
service to their customers.

Why? ISPs (apart from AOL) have very few vehicles to maintain awareness but
a giveaway IM skinned with their branding connected to their servers would
be a very useful and sticky feature. The local portal route.

I am keen to see Jabber as the enabling technology for intercommunication -
the next level on the IP stack  as it were - not have it relegated to just
another Chat community, which is what client-side transports imply.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, I think a lot user will switch to using Jabber, at least
</I>&gt;<i> alongside other networks, wich will make things a lot easyer for those
</I>&gt;<i> of us that want to use a Jabber client that does not include client-
</I>&gt;<i> side MSN/ICQ/etc. implementations like Trillian. Ofcourse, users of
</I>&gt;<i> such messengers still have a bigger reach than Jabber-only messengers,
</I>&gt;<i> but that's the whole idea behind such messengers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber will never &quot;win&quot; in a marketing battle, nor can we use an OS
</I>&gt;<i> monopoly to force our client on users. But with a mix of good servers,
</I>&gt;<i> local portals, and just as critically, decent support for Jabber in the
</I>&gt;<i> multi-protocol clients, we can reach a &quot;critical&quot; mass, where
</I>&gt;<i> competition will be more on features and possibilities. And I think we
</I>&gt;<i> *all* agree that Jabber with it's advantage of being an open standard
</I>&gt;<i> that is open for use can have a big lead on the competion when it comes
</I>&gt;<i> to that. 
</I>
I would say that I have almost all buddies on MSN and Yahoo. All have moved
off ICQ (where I too started) and none are on AIM!
