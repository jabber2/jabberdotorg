The bandwidth used is only a waste if you don't like the feature.
Everything on the internet &quot;wastes&quot; bandwidth in someones opinion, it's just
a matter of benifits outweighing the bandwidth usage.  Jabber is a prime
example of this since it sends everything in &quot;bloated&quot; XML - but in my
opinion the trade off is worth it.

&gt;<i> Beyond that it is very prevalent mechanism for spread viruses
</I>&gt;<i> and other malignant items.

True.  Same can be said about the web.

&gt;<i> There is no good reason to use HTML in
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail.  Anything and everything that can be conveyed in an HTML e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> can be conveyed in plain-text and other formats as well if not better.
</I>
That is obviously complete crap.  If that was true the web would use ASCII.

This is getting way off topic - so this will be my last post on the topic.
Just to reiterate, I'm not advocating that HTML mail on the list is a good
idea (notice I always send ASCII messages when I remember), I was just
taking issue with the unfriendly tone in which it was communicated, and I
can't see any good reason why HTML can't be filtered by mailman (see FAQ #5
<A HREF="http://www.list.org/faq.html">http://www.list.org/faq.html</A>) so that people don't have to reconfigure their
email client because of Peters preferences.

&gt;<i> &gt; After all &quot;change clients&quot; is the only response I got when I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to figure out how to stop Outlook Express displaying mail from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever-cursed-client sends all those PGP messages to the list that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; show up as .txt file attachments.  (If I want to read them I have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open each one up in Notepad...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is a flaw in Outlook Express, not with the message being sent.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a cause of comparing Apples and Oranges.
</I>
Be that as it may - thanks Andrew and others (Rachel) I can now read your
posts without having to go into Notepad!

Michael.
