I agree, much more is needed than just an easy user guide. If we really
want to reach the average IM user, we need an icq.com-style portal that
makes users happy by providing general-interest chatrooms, easy ways to
find like-minded users, fun little quizzes and polls, games, and all
that jazz. I don't think this is something that the JSF would excel at,
so I doubt that it's a good focus for the JSF. But I do think that this
would take Jabber to the next level. People are offering Jabber-based
consumer services (nioki.com, etc.), but there is no &quot;human face&quot; to the
Jabber movemement. All I know is, it will be a lot of work to create and
maintain such a service. :)
