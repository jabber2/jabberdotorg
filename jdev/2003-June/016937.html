<PRE>Depending on what you are doing, you may not need server support.  If 
you don't then your best bet is probably to take a copy of the Jabberd 
source (which I think builds under cygwin, although windows is not a 
supported platform) and tidy it up so that it runs nicely under 
cygwin/mingw.

To sumarise the licenses:

The GPL is the most restrictive.  You can do anything with GPL'd code, 
but if you distribute products based on it then:
1) You must include the source.
2) You must distribute it under the GPL.
This basically means that anyone who gets to use your software has 
exactly the same rights over it as you did over the code you used as a 
base.  If you don't distribute the code (you keep it in-house) then the 
GPL is fine. 

The LGPL states (more or less) that the license itself is distributed 
under the terms of the GPL.  Any changes you make to the library must, 
if distributed, include source and be licensed under the LGPL.  You may, 
however, link to the library without making your code (L)GPL, as long as 
you allow people to change the version of the library they use.  If you 
dynamically link, this is no problem.  If you statically link you must 
include your .o files so that people can re-link if they wish.

The Apache license is a modified BSD license.  Basically you can do 
anything with the code except:
1) Sue the people who wrote it if it goes wrong
2) Claim you wrote it.
3) Call your program after the one you copied.
You must make sure that the copyright notices are placed in the source, 
and distributed with any binaries and in any documentation.  Beyond that 
you can do whatever you like with the code. 

If you are really lucky, you may find the code you're looking for under 
the MIT license, which is even more lenient.  This only states that you 
must acknowledge copyright in the source.  If you distribute a binary, 
you don't have to bother (although it is considered polite to do so).  
About the only thing I can think of that uses this license is XFree86.

Hope this helps.
