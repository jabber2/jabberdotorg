<PRE>Perhaps this approach could be used in another way.  

Allow anyone to register an account (we can't enforce registration 
conditions on every server anyway).
Accept messages from people on your roster automatically.
For anyone new, use a challenge-response mechanism as outlined by Mattias.
    - A new contact is sent a link to an image in OOB data.
    - The new contact must reply to the message with a message 
containing the contents of the image.
    - Only after the message from the new contact has been authenticated 
should the original message be delivered.  If the response is not 
authenticated then the server should generate an error.

This would prevent people from easily sending a large number of spam 
Jabber messages, although it would have a couple of  limitations:
Blind people obviously can not see an image, and so could not recognise 
it.  An alternative, such as a wave sound of someone saying a word / 
phrase or number could be used in place.  This then leaves us with the 
problem of blind and deaf people, who, presumably are using some kind of 
braille terminal.  It would be very difficult to create something which 
can be recognised by someone using a braille terminal but not a computer.
Low bandwidth devices and terminal based clients may also be unable to 
respond to this kind of identification.
