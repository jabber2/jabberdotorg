No, I don't want one central server for all of Jabber. Each server would
still maintain its own local directory. And participation in such a
superJUD would be completely voluntary. It would just be a convenient
&quot;value-add&quot; to Jabber's usability.

Sure, something similar to the P2P systems might be good.

Decentralization is a strong point for Jabber. But J. Random User
doesn't care about that. He says &quot;when I used ICQ, I could search for
other ICQ users, and I didn't have to worry about what server they were
on.&quot; I'm not saying that a centralized JUD necessarily should be part of
the official Jabber effort. I'm just saying that it could be a useful
additional service, if somebody wants to set something like that up.

PGM mentioned some sort of precence bcc feature that I'm not familiar
with. I don't have time to look into it right now, but I'll try to do so
later.
