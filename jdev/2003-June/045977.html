HTML e-mail is *far* from a standard.  There are several reason not to
use it not a single reason to use it.  HTML e-mail bloats the size of
any message to at lease double (unless you send HTML only, which is even
worse).  Beyond that it is very prevalent mechanism for spread viruses
and other malignant items.  There is no good reason to use HTML in
e-mail.  Anything and everything that can be conveyed in an HTML e-mail
can be conveyed in plain-text and other formats as well if not better.

That is a flaw in Outlook Express, not with the message being sent.
This is a cause of comparing Apples and Oranges.
