<PRE>I turned a year older today. And Gabber turned a generation older.

--------------------
Quick summary:
Gabber 2 (1.9.0 preview) release tarball *will* be at:
<A HREF="http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/releases/">http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/releases/</A>

Gabber 2 forums can be found at:
<A HREF="http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/forums/">http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/forums/</A>

Gabber 2 mailing list can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/mailinglists/">http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/mailinglists/</A>

Gabber 2 web site will be:
<A HREF="http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/">http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/</A>
--------------------

As many of you may have suspected/known, temas and I have been working 
on Gabber 2. This version is almost entirely rewritten. Yes, that means 
it lacks most of Gabber 1's features. Also note that the new big coder 
on Gabber 2 is Temas. Everyone thank Temas. I guess I stole him away 
from aim-t, though (don't hate me).

In a few hours, a preview release, 1.9.0, will be available for 
download from <A HREF="http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/releases/">http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/releases/</A>

With Gabber 2, we're moving away from sourceforge and all of the 
related Gabber 1 stuff. The new web site is at: 
<A HREF="http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/">http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/</A> -- right now it's empty, but over the 
coming weeks I'll put together a new site to go there.

With Gabber 2, we'd like to try to be a bit more in touch with our 
users than we have been with Gabber 1. To that end, Temas has set up 
forums: <A HREF="http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/forums/">http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/forums/</A> and we also already have 
the new mailing list for Gabber 2 set up, which can be subscribed to 
from this address: 
<A HREF="http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/mailinglists/">http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/mailinglists/</A>

No discussion about Gabber 2 should take place on the Gabber 1 mailing 
list (@lists.sourceforge.net). No Gabber 2 bugs should be filed on the 
sourceforge page. Gabber 2 bugs and feature requests may be filed on 
the JabberStudio page: 
<A HREF="http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/project/view.php">http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/project/view.php</A>

Gabber 2 requires libsigc++ 1.2, gtkmm 2.0, gconfmm 2.0, and libglademm 
2.0. Red Hat users, you'll be amazed to find most of these on 
freshrpms.net. :)

Gabber 2 *CANNOT* be installed simultaneously with Gabber 1. The second 
you type 'make install' you are overwriting your Gabber 1 binary. If 
you wish to 'make install' Gabber 2, then be kind to your system and 
uninstall Gabber 1 first (otherwise you'll have a lot of useless files 
lying around). Should you choose not to 'make install' Gabber 2 (as 
would be the wise thing to do, as it is far from a 2.0 still), Gabber 2 
will run just fine as ./src/gabber from within the source directory. 
Just be sure you 'make install-schemaDATA install-data-local' so that 
Gabber's GConf data is properly installed.

The 1.9.0 tarball is not available yet, as temas and I are doing last 
minute preparations. It should be pretty clear that this is not feature 
complete at all yet, but you can perform basic Jabber actions.

Gabber 2 is available in JabberStudio CVS as modules 'jabberoo' and 
'gabber'

Thanks
Julian
