<PRE>&gt;<i> 1) jabber.net - mainstream IM service (a.k.a. Jabber Open IM Service, 
</I>&gt;<i> a.k.a. 'Jabber').
</I>Sounds like a good plan..

Once the compliance program is ready it become a lot easier to steer the 
newbies towards the most popular clients. It's also fairly easy to just 
provide them with download counts for the last month or short 
reviews/comments of users of a particular client.
At the moment choosing a client is quite difficult when you have no clue 
what Psi is :D

IMO the site doesn't have to be a complete community site. I have used 
ICQ for quite a few years now but I've been on icq.com approx twice? :D 
We should concentrate on getting the users started, helping them with 
problems and maybe updating them on the latest jabber news. I think 'we' 
should stimulate other sites to integrate their community services with 
Jabber. Other people/sites are much better in providing community 
services, they have been doing that for years now.

So IMO it would be a very good start if the site contained:

- Quickstart guide with a kind of 4 step plan (download client, choose 
server, register, configure client)
- Message board which includes some forums for the most populair 
languages. This could be phpBB ofcourse :D I'd be more than happy to 
help with the Jabber integration.
- Knowledgebase/FAQ/whatever that helps people when they run into problems
- Useful and up to date list of clients
- Useful and up to date list of servers

That's it IMO...
