<PRE>Hi,

I will react to several e-mails at once, with the help of some ruthless
copy &amp; pasting.

Note also the Call for DevRooms is now out too:
<A HREF="http://fosdem.org/2010/call-developer-rooms">http://fosdem.org/2010/call-developer-rooms</A>

Dave Cridland:
&gt;&gt;<i> The question is: will we hold the XMPP Summit at the same time (&#177;2 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> days?).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It worked surprisingly well last year, with events before and after. 
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing I would say is that it works best when we've problems 
</I>&gt;<i> we're aiming to solve.
</I>
Peter Saint-Andre:
&gt;<i> More hacking, less talking! :)
</I>
I think we need to choose between what to do in a DevRoom (if we get
any) and what to do in a separate event before or after Fosdem. I can't
judge how many people attending Fosdem would like to participate in a
XMPP-hacking event. It might be worth to give it a try.

&gt;<i> How about a few &quot;tracks&quot; for people who want to hack on specific 
</I>&gt;<i> codebases / in specific languages. Examples:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Python Hacking for XMPP (SleekXMPP, Twisted, etc.)
</I>
Might be interesting, there will be a lot Python-literate developers
around, an hands-on track on it might worth a try. Maybe interesting to
hook up with a Python DevRoom on this?

&gt;<i> 2. Building an XMPP Server in Lua (Prosody)
</I>
Seems a bit specialistic to me, although it might be interesting for a
presentation.

&gt;<i> 3. Erlang, XMPP, and You (ejabberd)
</I>
Or debugging erlang ;-)
Some in-depth knowledge here might be very useful...

&gt;<i> 4. Improving XMPP Support in the World's Most Popular IM Client 
</I>&gt;<i> (Pidgin) 5. Psi Bug Squashing and Feature Enhancements
</I>
Will there enough Pidgin or Psi developers (or people willing to improve
it) around at Fosdem to get this going? I have no idea... And maybe this
is mere suitable for a private event on the days before or after.

&gt;<i> We could also do interop testing among various codebases.
</I>
Also seems quite specialistic to me, maybe better for the days before or
after Fosdem.

Nicolas V&#233;rit&#233;:
&gt;<i> Maybe we could also bring love and attention to PubSub and Jingle.
</I>
A second JingleTingle and a PubSubDub ;-)

Has the e2e encryption / XTLS work advanced enough to do an e2e security
sprint around Fosdem?

Dave Cridland:
&gt;&gt;<i> I think we should apply for a Stand + Devroom, and we could maybe 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get a list of people who want to do some main tracks / lightning 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talks at FOSDEM too?
</I>
&gt;<i> The talks are pretty useful to get wider, more mainstream, interest 
</I>&gt;<i> in XMPP, and to talk about things which aren't really core standards 
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be up for doing one. I've a few ideas for some interesting things
</I>&gt;<i>  to talk about. (Well, interestingish. For some people.)
</I>
The main-tracks are aiming at blocks of three talks around one theme:
<A HREF="http://fosdem.org/2010/call_for_main_tracks">http://fosdem.org/2010/call_for_main_tracks</A>

Filling a main track, would be great exposure for XMPP, but do we think
we can sensibly fill three hours with technical XMPP stuff? Or should we
try to combine with some other project(s)?

Topics that might be interesting to present at large at Fosdem are:
- BOSH (how it works, getting started with it)
- Extending XMPP
- PubSub
(The theme would then become something like: 'Creating the real time web
with XMPP')

Dave Cridland:
&gt;<i> I could also do a lightning introduction to XMPP, that might be quite
</I>&gt;<i>  fun. (I actually have such a presentation kicking about, although 
</I>&gt;<i> it's very much Isode related, so I'd have to doctor it a bit to make 
</I>&gt;<i> it neutral).
</I>
Does it fit into 15 minutes? A lightning talk with fun would be great.

Florian Jensen:
&gt;<i> I think we should apply for a Stand + Devroom, and we could maybe get
</I>&gt;<i> a list of people who want to do some main tracks / lightning talks
</I>&gt;<i> at FOSDEM too?
</I>
Maybe we should create these lists on the Wiki?

Do we have enough volunteers to man a stand? I will be running around
too much at Fosdem to man the stand, but maybe others will have some time.

&gt;<i> I'd be up for helping out with the organization of all FOSDEM related
</I>&gt;<i> stuff.
</I>

Great, thanks Florian! As long as I have my hands free to run around at
Saturday and Sunday, I am willing to help out a bit too.

Winfried
