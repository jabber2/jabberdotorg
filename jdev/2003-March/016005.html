<PRE>Hi,

I'm the main developer of a project named JPT (Jabber for Wireless
Terminals). You've propably read about it in the newest Jabber Journal.
Currently we are prepairing the 0.3.1 release supporting SSL connections to
Jabber servers (only on PHP 4.3.0 or later), and other than Unicode
encodings (requires Multibyte String library in PHP). All of this stuff is
done already, but there is one thing more to be done - 0.3.1 should be
released with cHTML frontend for iMode phones. I have written a prototype of
the cHTML code, but I need to test it. As I'm not living in a country where
iMode is available, I need someone elses help. One should be able to access
the cHTML frontend simply by entering the demo site:
<A HREF="http://jpt.jabberstudio.org/jpt_demo.">http://jpt.jabberstudio.org/jpt_demo.</A> I would be very greatful If anyone
could test it and tell me wether it works. I think that there are some iMode
phones not supporting Java, so it might be a good idea to let those folks to
access Jabber from their mobiles.

There is also one thing that links to it. As I'm prepairing this frontend
for iMode phones that - as far as I know - are very popular in Japan, I
think that it would be very helpful for Japanese users if JPT would be
translated into Japanese. If anyone feels like translating, please contact
me here or directly by e-mail at <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jstar at starzaki.eu.org</A> and I'll send an
sample version of the default English language file. JPT allows sending
pages in Shift-JIS, so there shouldn't be any problems with the
compatibility of the cell phones.

Jan &quot;JStar&quot; Starzak
