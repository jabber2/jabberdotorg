<PRE>Can someone explain what happens when a client violently disconnects from a 
Jabber server? My understanding is that the server senses the broken 
connection and sends a &lt;presence type=&quot;unavialable&quot;/&gt; on behalf of the client 
to all interested parties. My question is how does the server know which 
parties are interested? In particular how is the user removed from a group 
chat room?

We've been looking at the case where we need to remove a user as a member 
from a members-only room when the user disconnects. The user may or may not 
have joined the room at the time of the disconnect.

Thank you,
Christopher Helck
