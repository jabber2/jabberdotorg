<PRE>1) I'm not a JabberBeans developer so hopefully someone else on the list
can point you in a good starting direction.  Of course read through the
docs they've provided and sifting through their source code are two
great places to start.  I have another Java library called Yaja! that
you might also consider ( <A HREF="http://yaja.sourceforge.net">http://yaja.sourceforge.net</A> ).
 
2) Firing up a Jabber server is very straight forward on either Windows
or many of the Unix variants.  There is now the Quickstart package which
should make it even easier (though I haven't tried quickstart because it
was already pretty easy ;)
 
Assuming you are running Jabber on your desktop, consider using a TCP
proxy to forward requests from one port (say 6222) to the Jabber client
port (5222).  Then direct your clients to connect to port 6222 and watch
all the XML stream back and forth.  It's a great way to familiarize
yourself with how the Jabber protocol works, as well as a great
debugging tool.
 
3) The UI is client side programming, so whatever the programmer wants
they can get.  Usually the roster display is generated from XML doled
out by the Jabber server.  The Jabber/XMPP spec says additional XML
elements can be added to the roster (read the spec to see exactly where
its OK).  An important gotcha is that different servers may not honor
these additional attributes and/or elements, and other clients may not
manipulate the additional data properly.  Quick example is the xdb_sql
modules running in the Jabber server may not save your new fields into
the Jabber database, and as such your information would be quickly lost.
The stock Jabber 1.4.2 server uses files to save XML so you may be fine
for a while. 
 
Hope this helps,
 
Mike

hi all,
 I intend to use jabber as a  transport for soap messages.I read through
the jabber protocol docs.
I've chosen to use jabberbeans to do this.But,there're several things
that i haven't been able to understand:

1.How do i rig up the basic IM client using the beans?
2.How could i test the resulting client on a lan (without using the
public jabber servers)?
3.Is it possible to have a separate indicator in the client roster UI to
mark out certain &quot;special&quot; kinds?
I'm really a novice when it comes to jabber.I have no idea how to get
started.So,any suggestion is most welcome.
Thanks a lot.
                                            Regards,
                                                     &amp;nb! sp;
