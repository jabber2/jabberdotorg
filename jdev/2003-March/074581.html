It seems that what you want is the client I wrote some time back. It
is built around a client deamon on the client side, which
authenticates the user and caches messages as they arrive. Then you
can use a set of command line tools to check messages and presence.

Among the features is the ability of the message sender to accept
messges by pipe and dynamically break the stream into multiple
messages based on size. The idea was to use jabber as a transport for
logging and such.

Unfortunately, my client uses the libs the server used for its own
stuff, which have since changed a lot (the main reason I stopped
developing it); breaking the clilent. I still have the code if you
want to hack it.
