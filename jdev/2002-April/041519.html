<PRE>That's an interesting angle ... maybe we need to work more on getting
Jabber to work well with itself, and less on getting Jabber to &quot;emulate&quot;
other protocols.  Improving client functionality and stability seems to
be the single biggest request I get from other programmers who normally
communicate on ICQ, for instance.  I think we also need to work hard on
getting Jabber onto everybody's Linux desktop: RH and Mdk would be the
two distros I'd consider most important, due to their volume.

Also, I think we should all list our JIDs as early as possible in our
contact info lists.  Having our email addresses and Jabber IDs be the
same is also good, because it gives us a measurable advantage over all
other major IM systems with the exception of MSN (although why anybody
would want to use Hotmail over Yahoo! Mail at this point is beyond me)
in terms of consistency.  (I can tell all my friends, for instance,
that they can email or Jab me at <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">dave at dave.tj</A>, or that they can email
me an instant message by sending the email to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">dave at jabber.dave.tj.</A>
Not even an MSN user can claim that.  Anybody with a Jabber server and
an SMTP server (and a piece of a brain) can do exactly the same thing,
and anybody running a reasonably recent Linux can setup a Jabber server
with no problems whatsoever, even with an almost-unsupported distro
(Slackware, in my case) and a tarball source package.)

Lastly, of course (how many people have already shouted this?),
getting ISPs to setup a tiny Linux box running a Jabber server for
their subscribers would be great, and getting users to ask their ISPs
to provide Jabber servers may be even better.

Clearly, we need to reveal the &quot;secret&quot; of Jabber, because at the moment,
Jabber really is one of the best-kept secrets - even in the open source
community itself - because people simply don't know what it actually
is :-(
