</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's an interesting angle ... maybe we need to work more on getting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber to work well with itself, and less on getting Jabber to &quot;emulate&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other protocols.  Improving client functionality and stability seems to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be the single biggest request I get from other programmers who normally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communicate on ICQ, for instance.  I think we also need to work hard on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting Jabber onto everybody's Linux desktop: RH and Mdk would be the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; two distros I'd consider most important, due to their volume.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I totally agree !
</I>You also mentioned SuSE, in another post :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I think we should all list our JIDs as early as possible in our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contact info lists.  Having our email addresses and Jabber IDs be the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same is also good, because it gives us a measurable advantage over all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other major IM systems with the exception of MSN (although why anybody
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would want to use Hotmail over Yahoo! Mail at this point is beyond me)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in terms of consistency.
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I personally don't think that a lot of people need another e-mail 
</I>&gt;<i> addres. Maybe it's better to write libraries that client developers can 
</I>&gt;<i> use to check their existing e-mail adress(es) for new e-mail. Of course 
</I>&gt;<i> you could make it a server thing and having the info through headlines. 
</I>&gt;<i> Then every client automatically would support this notification (of 
</I>&gt;<i> course if the server supports it)
</I>Nonono ... I'm not talking about getting another email address; I'm talking about using your domain (which you're probably already using for email) for Jabber too, so you can have your JID be the same as your already-existing email addy :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lastly, of course (how many people have already shouted this?),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting ISPs to setup a tiny Linux box running a Jabber server for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their subscribers would be great, and getting users to ask their ISPs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to provide Jabber servers may be even better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine how it would be if the Jabber Community could be convinced of 
</I>&gt;<i> the use of Jabber! Well, reality is different, real life example: my ISP 
</I>&gt;<i> provided a CD-Rom with some software on it, like IE and Netscape. Guess 
</I>&gt;<i> what sort of IM systems were on it? Jup, ICQ and MSN, not a byte, not 
</I>&gt;<i> even a bit was devoted to Jabber :( ...
</I>Have you tried complaining to your ISP that they don't &quot;support&quot;
Jabber, or some other type of rediculous accusation just to get their
awareness up?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course if ISPs would have a Jabber server, then I hope that they make 
</I>&gt;<i> it clear enough to the people that they actually can choose any server 
</I>&gt;<i> they want. Otherwise people will think that Jabber just is another 
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary IM system.
</I>If an ISP is willing to use Jabber, I'll say &quot;Thank you very much&quot; and
avoid picking any further.  Users will figure out whatever they want
whenever they want, but  the reality is that most users don't seem to
mind being &quot;locked in&quot; even when we're talking about _real_ proprietary
protocols (e.g. AIM, ICQ, YIM, MSNM, etc.).  You certainly won't see me
complaining about people unknowningly using an open IM system ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Clearly, we need to reveal the &quot;secret&quot; of Jabber, because at the moment,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber really is one of the best-kept secrets - even in the open source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community itself - because people simply don't know what it actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is :-(
</I>I can't stress that enough :-(
