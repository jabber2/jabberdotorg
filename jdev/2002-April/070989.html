<PRE>I agree that this is a client issue, but with that there may be exchanges between 
clients involved, say my anyJab client on Windows, Linux, Cell phone, and PDA. It 
would be nice if the user could set up a set of responses that would then propigate 
to any client in use. That would require storage of the list of responses on the 
server, or the anyJab clients being able to recongize other instances of itself on 
other platforms and directly sharing the list (again a client issue, not a server 
issue.)

I would suggest that such a list be a pull down menu, or set of buttons on the 
client interface, that is user programable, with a short list of default buttons. 
The defaut buttons would be something like Yes/No, Tell me more, Call Me. 

A client could also be programmed with direct responses based upon user presence. 
So if my presense is &quot;extended away&quot;, a friend might get a response &quot;Sorry, when I 
get back, I will reply.&quot; A family member might get &quot;I am forwarding this to my 
pager.&quot; and the message gets sent to a pager, other IM client, or Cell phone/pda.

Then again, you could build an admin bot for a server that users advise what 
thresholds to do what activities with. The admin bot could collect messages into a 
single digest for when you return, prioritizing the messages by a combination of 
urgency and timestamp, or timestamp and originator, or some other user defined rule 
set.

Admin might not be a good name for this bot, as some people would confuse it with a 
jabber administrator. Secretary-bot might be better, Bot-Assistant, perhaps even 
better.

One thing that would be nice to see with this would be the ability of that bot to e-
mail you the digest list if you are off line for more than some arbitrary lenght of 
time.

Wishfull thinking I suppose....
