<PRE>Coincidently, I *just* set up a new Theoretic Project (yeah, yet another 
one... Hey, X-Virge, don't groan! at least not in front of me :-).

I used to try and run a &quot;Win32 Jabber Client&quot; project which tried to 
design and create the ultimate Windows Jabber client. But I thankfully 
realized that hard-core coding and the Windows platform are my 
weaknesses, so I dropped it. But since I'm still interested in helping 
improve Jabber IM clients, I've re-focused, and now I'm attempting to 
create a set of usability guidelines. A set of tips and suggestions for 
client developers to make sure their client is the most easily usable 
client out there.

It is at <A HREF="http://www.theoretic.com/?Jabber_Client_Guidelines">http://www.theoretic.com/?Jabber_Client_Guidelines</A>

It is strictly for usability issues at the moment, not feature requests 
for the protocol or internal architecture. Since I have recently turned 
my entire site into a Wiki (Temas, please don't puke, it's very 
unbecoming of a distinguished programmer), anyone is free to add and 
modify things to the pages. I encourage anyone here to add points they 
think need to go there. You will find instructions near the top of every 
page. If it makes you feel any bolder in editing, know I can simply roll 
back any changes you make, so don't worry about messing up my site. I'm 
prepared for it (OK, Nick, that does *not* mean you can put p0rn up there).
