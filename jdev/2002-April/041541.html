I already do so ;-p I've have a dual boot system and I use linux most of 
the time. In linux, I use gabber, liking it a lot: I really don't need 
emoticons. Then, on the other hand, I've got my Windows friends and they 
do need those emoticons.
So I try to follow a Jabber client: Exodus. When a new release comes 
out, I even restart my computer in Windows to see how it works and then 
I post bugs and feature requests on the Exodus homepage (name: cobnet). 
When I'm done I restart again in Linux. I must say that I don't mail to 
the developer because I think they don't like it.

&gt;<i> So get your friends to try Jabber clients. If they find things they want
</I>&gt;<i> or don't like, either get them to file a wishlist bug (feature request),
</I>&gt;<i> or do so yourself. I can assure you any decent client author would
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate it :)
</I>
I already did: I convinced some people to try Winjab, Exodus and Shaolo 
and asked them what they miss in the program. It almost always came back 
to the things I wrote in my post. Sorry, but I can't e-mail all of the 
developers to say what I think. Then I thought &quot;hey, they probabably 
subscribed to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">jdev at jabber.org</A>, so I'll have them all...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The one thing I want the most is to have a good working bugfree Jabber

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* good, stable (resumable) file transfer that also works for big files

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I tried to convince some people of using Jabber and the things I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>patience to wait for &quot;my&quot; good client, but a lot of the people I tried 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to convince don't :( . They liked the idea of an open source IM-system, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>but they can't live without a good Jabber client.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What other (windows-)people like a lot is (/me does not care):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* emoticons: as much as their computer can store ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  (also see: &quot;[JDEV] Emoticons: guidelines&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>* File sharing. Although I totally dislike this feature of ICQ, people 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>find it handy to be able to transfer and share files. Personally I hate 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it when people are downloading stuff from my computer and I don't know 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>who or what. I must say that I don't know how things would be solved 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>when one client supports file sharing and the other doesn't. Does the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Jabber protocol itself supports file sharing?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
