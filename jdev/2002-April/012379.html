Yes, of course IMG tags have ALT attributes if sb doesn't want to have 
those emoticons filling their desktop. But suppose I'm is using an 
English client with some sort of click-facility to have an emoticon 
placed in the message. I send it to my sister en she's using a client 
that doesn't support emoticons. Now, that would be just fine, she can 
read the ALT attribute, if it wasn't for the fact that she doesn't 
understand English :( And English may be spoken a lot, it is still not a 
standard...
So there will be a need for some sort of standard anyway, the client 
can't keep a dictionary to translate alt=&quot;luv&quot; to e.g. liefde, but also 
alt=&quot;love&quot; to liefde or alt=&quot;lovvveu&quot; to liefde or ... (btw: liefde is 
Dutch for love).
