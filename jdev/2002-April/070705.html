<PRE>Hi,

We have been working on a context-aware mobile application
framework that handles location as well as presence information.
We use an extended version of the jabber server that can deal
with location data. The extended server handles the &lt;location&gt;
element at the same level as the common data types &lt;message&gt;,
&lt;presence&gt;, and &lt;iq&gt;; i.e. &lt;location&gt; is defined as a common data
type itself and is not part of &lt;presence&gt;. The &lt;location&gt; element
currently has a single child element, &lt;position&gt;, that indicates
the location of the user.

The framework is used to update indoor location information.
It uses an infrastructure of Bluetooth access points. The
target mobile device is, at this moment, the Compaq iPAQ
PocketPC equipped with a Bluetooth card. The instant
messaging application running on the iPAQ detects in which
Bluetooth cell it resides and sends the location information
provided by the Bluetooth access point to the extended Jabber
server. The &lt;location&gt; elements has its own subscription
mechanism, which is the same as for &lt;presence&gt;. This means
that a user can subscribe to both the presence AND the location
information of another user, as seperate items.

Currently, the framework is in the experimental phase. We use
it for our research on context-aware mobile applications and
pervasive computing. We plan to provide more details on this
project, as well as the source code for the extended server
and the mobile client application, within the coming few
months. I'll keep you posted.

I am working on a project where we have a server that is tracking users'
locations
via various technologies, and recording them in a realtime database.

I would like to be able to annotate each jabber user on the server with
some information about their physical location. This information would most
likely be
retrieved in the presence information for each user, although might there
be some better place to put it, such as a new separate iq query?

Note that the clients themselves do not necessarily know their own 
locations,
that information is derived on the server, so I need my &quot;location server&quot; to
somehow inject the location information for each user into the jabber
server, where it can be accessed by custom clients, or perhaps also stuffed
into the english-readable status strings, for backward compatibility with
existing
clients.

Anyone else working on something like this?

Thanks,
     Henry Minsky
