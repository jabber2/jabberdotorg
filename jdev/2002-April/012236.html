I totally agree !

I personally don't think that a lot of people need another e-mail 
addres. Maybe it's better to write libraries that client developers can 
use to check their existing e-mail adress(es) for new e-mail. Of course 
you could make it a server thing and having the info through headlines. 
Then every client automatically would support this notification (of 
course if the server supports it)

&gt;<i> Lastly, of course (how many people have already shouted this?),
</I>&gt;<i> getting ISPs to setup a tiny Linux box running a Jabber server for

</I>&gt;<i> to provide Jabber servers may be even better.
</I>
Imagine how it would be if the Jabber Community could be convinced of 
the use of Jabber! Well, reality is different, real life example: my ISP 
provided a CD-Rom with some software on it, like IE and Netscape. Guess 
what sort of IM systems were on it? Jup, ICQ and MSN, not a byte, not 
even a bit was devoted to Jabber :( ...

Of course if ISPs would have a Jabber server, then I hope that they make 
it clear enough to the people that they actually can choose any server 
they want. Otherwise people will think that Jabber just is another 
proprietary IM system.

&gt;<i> Clearly, we need to reveal the &quot;secret&quot; of Jabber, because at the moment,
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber really is one of the best-kept secrets - even in the open source
</I>&gt;<i> community itself - because people simply don't know what it actually
</I>&gt;<i> is :-(
