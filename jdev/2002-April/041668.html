<PRE>If I can make a suggestion:

   I would look back at the room logs for the JDEV conference room over 
the last week, where there has been many discussions on this topic 
looking at many different angles, including a whole evenings worth. Adam 
Theo (theoretic.com) has also set up a wiki page discussing this. I'm 
noticing some of your ideas are going to get slammed from other 
discussions i've been involved it, and it might be best to make sure you 
are aware of all the other things that have been said.

   My personal oppinion is that this should be client side only, with 
the client doing any of the clever manipulation, as the client knows 
what protocol the end user will be using, and I feel that transports 
should be simple routers which take a message, encapsulate it in 
whichever protocol is necessary, and send it on to the end client. If 
you want to come up with some special scheme which will work between 
jabber end clients, then fine - just don't then force this scheme onto 
messages intended for non-jabber users, as it will be the transport 
writers and maintainers who get slated with all the emails about how 
transport xyz isn't working as 'it should do' (a purely relative statement)

Regards,

   David
