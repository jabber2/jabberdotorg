</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;| (e.g. they find all those emoticons overhead). So instead of (l) (MSN

</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;People (me) who use non-graphical-smiley systems won't be bothered to
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;use colons to indicate an &quot;emoticon&quot;.  If I want emphasis, I use the
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;existing ASCII-art convention of underscores or stars.  If I want an
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;&quot;emoticon&quot; I type, eg, :-).  If it just happens to be graphical on the
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;other side, I don't care.  IOW, it's fine like it is.
</I>&gt;<i> | 
</I>&gt;<i> | I didn't mean that everything should be with words to be descriptive, 
</I>&gt;<i> | like &quot;:-)&quot; itself is descriptive enough. Indeed, I would also want as 
</I>&gt;<i> | much ASCII-art as possible. But for those other &quot;expressions&quot; (e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> | love) other things are needed and (l) (b) don't mean much to me.
</I>&gt;<i> | Suppose I'm a hardcore Windows-user and I talk to you through Jabber:
</I>&gt;<i> | 
</I>&gt;<i> | I just (e) u. I also have a (i) for your project. Maybe we could discuss 
</I>&gt;<i> | after a (~) or we could (b). I have some bad news, my (@) died, yeah, I 
</I>&gt;<i> | know: (u) .
</I>&gt;<i> | Damn, I'm tired, well, look at the (o), I'll need some (c) , no I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> | just (s) ... BTW, do not forget, it's my (^) tomorrow, hope to have good 
</I>&gt;<i> | weather so (h) Anyway, I'll (t) or (m) you tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That looks horrible.
</I>
That's why I would like it more like: &quot;I just :email: u etc.&quot;

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | Maybe, some of them you can figure out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not much other than the ones you explicitly told us.  (Actually, I
</I>&gt;<i> understand the &quot;BTW&quot; one!)
</I>
How is it possible you understand (^), (h), (t) and (m) without ever 
using MSN?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | But (supposing you never used MSN)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's me.

</I>&gt;<i> | try to write the full text without looking at e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> | <A HREF="http://communities.msn.com/Emoticons.">http://communities.msn.com/Emoticons.</A> The only thing I'm personally 
</I>&gt;<i> | afraid of is that a lot of clients will start using MSN emoticons. I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> | using Gabber myself and some friends use Exodus and a lot of the time I 
</I>&gt;<i> | have to ask what they mean with (t)(h)(i)(n)(g)(s) like this. Why 
</I>&gt;<i> | shouldn't it be done write the wright way?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;wright&quot; way (sorry, I had to) is to just write what you meant.
</I>&gt;<i> hax0rs can do all the nasty munging they want with their words, but
</I>&gt;<i> real hackers use real English (or their native tongue, if it's
</I>&gt;<i> different, and the other party also understands it).
</I>
Sorry for the &quot;wright&quot; thing ;-) , hey, but try to speak Dutch one time ;-p
If you want Jabber to be known to a lot of people, you will need the 
Windows community were a lot of people kick on using emoticons. Those 
people find it &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;necassary&quot; . If you would live in Belgium I 
would let you try to convince some of my friens of using simple native 
language text instead of those emoticons, you would probably fail...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | [...]
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;| Once again, maybe this sounds strange to you, but people really kick on 
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;| emoticons. It's like &quot;programs don't have to be usefull, they have to be 
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;| cool&quot;. I'm almost sure I can convince my sister just like that if a 
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;| client would have cool emoticons.
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;If you want to make a jabber client that does funny graphics with
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;certain text strings, go ahead.  I like eb's and gabber's non-support
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;of graphical smileys.  Exodus (a windows client) has graphical smiley
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;support, but if you're using win98 you need to fix it (windows, that
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt;is).
</I>&gt;<i> | 
</I>&gt;<i> | Sorry, for the next 2-3 months I really won't have the time. And I 
</I>&gt;<i> | personally think there are already enough Jabber clients. I know Exodus 
</I>&gt;<i> | has emoticons but they are MSN emoticons :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is &quot;:(&quot; an MSN emoticon?  I thought those were universally understood
</I>&gt;<i> and come from the days before computers could handle graphics.
</I>
Euhm, where did I say that &quot;:(&quot; is a typical MSN emoticon??

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -D
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
&quot;hax0rs can do all the nasty munging they want with their _names_, but
real hackers use _full names_&quot; ;-p you don't keep up your principles ... 
(sorry for my bad English)
