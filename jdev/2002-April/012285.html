I think it is just MSN that does that graphic junk.  I've never seen
AIM or ICQ do anything out-of-the-ordinary with emoticons.  It is just
up to the client to render &quot;:-)&quot; with a graphic, if it wants to.

</I>|<i> emoticons, you would probably fail...
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> &gt;| [...]
</I>|<i> &gt;| &gt;| Once again, maybe this sounds strange to you, but people really kick 
</I>|<i> &gt;on | &gt;| emoticons. It's like &quot;programs don't have to be usefull, they have 
</I>|<i> &gt;to be | &gt;| cool&quot;. I'm almost sure I can convince my sister just like that 
</I>|<i> &gt;if a | &gt;| client would have cool emoticons.
</I>|<i> &gt;| &gt;
</I>|<i> &gt;| &gt;If you want to make a jabber client that does funny graphics with
</I>|<i> &gt;| &gt;certain text strings, go ahead.  I like eb's and gabber's non-support
</I>|<i> &gt;| &gt;of graphical smileys.  Exodus (a windows client) has graphical smiley
</I>|<i> &gt;| &gt;support, but if you're using win98 you need to fix it (windows, that
</I>|<i> &gt;| &gt;is).
</I>|<i> &gt;| 
</I>|<i> &gt;| Sorry, for the next 2-3 months I really won't have the time. And I 
</I>|<i> &gt;| personally think there are already enough Jabber clients. I know Exodus 
</I>|<i> &gt;| has emoticons but they are MSN emoticons :(
</I>|<i> &gt;
</I>|<i> &gt;Is &quot;:(&quot; an MSN emoticon?  I thought those were universally understood
</I>|<i> &gt;and come from the days before computers could handle graphics.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> Euhm, where did I say that &quot;:(&quot; is a typical MSN emoticon??
</I>
You said (paraphrased) &quot;exodus' emoticons are msn's emoticons&quot;.
Exodus treats &quot;:(&quot;, &quot;:)&quot;, etc, as emoticons, just like the other IM
programs I've used that did any graphic rendering.  It doesn't get
'=p' though.

Hmm, now I see what you mean -- if I send (l) or (e) to exodus it
renders with a graphic.  Ugh.

|<i> &quot;hax0rs can do all the nasty munging they want with their _names_, but
</I>|<i> real hackers use _full names_&quot; ;-p you don't keep up your principles ... 
</I>
My friends gave me this name years ago, before I had heard about UNIX
and before I started programming.  Those friends are not computer
geeks at all, either.  My given name isn't very hidden anyways, google
can find it fairly easily :-).

|<i> (sorry for my bad English)
</I>
No real problem.


As long as the odd graphics and weird text mangling stays off my
screen, I don't care what else you do with them.  As you're trying to
devise a text mangling scheme for these emoticons, don't forget that
some people use IM systems to discuss coding or computer usage.  I
really hate it when AIM (where most of my friends on IM are) destroys
lines of shell commands that contain '&lt;' or '&gt;'.  At least exodus
doesn't have _that_ problem.  If someone (not me) has a coding style
of :
    j = func (i) ;
exodus and msn will be really bad for communication!

probably have no idea what it is.  If your company _is_ involved in ISO
9000 then you definitely have no idea what it is.
