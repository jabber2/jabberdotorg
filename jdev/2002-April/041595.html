<PRE>Hello,
    I have been working on a proof-of-concept module that would run
alongside the standard jabber modules c2s, s2s, xdb, dnserv,etc.

    As the time to toy with it is approaching completion, I am wondering how
to integrate it within the standard jabber architecture. I have my ideas on
the matter but I would like to hear the thought of the Jabber gods.

    The module is a would-be  server extension. I am thinking : Load it with
a tag in the configuration file such as &lt;service id=&quot;jendorfine&quot;&gt; -- and I
am now wondering what would entail to add new service types and weather this
is the right way design wise to do it. How does the delivery tree deal with
&quot;new&quot; service types ? How do you take care of making the server know that a
new message type &lt;EN/&gt; (as opposed to &lt;MESSAGE/&gt; or &lt;IQ/&gt;) is delivered to
this componenet? (and is there any documentation on the issue?).

    The function of the server module is to deliver special xml tagged files
to a new (yet another) Jabber client. The XML would be checked with a DTD on
both ends of the connection, to insure compliance to security standards, and
is defined over its own namespace.

    The XML files are static files transferred between client and server,
but I want the (my) XML stream to be encapsulated in the (jabber) XML
stream, not for my file to be transferred over another protocol as an
attachment. it has to beXML embedded in Jabber's XML.

So... the issues are: new server modles, new stream protocol top level tag
ot be directed to it.

    I have been working on my own on this for quite a while and I am trying
to finalyze my creature to finally release it publically on my CVS. I would
like to hear comments on how to integrate this application tightly with
Jabber as I would like not to make a fool of myself duplicating
functionality.... so any feedback or comment is appreciated!

    Happy Hacking - F
