Except that I could find you quite a few people who refuse to use Word 
.doc files and all sorts of other proprietary formats, even when it 
hinders the ability &quot;to communicate . . . with your friends.&quot; -- They 
find least common denominators or get their friends to use AbiWord for 
Windows or something like that. Jabber does have least common 
denominators -- you can use email or you can use the transports... there 
  *are* servers out there which run half-decent transports -- just try 
to find one run by your circle of friends or something like that.

I think you're right when you say that Open Source advocates often see 
Jabber as just an attempt to unify, not an attempt to replace. We need 
to change that viewpoint.
