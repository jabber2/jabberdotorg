<PRE>In my answers here I'll assume you are talking about a transport component 
dealing with a JID from multiple resources. These answers are my opinion 
only.

Here's a couple of the questions I'm wondering

- What is the behavior when a lower-priority resource changes presence?

The presence broadcast through the transport is always the presence of the 
resource with highest priority. If a resource with lower priority changes 
status, nothing changes on the transport side.


- What is the behavior when a lower-priority resource changes to the 
highest priority, or vice-versa? (keep in mind that some clients change 
priority when they go auto-away, and any presence change within a priority 
level makes that client have the highest priority)

Again, the primary presence broadcast should be the presence of the 
resource with highest priority.

- What is the behavior when the highest-priority resource logs out? (I'm 
assuming a lower-priority resource is ignored)

The transport looks for the resource with next-highest priority and 
transmits it's presence if it is different from the presence of the 
resource that just logged out.


- How should invisible mode interact, in both the case where the remote 
system does and does not support invisible mode?

In the case where it does support invisible:
Broadcast the presence of the resource with the highest priority.

In the case where it does not support invisible:
(this one I'm not quite sure about)
Broadcast unavailable, even if lower priorities have non-invisible status.

- What is the correct behavior when a message is sent from a resource 
which is not the highest priority?

Replies should always go to the resource from which they were sent, that 
said it is difficult to determine if something is a reply through a 
transport. Therefore I would suggest the following:

if a message from <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at jabber.org</A>/lowpriority is sent to a 
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at aim.jabber.org</A> Then a message coming from <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at aim.jabber.org</A> to 
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at jabber.org</A> would go to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at jabber.org</A>/lowpriority under the following 
conditions:
Only a small amount of time from the original message to the 'reply' has 
elapsed
<A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at jabber.org</A>/lowpriority is still available.

otherwise it would go to the resource with highest priority.

Messages coming from all other aim users to <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">bob at jabber.org</A> will go to the 
resource with highest priority.



I hope I was clear enough to understand.
