<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;I didn't mean that everything should be with words to be descriptive,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;like &quot;:-)&quot; itself is descriptive enough. Indeed, I would also want as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;much ASCII-art as possible. But for those other &quot;expressions&quot; (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;love) other things are needed and (l) (b) don't mean much to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;Suppose I'm a hardcore Windows-user and I talk to you through Jabber:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;I just (e) u. I also have a (i) for your project. Maybe we could
</I>discuss
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;after a (~) or we could (b). I have some bad news, my (@) died, yeah, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;know: (u) .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;Damn, I'm tired, well, look at the (o), I'll need some (c) , no I'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;just (s) ... BTW, do not forget, it's my (^) tomorrow, hope to have
</I>good
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;weather so (h) Anyway, I'll (t) or (m) you tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;That's awful.  If they had used [emailed] rather than (e) then it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;still be readable on textbased clients, and it wouldn't take any longer
</I>to
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;type on the graphical client, because they just select an icon from a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry to reply to my own reply, but thinking about it, I can see
</I>Mattia's
&gt;<i> &gt; point (I think)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why don't we come up with a Jabber &quot;standard&quot; list, that is text mode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; friendly, and the transports can handle the translations to annoying
</I>systems
&gt;<i> &gt; like MSN.  (Transports are cool!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, you see my point, thx! Because of the text mode friendlyness the
</I>&gt;<i> transports don't even have to handle the translations because anyone
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to understand it, they only won't see it graphically...
</I>
Sorry, I ment that the transports will have to do the translations when
messages are sent to other IM systems.  For example, if a graphical Jabber
user clicks the icon with the mouse for &quot;email&quot;, they will see the icon on
their client, and when they send it to a text only Jabber client, the other
client will see :email:, however if they send it to someone on MSN, the MSN
transport must know to translate :email: to (e) so that native MSN clients
can interpret it. (and back again when messages come from MSN to Jabber.  So
for this to be practical, we need to define a list of tags, and a lookup
table, and convince the transport authors to implement the translation.
Otherwise we are stuck with using whatever Microsoft comes up with.  You
see?

&gt;<i> Michael, you proposed [email] instead of (e), but I should take :email:
</I>&gt;<i> over [emailed]. Why? Well, I live in Belgium and I've got an azerty
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard where the &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; are in a quiet unreachable position (and
</I>&gt;<i> I need the &lt;Alt Gr&gt; key) and I think the &quot;:&quot; will be easy reachable with
</I>&gt;<i> every keyboard. Conclusion: I can type :email: much faster than [email]
</I>
That's fine by me, but I don't really understand...  I would have thought
the harder to type the better, since it is less likely to be used in normal
conversation.  If you are using a graphical client then you will not be
typing emoticons, but selecting them from a menu (is this right? - I have
never used them), and if you are the type of person that prefers to use a
text only client, the chances are you think emoticons are a stupid idea and
won't bother using them anyway.

Michael.
