<PRE>While giving general suggestions and overall opinions and such may keep
conversations going, it's not particularly productive. I think a lot of
people know that these things are needed.

If you *really* want to see Jabber clients improve, I highly suggest
filing bugs against the clients which don't do things the way you think
they should. Not only will it start get the ball rolling on conversation
(especially if you file a bug *and* post a mailing message saying &quot;hey,
I just filed this wishlist bug against client xxx because I think it
should do yyy&quot;), but it won't go away easily. As long as the bug list is
there and the client authors look at the bug list, they'll be reminded
of your request.

So get your friends to try Jabber clients. If they find things they want
or don't like, either get them to file a wishlist bug (feature request),
or do so yourself. I can assure you any decent client author would
appreciate it :)
