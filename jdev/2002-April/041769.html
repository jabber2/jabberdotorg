<PRE>Hello,

   The thing is that in order to use one of these transports, you must 
have subscribed to it, and the transport will have informed your client 
exactly which protocol it will encapsulate for. Your client, therefore, 
knows exactly which protocol the end client is using.

   In regards to another email (i'm condensing for the sake of peoples 
sanity)

* The transport is not meant to look like another jabber server, it is 
simply a transparent gateway which encapsulates the message in the 
correct protocol necessary (xml for jabber side, whatever for native 
side) and simply relays. The client knows what the protocol the end user 
is using, and thus you only need to add fancy xml tags if you are 
talking to another jabber client. There is no guesswork required.

* I don't like the argument 'well the other network doesn't handle it 
right, so why should we' - we should do better because we can, and 
because this will bring more people over to native jabber if we can 
prove we have these advantages over other protocols. If people can send 
things to us correctly, yet they can't receive the same back, which 
would you feel as a user was the better system. As for sending xml to 
msn, you wouldn't as you know that the transport you are sending through 
is for msn (from when you registered, or you can simply ask it) and thus 
you don't use xhtml or things like that.

* The jabber server does not touch the message, only some of the 
encapsulation the message is being carried in. This is completely 
different to reading and manipulating every message which passes through 
the transport - also think of the additional load on servers which have 
high-usage transports, like jabber.org

Regards,

   David

&gt;<i> XHTML is a very easy implementation, because it just treats emoticons

</I>&gt;<i> a logo standard, so :logo-IBM: should produce an IBM logo image, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> We can also have an artwork image type, where :art-picasso: would instruct
</I>&gt;<i> the receiving client to replace that text with a random Picasso painting
</I>&gt;<i> (in whatever crazy format the device happens to support).  Obviously,
</I>&gt;<i> we shouldn't stop there - having an album-cover image type is absolutely

</I>&gt;<i> we'll need a special image type for pantless people - maybe :porn: or
</I>&gt;<i> something like that?), so a client seeing :albumcover-beatles: would
</I>&gt;<i> have to dig up an image of a Beatles album cover.
