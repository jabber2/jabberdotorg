<PRE>The one thing I want the most is to have a good working bugfree Jabber 
client. Not an overfeatured one (like ICQ), but one with, next to the 
normal features:

* good, stable (resumable) file transfer that also works for big files

* good notification when a message arrives (I liked the notification of 
ICQ a lot!)

* broadcast message to a group

I tried to convince some people of using Jabber and the things I 
mentioned above were the ones that were talked most about. I have the 
patience to wait for &quot;my&quot; good client, but a lot of the people I tried 
to convince don't :( . They liked the idea of an open source IM-system, 
but they can't live without a good Jabber client.

What other (windows-)people like a lot is (/me does not care):

* emoticons: as much as their computer can store ;-)
  (also see: &quot;[JDEV] Emoticons: guidelines&quot;

* File sharing. Although I totally dislike this feature of ICQ, people 
find it handy to be able to transfer and share files. Personally I hate 
it when people are downloading stuff from my computer and I don't know 
who or what. I must say that I don't know how things would be solved 
when one client supports file sharing and the other doesn't. Does the 
Jabber protocol itself supports file sharing?


What do you think yourself?
