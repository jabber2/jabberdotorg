<PRE>Are you sure that you are authenticating properly.  I ran into a similar
problem when I first with started Jabber thinking that I had
authenticated but was actually not.  You may be smarter than I am and
are not making this mistake, but I know that I did not initially realize
it was a two step process and was confused for a little while.  I was
only sending one packet getting a successful return and thinking that I
was finished with authentication.  Nothing else worked.

You first send an iq authenticate packet of type=get and receive a
response of type=result.  This packet contains the info required for
authentication.  You then send an iq auth packet of type=set with the
username/password and you should receive a response of type=result.  You
are now authenticated.

Good luck.

Subject: [JDEV] J2me client receiving xml problem


hi all
       i have developed a j2me client similar to the one at 
alsutton's site. am using his xmlparser to parse the xml packets 
that i receive from the stream created from the connection to the 
jabber server. my problem is that after i send &lt;stream:stream....&gt; 
it gives me in reply
&lt;?xml.....&gt; after that i send the authentication xml for which i 
get the packet &lt;iq type=&quot;result&quot; id=&quot;login&quot;&gt;
once i am authenticated i send request for agents
but i receive no reply
i've tried all possible combinations of sending 
roster,agents,presence packets.....but still no reply
is there a problem with the xmlparser ?
has anyone worked with the source at alsutton.com
plz help
