<PRE>I don't think the Jabber protocol itself should define that &quot;standard&quot;
set.  Rather, we should let individual Web repositories develop, each
with its own set of emoticons.  If j.o is the first one, there will
be an incentive for any new ones to be compatible with it.  However,
there are plenty of emoticons which aren't likely to make it into the
j.o repository, and requiring clients to use a full URL for them seems
somewhat unnecessary.  I'd much rather simply include multiple SRC
attributes (or some other method of informing the receiving client of a
location where it can definitely find an appropriate image, even if the
receiving client doesn't have one in its own list of likely places (which
probably include the hard drive, followed by the client developer's Web
repository, followed by j.o, and maybe j.c, etc.), so preference can be
given to the receiving client's own images when they exist, but there
will be no need for a formal &quot;standard&quot; so _any_ emoticon can be sent,
received properly, and decoded by the receiving client in whichever way
it sees fit).
