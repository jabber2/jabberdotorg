</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - Dave
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People who are behind firewalls and proxies can upload their favorite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emoticons to GeoCities, and have their clients put in references to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And you expect normal people to this ?? (normal people as in
</I>&gt;<i> non-programmers/web devs, people like new computer users, new people to the
</I>&gt;<i> internet who just want to chat to their friends)
</I>&gt;<i> It also requires that people have their own webspace if they want to use
</I>&gt;<i> emoticons.
</I>&gt;<i> And if you mean a client should auto-upload them, then that is completely
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary complexity for something simple like emoticons.
</I>&gt;<i> All that needs to be done is standardise a standard set of emoticon codes so
</I>&gt;<i> each client will know what emoticon should be used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And what about the unneccessary bandwidth it takes up, not just in the
</I>&gt;<i> xml
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; but having to download those images,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, if you _really_ want to use whatever emoticon the recipient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already has (presumably, from his own Jabber client installation),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you can just use src=&quot;envelope.png&quot; src=&quot;mail.png&quot; along with any other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely names the graphic is likely to have, and maybe include a default
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using the filename to try and tell what emoticon is being used is completely
</I>&gt;<i> unworkable, and I dont think I have to explain why, but if anyone requires a
</I>&gt;<i> clarification feel free to email me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; src=&quot;<A HREF="http://somewhere/myenvelopeimage.png&quot;">http://somewhere/myenvelopeimage.png&quot;</A> attribute, in case the guy's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client doesn't have any such icon.  This still prevents the formation of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a &quot;standard&quot; set of emoticons for Jabber, that all clients must support,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why does it stop the formation of a standard set of emoticons ?? As long as
</I>&gt;<i> the icons that are being used represent what they are supposed to. All we
</I>&gt;<i> are trying to standardise here is a way for each client to know what each
</I>&gt;<i> emoticon code means not a single standard set of emoticon graphics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and whose interpretation (and therefore the implementation of the icons
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by different clients) is guaranteed to lack uniformity.  It also means
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that every time we add &quot;standard&quot; emoticons, clients without support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for that particular emoticon will be left in the cold.  We can always
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a &quot;reference set&quot; of emoticons at <A HREF="http://img.jabber.org/emoticons/">http://img.jabber.org/emoticons/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and have clients make hyperlinks referenced there by default, but we're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintaining the capability for anybody to send any emoticon he may want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to send, without being limited by the &quot;emoticon approval process&quot; that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; going to develop if we try to standardize emoticons directly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep there can always be a reference set of emoticon graphics for client
</I>&gt;<i> dev's to start from or use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for something like emoticons isnt it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; better just to have a way of defining that something is an emoticon and
</I>&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it represents so particular clients can display emoticons that better go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with a particular clients graphical style,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I demonstrated above that this isn't a concern if we use an HTML IMG tag
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (since if the sender wants you to use your default emoticon for something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - i.e., it's not important that you see the exact same emoticon that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; he sees when he composes the message - he can list a local (assumed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; originate on your machine) URL before the URL of his emoticon).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But again using filenames is unworkable, filenames of emoticons will
</I>&gt;<i> unlikely be always the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and also whats to stop abuse of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this by either embedding enormous images that take ages to download or
</I>&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; image with silly dimensions,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Karma stops many bad things in the Jabber world :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ....and the silly dimensions problem can be solved client-side by anybody
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who wishes to restrict the dimensions of incoming images.  I see no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason to use an infrerior solution simply because the more general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution requires a bit of protection on the part of the receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Im sorry but I think embedding a massive bit of HTML code into the message
</I>&gt;<i> everytime an emoticon is encountered is the inferior solution, that should
</I>&gt;<i> be restricted to the reason previously stated as it dramatically increases
</I>&gt;<i> the size of the xml.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; also i will cause problems where people use a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; lots of emoticons within a message,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I'm sure you will cause a lot of problems, sending too many emoticons
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within a message ;-P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> it will cause problems, you know what i meant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, naming &quot;standard&quot; emoticons doesn't lessen the load on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receiver's client's rendering engine - or even on his 'net connection,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if he doesn't store emoticons locally.  (Even a client that _does_ store
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some emoticons locally is likely to reference another repository out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the 'net, unless it decides to include some method for updating its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; local repository whenever new emoticons are &quot;standardized&quot; ... or unless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the client developer decides to use update.jabber.org to broadcast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a &quot;new&quot; version of his client every time a new emoticon is added.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As you can probably guess, the situation has the capability of getting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather silly.  I'd strongly suggest not trying to standardize within
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why does it have the capability of getting silly, and why cant a client have
</I>&gt;<i> update functionality that can include updating its emoticons as well as the
</I>&gt;<i> rest of its components ??
</I>&gt;<i> Also when did I ever suggest that naming standard emoticons lessens the load
</I>&gt;<i> on the receiver clients rendering engine??
</I>&gt;<i> All I said was that it unecessarily takes up bandwidth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jabber something which isn't even a standard outside of Jabber: let
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people go with whatever conventions they like, and the world will be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much better place.  If the ISO ever decides to standardize emoticons,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll be the first to recommend using the standard in Jabber.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Setting standards and protocols is what allows everything to communicate,
</I>&gt;<i> whats wrong with standards ??
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something like emoticons i dont think is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; best delt with by embedding it in this way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Obviously, I'd tend to disagree ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course you would, it doesnt mean you are right, emoticons are a client
</I>&gt;<i> feature and should have the ability to be turned off, which in your method
</I>&gt;<i> they cant be without turning off all embedded images, also there is no way
</I>&gt;<i> of stopping the sending person from sending them in the xml in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place, which especially in your method consumes excessive amounts of
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary bandwidth which on things such as GPRS devices is a very
</I>&gt;<i> expensive thing, and for such devices you want to use the least amount of
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth possible, also those sort of devices can currently display .png or
</I>&gt;<i> .gif, only .wbmp, should these be not allowed to use emoticons? No everyone
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to. Also what about the MSN transport, to allow emoticon
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility using your method would put much more load onto the msn
</I>&gt;<i> transport than necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This is another good enhancement but I think is better for embedding
</I>&gt;<i> images
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that are only going to be sent spairingly, like someone sending a
</I>&gt;<i> picture of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their cat or something inline in the im client, like the AIM image
</I>&gt;<i> sending
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, if we're going to need this _even if we use &quot;standadized&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emoticons_, we'll be opening this &quot;can of worms,&quot; as you put it, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We might as well avoid having the &quot;standardized&quot; emoticon system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; altogether, since it's strictly a slightly incompatible subset of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTML IMG tag approach.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I never said &quot;can of worms&quot; at all anywhere so I didnt put it like that.
</I>&gt;<i> Its not a slightly incompatible subset of the HTML IMG tag at all, your
</I>&gt;<i> particular suggestion has that solution but I dont think that by any means
</I>&gt;<i> it is the best solution, it introduces many more problems than any other
</I>&gt;<i> solutions.
