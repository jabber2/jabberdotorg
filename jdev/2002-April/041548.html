<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I didn't mean that everything should be with words to be descriptive,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like &quot;:-)&quot; itself is descriptive enough. Indeed, I would also want as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much ASCII-art as possible. But for those other &quot;expressions&quot; (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; love) other things are needed and (l) (b) don't mean much to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose I'm a hardcore Windows-user and I talk to you through Jabber:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I just (e) u. I also have a (i) for your project. Maybe we could discuss
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after a (~) or we could (b). I have some bad news, my (@) died, yeah, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know: (u) .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Damn, I'm tired, well, look at the (o), I'll need some (c) , no I'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just (s) ... BTW, do not forget, it's my (^) tomorrow, hope to have good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; weather so (h) Anyway, I'll (t) or (m) you tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's awful.  If they had used [emailed] rather than (e) then it would
</I>&gt;<i> still be readable on textbased clients, and it wouldn't take any longer to
</I>&gt;<i> type on the graphical client, because they just select an icon from a
</I>list.

Sorry to reply to my own reply, but thinking about it, I can see Mattia's
point (I think)

Why don't we come up with a Jabber &quot;standard&quot; list, that is text mode
friendly, and the transports can handle the translations to annoying systems
like MSN.  (Transports are cool!)

Michael.
