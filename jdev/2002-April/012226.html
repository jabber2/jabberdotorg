<PRE>Hey all, just wanted to update everyone on the various in-person jabber
gatherings this summer :)

JabberConf
        Munich, June 12-14
        Colorado, Aug 20-22
        <A HREF="http://jabberconf.com/">http://jabberconf.com/</A>
        Attached below is some more details from Don Bergal

O'Reilly Open Source Convention
        San Diego, July 22-26
        <A HREF="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2002/">http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2002/</A>
        <A HREF="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/3058">http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/3058</A>

As anyone who's been at any of the past gatherings knows, getting a bunch
of jabber people together is always a blast, and we tend to end up
discussing and creating lots of new jabber &quot;stuff&quot; (ideas, protocols,
code, projects, etc) at these things so if you really want to get
something up to speed fast it'll be a good opportunity to do so :)

Thanks, see ya there!

Here's the info from Don on JabberConf:

JabberConf is the chance to meet face to face with the people shaping the
future of the Jabber project and the protocol.  JabberConf takes place
twice in 2002 - Munich on June 12-14, and Keystone, Colorado on Aug 20-22.

If you are a part of the Jabber community, JabberConf is your opportunity
to influence, to participate, and to learn about the future of Jabber.
Technical topics to be covered include - SOAP on Jabber, a next generation
component protocol, Pub-Sub components, Jabber in wireless, and the Jabber
standards efforts.

This is a critical time for the Jabber project.  The number of commercial
products based on Jabber is exploding.  There are many questions that need
to be answered, however, regarding the future server development,
integration with .NET and web services, competing standards, and
interoperability.  Plans are coming together for a new, next generation
platform based on Jabber, that takes the system beyond Instant Messaging.
JabberConf is where you can take an active role in all of this.

You can register or get more details at the www.jabberconf.com page. There
is a discounted rate available through the end of April, and for open
source contributors who are not affiliated with another commercial
company, Jabber, Inc.  will consider subsidizing some of your costs. If
you have questions, go to the Jabberconf site, or contact Don Bergal at
Jabber, Inc (JID: <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">dbergal at jabber.com</A>)
