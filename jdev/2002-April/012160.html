Totally agree.  My comments really only make sense when taken as an 
illustration of why a windows/linux metaphor for icq,etc/jabber isn't 
quite right.  It's just a matter of viewpoint - and those who see Jabber 
as an IM program don't see it as meeting their needs as well as 
trillian, etc.

&gt;<i> I think you're right when you say that Open Source advocates often see 
</I>&gt;<i> Jabber as just an attempt to unify, not an attempt to replace. We need 
</I>&gt;<i> to change that viewpoint.
</I>
Also agreed.
