<PRE>My outgoing mail reformatter normally does &quot;the right thing.&quot;  I guess it's having a bad day, today :-(

Fortunately, I think I may know what's wrong ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we're going to start counting here, you can put me down for another 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one against - I don't like sending img tags in the message.  But I feel 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, so now it's 3 vs. 1 ... you'd think more people would support an
</I>&gt;<i> XML-based system for including entities in an XML protocol, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> asking clients to do complicated text processing to extract entities :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like we're going in circles here.  I don't think you need to take it as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a personal attack that others are arguing against your proposal... but 
</I>&gt;<i> I do need to take it as a personal attack.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there doesn't seem to be a lot of support for it in the messages I've 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been reading.
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, Democracy kinda sucks, eh?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I personally have the following issues with it:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) I don't like html-ish tags being stuck directly in the message tag... 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they're hard to filter out if you don't want them.
</I>&gt;<i> You simply instruct expat to ignore everything from an open html
</I>&gt;<i> tag until the corresponding close tag - a lot simpler than doing an
</I>&gt;<i> s/\b:(\w+):\b/\1/g on every incoming message.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  If you want to do 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this, do it in the xhtml tag where it is only dealt with by clients that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand images.
</I>&gt;<i> Any client that can do emoticons can do images.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) I don't like using filenames to identify an emotion.  Some picture 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that somebody thinks I want to see (maybe some nice porn) does not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessarily convey an emotion to me.
</I>&gt;<i> ...then use relative URLs for your emoticons (and consider having your
</I>&gt;<i> client treat incoming URLs as if they were relative, and only fetch the
</I>&gt;<i> remote version if you don't have a local version) :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I want to learn what an image 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means in my client.  And I want my emoticons to have the same style and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a style that matches my UI.  And I don't think sending relative paths in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the SRC attribute is a good solution to this... one client may not be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using .png files so why should it have to look for smiley.png as a key 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to display it's happyface image?
</I>&gt;<i> Your client can s/.png/.gif/ the URL if you really hate open standards ;-P
</I>&gt;<i> Rejecting an open standard (URLs) because some clients refuse to support
</I>&gt;<i> open standard image formats is throwing the baby out while leaving the
</I>&gt;<i> bath water :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the simple solution is to just leave it up to the client (with a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list of suggested emoticons to support, if desired).
</I>&gt;<i> All I can say is &quot;Yuck&quot; :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  This works fine 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; except for the weird ones that MSN uses.
</I>&gt;<i> MSN has its own problems.  If the MSN transport wants to translate
</I>&gt;<i> between XML and Microsoftese, that's its own choice, but we shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> let Microsoft make decisions about our open standards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The nicest solution I've seen is the one that allows you to define &quot;(*)&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or &quot;:star:&quot; or whatever you want as being a star emoticon (is that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really an emoticon?  no emotion there... bloody Micros*ft).  This  gives 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the following benefits:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) the MSN transport could add the appropriate tags to messages from the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MSN network so Jabber clients could translate it.
</I>&gt;<i> That approach works just fine if we treat emoticons as full-fledged
</I>&gt;<i> XML elements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Jabber clients can use the &quot;:star:&quot; instead which can still be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; translated by the MSN transport (since it knows &quot;:star:&quot; represents the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; star emoticon), can be properly displayed (by the end user's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preferences) in another graphical Jabber client, and reads in a way that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes sense for text-clients.
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, text clients are an afterthought. . .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  This also allows you to use :etoile: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead if you are speaking in french.  Yes I know it doesn't do the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; translation for a french speaker talking to an english speaker...
</I>&gt;<i> ...and in the case of non-English speakers on text clients, all they've
</I>&gt;<i> gained is these silly colons before and after words they can't understand
</I>&gt;<i> ... I believe the proper gentleman's reaction here should be somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> along the lines of &quot;This sucks!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you know what?  If it weren't for the system they would have just had to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say &quot;etoile&quot; or &quot;star&quot; in text in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> If we use real XML elements (rather than trying to encode them directly in
</I>&gt;<i> the text), their clients can do whatever they want with them (including
</I>&gt;<i> the possibility of simply displaying :etoile: or whatever, if they're
</I>&gt;<i> working with text-only clients and just can't get over those stupid
</I>&gt;<i> colons before and after the words).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  (but please let's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not use :luv: - one character saving is not enough for me to stare at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that all the time)
</I>&gt;<i> LOL. . .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Obvious disadvantage here is bandwidth usage for some clients.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really an issue of feature negotiation which needs to be resolved by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other JEPs.  Obviously if you are using an x namespace here then once a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature negotation standard is decided you can query for support of that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; namespace.
</I>&gt;<i> If we're going to define a seperate namespace for this whole
</I>&gt;<i> text-clobbering ordeal, we might as well avoid messing with the actual
</I>&gt;<i> text of the message, and use _real_ XML elements to mirror our entities
</I>&gt;<i> (emoticons, in this case).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  But we have the same issue with the double inclusion of an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;xhtml&gt; and &lt;message&gt; tag in a message... all these things need to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to be turned off if we want the protocol so be as small as possible 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for certain clients.
</I>&gt;<i> That has nothing to do with our emoticon issue, so let's avoid it here.
</I>&gt;<i> (You don't want more discussions here cluttering your inbox, do you?
</I>&gt;<i> ...so don't provoke it. . .)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope we can return to some constructive discussion.  I don't even care 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much about this issue myself, but I'm getting a little tired of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; circular conversation and &quot;you said I said 'foo' but I didn't&quot;, &quot;yes you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; did&quot;, etc.... that has been filling my mailbox from this thread.
</I>&gt;<i> LOL ... it's been filling my mailbox, too ;-P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Returning now to spectator mode.
</I>&gt;<i> ...so does that mean it's only 2 vs. 1 now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> /me likes to cheer, too ;-)
