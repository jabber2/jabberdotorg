I didn't mean that everything should be with words to be descriptive, 
like &quot;:-)&quot; itself is descriptive enough. Indeed, I would also want as 
much ASCII-art as possible. But for those other &quot;expressions&quot; (e.g. 
love) other things are needed and (l) (b) don't mean much to me.
Suppose I'm a hardcore Windows-user and I talk to you through Jabber:

I just (e) u. I also have a (i) for your project. Maybe we could discuss 
after a (~) or we could (b). I have some bad news, my (@) died, yeah, I 
know: (u) .
Damn, I'm tired, well, look at the (o), I'll need some (c) , no I'll 
just (s) ... BTW, do not forget, it's my (^) tomorrow, hope to have good 
weather so (h) Anyway, I'll (t) or (m) you tomorrow.

Maybe, some of them you can figure out. But (supposing you never used 
MSN) try to write the full text without looking at e.g. 
<A HREF="http://communities.msn.com/Emoticons.">http://communities.msn.com/Emoticons.</A> The only thing I'm personally 
afraid of is that a lot of clients will start using MSN emoticons. I'm 
using Gabber myself and some friends use Exodus and a lot of the time I 
have to ask what they mean with (t)(h)(i)(n)(g)(s) like this. Why 
shouldn't it be done write the wright way?

&gt;<i> | Once again, maybe this sounds strange to you, but people really kick on 
</I>&gt;<i> | emoticons. It's like &quot;programs don't have to be usefull, they have to be 
</I>&gt;<i> | cool&quot;. I'm almost sure I can convince my sister just like that if a 
</I>&gt;<i> | client would have cool emoticons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to make a jabber client that does funny graphics with
</I>&gt;<i> certain text strings, go ahead.  I like eb's and gabber's non-support
</I>&gt;<i> of graphical smileys.  Exodus (a windows client) has graphical smiley
</I>&gt;<i> support, but if you're using win98 you need to fix it (windows, that
</I>&gt;<i> is).
</I>
Sorry, for the next 2-3 months I really won't have the time. And I 
personally think there are already enough Jabber clients. I know Exodus 
has emoticons but they are MSN emoticons :(
