<PRE>Maybe we should consider tossing the &quot;resource&quot; system, and replacing it with a pub/sub architecture; that'll allow individual users to define the answers to all the questions below, rather than having an increasingly complex protocol dictate answers that may be somewhat less than perfectly apparent even to people as intelligent and well-versed in Jabber as Mr. Waite (obviously much less apparent to your average Joe using Jabber as a simple IM system - myself, for instance).

To the best of my knowledge, there's no requirement for JNG to be compatible with the current Jabber protocol, so we should be able to pull off the switch at this point.  In the long run, I believe we'll find that the work to overhaul the whole basic Jabber protocol will have been well worthwhile.  (In fact, I'd be willing to rewrite any part of the OSS Jabber server that nobody else wants to - I have a fair amount of free time that I spend coding my Jabber proxy server (and reading most of the Jabber and IPv6-related mailing lists) that I wouldn't mind reallocating to work on rewriting parts of jabberd, if that's what it takes to get the Jabber protocol refocused on a fundamental architecture that'll give us a tremendous amount of power in the messaging and presence management worlds, as well as a concrete base on which media delivery systems can be built with relative ease.)
