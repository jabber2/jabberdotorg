<PRE>Does it have to be in the presence info? I noticed the (unused?) XML-vCard
spec has fields for such things as a users GPS location - which is way cool,
but I don't think has ever been used.

I would love to have my client display a small map of the world with a
highlight where the user you are chatting with is (great for the geography
impaired like me!).

Perhaps your time would be better spent trying to get a consensus on a
decent implementation of the vCard or similar that all clients can use, and
just pull the info that they require, rather than loading up the presence
tags.

Just a suggestion.

Michael.

PS - the current vCard definition can be found here, but needs a lot of work
IMO.
<A HREF="http://hades.jabber.org/protocol/vcard-xml/">http://hades.jabber.org/protocol/vcard-xml/</A>

GEO tag is:

&lt;!-- Geographical position. Values are the decimal degress of LATitude and
LONgitude. The value should be specified to six decimal places.--&gt;
  &lt;!ELEMENT GEO (LAT, LON)&gt;

&gt;<i> I am working on a project where we have a server that is tracking users'
</I>&gt;<i> locations
</I>&gt;<i> via various technologies, and recording them in a realtime database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to be able to annotate each jabber user on the server with
</I>&gt;<i> some information about their physical location. This information would
</I>most
&gt;<i> likely be
</I>&gt;<i> retrieved in the presence information for each user, although might there
</I>&gt;<i> be some better place to put it, such as a new separate iq query?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the clients themselves do not necessarily know their own
</I>locations,
&gt;<i> that information is derived on the server, so I need my &quot;location server&quot;
</I>to
&gt;<i> somehow inject the location information for each user into the jabber
</I>&gt;<i> server, where it can be accessed by custom clients, or perhaps also
</I>stuffed
&gt;<i> into the english-readable status strings, for backward compatibility with
</I>&gt;<i> existing
</I>&gt;<i> clients.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone else working on something like this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Henry Minsky
