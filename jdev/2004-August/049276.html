It's all in how you use it. I'm still trying to grapple Qt's object model.

</I>
That's actually a really good idea. Something that an automated script could
do in say Python. You would need a compliant library, but it could be done.
The list of tests would have to be enumerated. Registering, logging out,
logging in, breaking the connection, sending a message, receiving a
message, deleting the account, etc. The list will be quite long, and don't
forget s2s too.

If all that needs to be done is run a script giving it a jabber server to
use, and it spits out a test report (50% compliant, these tests failed,
etc.). I don't see why that wouldn't be a good thing for the community.
Community involvement will have to be necessary to ensure any possible test
case gets added to the main suite.

Testing client compliance would be a little trickier. It would have to be
tested against a compliant server with some way of checking what it sends.

&gt;<i> Yeah, I know, I tried this once before, to push for various Jabber

</I>
Server certifications could be automated like I suggested above. Components
probably can be too. It might be possible with clients. Client libraries
will probably already have their own tests, but clients meant for human use
probably would need some human interaction to be certified. Realistically
server certification could be realized first. Client certifications would
require some money. Certifying clients could prove to be a decent income
stream for someone. The JSF would benefit too since the Jabber trademark
would most likely want to be licensed.

&gt;<i> I really do still think being able to standardize, both on what
</I>&gt;<i> features are supported for various levels of certification, and for how
</I>&gt;<i> rigidly those implementations adhere to specification, would be of
</I>&gt;<i> immense value.
</I>
JEP-0073 and JEP-0117 already define a couple of levels. They would be a
start.

Add in my 2 cents. Total: $0.04
