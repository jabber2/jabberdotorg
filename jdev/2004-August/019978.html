Someone can sponsor me. It'll keep me from having to find a job. :-)

I'm already thinking about putting some effort into one of the servers, most
likely jabberd 2, once I'm done with my current obligation of MUCing with
Psi. One of the things I want to do is make use of Jabber as message
oriented middleware to distribute data around. It's already got the
routing, but problems remain.

When I got my initial idea to use Jabber, I was expecting most of the Jabber
puzzle to be complete. After getting involved with the community, some
problems have been pointed out to me. As it stands I may have my work cut
out for me to have something that has the reliability for what I want to
use it for.
 
I did come across WPJabber which seems to be a fork of jabberd 1.4. That's a
good thing. I don't know if it's up to XMPP 1.0 or not, but I was glad to
see that someone took it up.

Python is very easy to learn. I went through its tutorial in about a day,
and its interactive shell helps a ton. Though being able to learn a
language quickly doesn't equate into wisdom which results into easy to read
and maintain code. Writing code is more than just writing code. You still
need to think things through and come up with a decent design too.

It doesn't take a chef to make spaghetti. 

Jumping into a foreign program also takes time. It would probably take the
same amount of time to figure out a Python program as a decent C or C++
program. Knowing how A connects to B which connects to C etc. is only half
of the battle to making changes.

Not to drench the end of this with gasoline. Yes, C is prone to memory leaks
and bugs from misuse. That's why they made C++. :-)

(though abstracting could solve some of those problems)
