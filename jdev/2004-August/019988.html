</I>&gt;<i> Yesterday I was busy hacking away at Psi implementing MUC support. One of
</I>&gt;<i> the things I was working on was arranging occupants by their role in the
</I>&gt;<i> room. One of the tests I needed to do was change an occupant's role to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure that the list item got placed under the correct role. Since I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> got to the functionality of doing that within Psi, I decided to paste in
</I>&gt;<i> and change one of the examples from JEP-0045 into my XML console.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To my surprise I ran into a limitation of mu-conference 0.6.0. It lacks
</I>&gt;<i> support for changing roles! When I sent an &lt;iq/&gt; based off of JEP-0045's
</I>&gt;<i> example 104, I got an &lt;iq/&gt; back with its type set to &quot;error&quot;. I tried some
</I>&gt;<i> other examples and got the same thing. I figured mu-conference would
</I>&gt;<i> support most of JEP-0045. I guess not.
</I>
As I found out through trial and error, mu-conference will not accept 
whitespace in the XML you send to it. I've submitted a bug report on 
this behavior.

&gt;<i> All we need is ONE solid, compliant server and solid, compliant components
</I>&gt;<i> to complement it. By solid I mean stable, bug free, and completely there
</I>&gt;<i> with no surprises. If it were a physical object, you could shake it and not
</I>&gt;<i> hear anything bouncing around in side. By compliant, I mean that it follows
</I>&gt;<i> XMPP-Core, XMPP-IM, and any JEPs to a 'T'.
</I>
I've been talking about this for a while at my weblog [1] and have been 
working behind the scenes to make this happen. If all goes well, look 
for a more formal proposal soon.
