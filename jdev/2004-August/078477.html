</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Of course, I'm very interested in MSN-t with Twisted. Perhaps that

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think twisted would be a lot easier to work with than the GAIM plugins.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a framework for creating networked applications that may use multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols. <A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com">http://www.twistedmatrix.com</A> for more info.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be possible to somehow build the GAIM plugins into Twisted? I
</I>&gt;<i> know that Twisted has support for lots of protocols, but the closed IM
</I>&gt;<i> protocols are not on that list AFAIK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /psa

It would probably be possible to build the GAIM plugins into twisted, but it 
would be messy, and that's what I'm trying to avoid =P
Twisted has support for the Oscar, MSN, IRC and Jabber IM protocols. It also 
has support for lots of others, like pop3, smtp, etc (maybe for later on =))

Right now I have the new transport working. It shouldn't be too hard to adapt 
for AOL/ICQ, all the legacy protocol code is in one directory, so that can be 
swapped out. I've still got a few critical things. Disco/Browse/Agents (think 
it's still worth supporting the last two?), as well as in band registration 
and groupchat.

Oh yeah, I wanted to ask. Has anybody got any good ideas for a better way to 
do Jabber&lt;-&gt;MSN groupchat? The MSN protocol makes no separation between 
groupchats and ordinary chats, and extra people can be invited into a room at 
any time. So the only way I can think of handling it is..
* MSN contact invites a new person into the room.
* MSN-t notices, converts the room to a conference and sends Jabber user an 
invite to the virtual conference room
* Jabber joins the conference and receives any buffered events with 
jabber:x:delay
* If the Jabber user doesn't join the conference within (maybe 3 minutes?) 
then they get a message from the transport with a transcript of the 
conference room so far, and they leave the conference on the MSN side.

Any objections/suggestions?

For starting an MSN groupchat on the jabber side, just join any random room on 
conference.msn.host.com and invite your msn contacts to it.
