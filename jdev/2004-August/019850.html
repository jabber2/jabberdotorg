<PRE>Hi,
Some time ago (about a year), I had the same idea: build a transport 
framework where GAIM plugins could plug in.
I started inspecting the GAIM code, and to say the truth, it is not well 
written for server development, in the sense that user interface 
elements and &quot;protocols&quot; interact very deeply.
Also the plugin abstraction layer looks not so much &quot;independent&quot; from 
the undelying protocol (if I remember well, every protocol is mapped on 
the original interface written for AIM).
To make the whole thing working you:
- should be a very carismatic person so to convince GAIM developers to 
re-ingegnerize their code for sake of jabber.
- actively partecipate to their mailing lists, so to point their efforts 
to common goals
Also the JSF (== the sponsoring companies) could give some money to the 
developers (you (?) and the main GAIM developers) in the form of prize 
for the work done.

In the past, I looked at an efficient way to assure transport 
development and fixing but, at this time, I did not find a good solution 
for several reasons:
- most transport are one-man-projects written in spare time for their 
own delight
- you need a very good programmer to write transports, but good 
programmers often become afraid to deal always with the same tediuos job 
of looking at the mailing-lists about the protocols.
- from an economic point of view, if a company has a programmer so 
skilled to do transport maintainance, it is better to &quot;invest&quot; him in 
some more lucrous activities (for the company)
- form a legal point of view, transport develoment is not &quot;clearly&quot; legal.
- at last, I think end users did think transports so appealing as in the 
past either because computers are becoming more and more powerful (so 
taking 4-5 IM clients open does not waste resources), or because now all 
the major players (but Microsoft) have the &quot;original&quot; client available 
for most OS.

</I>&gt;<i>     - There might be less code in the transport, and less code is easier

&gt;<i>

&gt;<i>       the equivalent Jabber transport.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the general gist is &quot;less long-term development time&quot;, the idea here

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantages?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - Possible memory consumption issues.  GAIM can run multiple

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - Any other disadvantages?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be interested to hear people's ideas on this, or whether someone

&gt;<i> it's probably consuming more time than it should, and is detracting from
