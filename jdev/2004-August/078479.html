That already sounds infinitely better than what we currently have. :-)

Does the MSN protocol really give the user no way to reject an invite?  I 
always thought it was odd that an MSN user was able to get me into a 
conference even if I didn't want to be there.  I always figured it would be 
better if it sent an invite, and only joined me to the real conference when I 
joined to the transported one. :-/
