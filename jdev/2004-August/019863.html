&gt;<i>Dear Frank,

</I>&gt;<i>I personally think it would have been more responsible and prudent for you

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Mr. Sebastiaan Deckers and Mr. Dries Staelens, are both illegally

</I>&gt;<i>regret this unfortunate turn of events and any inconvenience which it may

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Please know that as we become aware of anyone using any software as acquired
</I>&gt;<i>through Mr. Deckers or Mr. Staelens, we will serve notice, and if our notice
</I>&gt;<i>is ignored, we are prepared to take all necessary actions to enforce our

</I>&gt;<i>you contact us at <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">info at rhymbox.com</A> or <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">info at pandion.biz</A> so as to acquire a
</I>&gt;<i>legal license. This will indemnify you from any legal actions on the part of
</I>&gt;<i>RhymBox, LLC. There is no charge for a non-exclusive personal usage license
</I>&gt;<i>at this time, rather we simply want to monitor our intellectual property.
</I>&gt;<i>Any fees in relation to re-brandings or commercial licenses, should be paid

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>On a more personal note, I would like to respond to Mr. Deckers'
</I>&gt;<i>unprofessional and ludicrous &quot;Open Letter&quot;. Mr. Deckers personally and
</I>&gt;<i>libelously attacked my wife, making obscene acqusations and taking a
</I>&gt;<i>business matter to a very improper personal level. Let Mr. Deckers' actions
</I>&gt;<i>serve as warning to anyone who wishes to engage him for the purpose of doing
</I>&gt;<i>business, now or in the future. Rather than confront me in accordance with
</I>&gt;<i>our agreement, he has chosen to attack my wife. Mr. Deckers' actions are
</I>&gt;<i>nothing short of a pathetic coward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Be that as it may, I regret the unfortunate circumstances upon which I have
</I>&gt;<i>made your acquintance. Perhaps you can keep an open mind and understand that
</I>&gt;<i>while Mr. Deckers and Mr. Staelens are contributing programmers to
</I>&gt;<i>RhymBox/Pandion, they are not the owners.

</I>&gt;<i>We will be providing more information as our legal proceedings continue. We

</I>&gt;<i>Subject: [jadmin] Rhymbox coup d'&#233;tat? Recommend everyone avoid
</I>&gt;<i>Rhymbox.com
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>[Apologies in advance if cross posting is in error.  As the issue
</I>&gt;<i>relates to users, developers, and admins alike, I thought it best to
</I>&gt;<i>post to JADMIN, JDEV, and JUSER.  If in error, please forgive me.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>At this time, I would like to renounce my support for any new
</I>&gt;<i>versions of the Windows Jabber client Rhymbox as it is shown on the
</I>&gt;<i>website www.rhymbox.com.  Please note any previous posts from myself
</I>&gt;<i>regarding this software are in relation to Rhymbox v1.6, which was
</I>&gt;<i>released in May 2003, and do not carry over to its current state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is a long email, but the short version is that something unholy is
</I>&gt;<i>afoot in the Rhymbox family.  I would recommend everyone avoid visiting
</I>&gt;<i>the website, signing up for any new release, or using any new releases
</I>&gt;<i>posted there, as it appears some kind of coup d'&#233;tat has occurred.
</I>&gt;<i>Either one of the two original developers is revolting, or those
</I>&gt;<i>currently running the site and its matching Jabber server have, in fact,
</I>&gt;<i>hijacked them.  The website in question may or may not represent the
</I>&gt;<i>true Rhymbox software team, and until all parties weigh in somewhere in
</I>&gt;<i>a truly open forum (such as the Jabber mailing lists), I would recommend
</I>&gt;<i>that anything you read on the site be taken with a grain of salt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Now allow me to explain.  One of the many sites I monitor is the Rhymbox
</I>&gt;<i>website.  I have been using the Rhymbox software since v1.5, have used
</I>&gt;<i>v1.6 since May 2003 without issue, and I have been hoping to see a new
</I>&gt;<i>release with advanced support for XMPP, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yesterday morning I noted that the website had changed.  I looked, and
</I>&gt;<i>lo and behold it appeared a v2.0 was on its way.  The main page
</I>&gt;<i>indicated that people could sign up for an early release of v2.0.  I
</I>&gt;<i>decided to check the support forums to see if there was any more
</I>&gt;<i>information regarding this upcoming release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The first thing I noticed is that the support forum no longer runs on
</I>&gt;<i>ezBoard.com, but rather now was using phpBB.  So I thought, &quot;Great.
</I>&gt;<i>They're updating their site, changing their support forums in
</I>&gt;<i>preparation for a new release.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>However, I also noticed that all the old postings were gone.  No feature
</I>&gt;<i>requests, and no history of problems &amp; solutions.  I figured this was an
</I>&gt;<i>unfortunate side effect to changing forum software.  There was a few
</I>&gt;<i>posts in the Problems &amp; Solutions section, and I decided to check them out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It was here that it became clear that something was wrong.  One of the
</I>&gt;<i>posts read 'Open Letter to the RhymBox Community', apparently written by
</I>&gt;<i>one of the 2 authors of Rhymbox as listed in the 'About...' box in the
</I>&gt;<i>software itself.  Reading his post, it became clear something was
</I>&gt;<i>wrong.  Instead of paraphrasing, I am attaching the HTML version of that
</I>&gt;<i>page (Rhymbox_issue-stripped.html), which luckily I saved at the time so
</I>&gt;<i>I could do some copy/pasting with ease.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I posted my own message to the forum, and less than 12 hours later,
</I>&gt;<i>found the entire forum had been wiped clean again.  I reposted, asking
</I>&gt;<i>for clarification of what was going on.  My repost I also attach here
</I>&gt;<i>so as not to paraphrase (Rhymbox Support email.txt).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Please note that today I found the forum had been wiped clean yet again,
</I>&gt;<i>and I received a private email from <A HREF="http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jdev">info at rhymbox.com</A> titled &quot;Your
</I>&gt;<i>concerns&quot;, attached here as well (Rhymboxfinal.txt).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Now my personal opinion on the matter.  The 'official' response from the
</I>&gt;<i>Rhymbox website basically says nothing of substance, and their actions
</I>&gt;<i>of basically censoring their users seriously makes me believe the open
</I>&gt;<i>letter's validity.  (They never did this in the past...I had several
</I>&gt;<i>posts in their forums over the past year)   I have also emailed
</I>&gt;<i>Sebastiaan Deckers at the email he provided in the open letter, and
</I>&gt;<i>Sebastiaan actually telephoned me.  I have no reason to believe this was
</I>&gt;<i>anyone other than who he said, and our conversation was consistent with
</I>&gt;<i>the open letter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have no idea what the legal situation is, nor will I pretend to be
</I>&gt;<i>such an authority.  However, it seems painfully clear that something
</I>&gt;<i>unhealthy is occurring with Rhymbox.com.  This is extremely unfortunate,
</I>&gt;<i>as the software has worked well for us in the past year, and I was
</I>&gt;<i>looking forward to a new release.  I suspect we will see a new release
</I>&gt;<i>by the author(s) under a different name, and I would recommend anyone
</I>&gt;<i>out there currently using Rhymbox or contemplating doing so stick to
</I>&gt;<i>v1.6 until the authors indicate that they have a new program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks to all who read this far.
