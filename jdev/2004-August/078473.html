There are solutions, yes. But personally I don't see this as a major 
problem right now -- we seem to be usually talking about edge cases 
rather than use cases that are central to building out XMPP. Others are 
of course welcome to work on this, but I'm not going to spend a lot of 
cycles on it until I see some powerful use cases.
