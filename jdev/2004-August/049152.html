Justin,

Most, if not all, of us are very familiar with the fact that
Sebastiaan and Dries wrote and originally distributed Rhymbox (now
Pandion) beginning almost 3 years ago and that some shenanigans with
you evidently transpired over the last year which resulted in them
losing control of the Rhymbox.com domain.

For those needing a refresher, please see the details at:
<A HREF="http://forums.pandion.be/viewtopic.php?t=3">http://forums.pandion.be/viewtopic.php?t=3</A>

You see, their development efforts and commitment to the Jabber
community are chronicled in the JUSER/JDEV/JADMIN lists over the past
few years and many of us have worked with them to help make Rhymbox
(now Pandion) a very innovative Jabber client.

You, however, appear from nowhere to the Jabber community supposedly
holding US legal paperwork for the Rhymbox name/domain.
Congratulations on your successful manipulation of the situation! I'm
sure these two friendly young European open source developers were no
match for your knowledge of the US legal system!

Sebastiaan and Dries are working on the current Pandion code base at
<A HREF="http://www.pandion.be">http://www.pandion.be</A> (and pandion.biz has nothing to do with their
efforts). Their support forums are still very active and their efforts
are still underway. The community will continue to support them there,
as it was their ideas and hard work that produced the client that
exists today.

Justin: good luck with your new snatch-a-brand business, but I doubt
you'll have much success finding support from this community as long
as the real history of your &quot;product&quot; is recorded and available for
all to see in our list archives.

-Paul
