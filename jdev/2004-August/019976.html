<PRE>I agree that using Python would at least make it easier to have something 
stable and bugfree.  However, two questions come to mind:

1) Would it be easier to sponsor rob to complete jabberd2 rather than sponsor 
a new project with new and/or possibly inexperienced developers?  I have a 
feeling that if someone wanted to make a Python server they would have done 
so already, and if they have not, then it would be due to time constraints 
(I'm thinking of Jacek, author of pyxmpp).  Unless we're flinging $$$ around, 
I don't see the situation changing, and if we are, then we need to evaluate 
our options.

2) As I understand, Python has some really nice facilities for doing network 
and server programming (particularly with Twisted).  However, is Python very 
well suited for client /GUI/ development?  This is not a flame, but a 
legitimate question.  If the idea is to make a slick client for the average 
user, that can run under Windows, Python's ability to deliver is an important 
factor.  Are there notable Python GUI apps?  How mature is the concept?  Do 
we want to be a pioneer on two fronts (Jabber and Python) ?

</I>&gt;<i> time required just to get an idea on how the old C transports work :-).
</I>&gt;<i> And don't forget that with Python (or, in fact, any other decent framework
