<PRE>I posted a query with regard to wpjabber-1.1.2 and XDB_LDAP last week.
In the mean time I got XDB_LDAP basically running (ns: auth, users),
however I had to add sychronization code (critical sections) in key
places in the c code.  

Should I be worried about the thread worthiness of some of the other
loaded shared objects which have a jabber-1.4.2 lineage?  It appears
that a single WPJabber server does synchronize calls to XDB_LDAP,
however if I spin up a client which has rosters members on multiple
Jabber servers concurrency issues occurred which caused a fatal
exception in the Jabber server (via XDB_LDAP) w/o the semaphore
locking/unlocking code.
