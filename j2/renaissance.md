# Jabber.org Renaissance

Version 0.3, 2020-01-19

## Vision

We intend for Jabber.org to be the foundation of a large scale federated network for private personal messaging.

## Strategy

By the end of 2020, create a cohesive team, self-sustaining non-profit foundation, easy-to-deploy federation, and highly usable interface for personal communication that will never compromise privacy.

## Goals

### Team

The foundation for achieving our vision is not an organizational structure or a technological platform, but our team. It is all-important that we build a cohesive team with high trust, candid communication, commitment to common goals and values, accountability to each other and our users, and a drive for results.

### Organization

Since 1999, Jabber.org has been a completely volunteer effort that has depended on the kindness of friends (such as USSHC for hosting and more recently Isode for software and a server donation). The service needs to become self-sustaining financially and organizationally, yet with an appropriate incentive structure for team members to contribute their time and energy (most likely as a non-profit foundation).

### Federation

Our primary offering is a Raspberry Pi based private communication service designed to run seamlessly at home to support personal messaging for family, friends, and the local community.

### Interface

The usability and privacy of Jabber/XMPP software applications and services is simply not good enough. We have an opportunity and responsibility to vastly improve the user experience and security. We will do so by sponsoring work on existing software and by creating our own apps especially where coverage is weak.

## Values

### Pragmatic Idealism

We are pragmatic idealists who strive to efficiently produce usable software applications and provide infrastructure for federated services.

### Privacy and Security

We feel a strong moral obligation to provide software and services that deeply respect the privacy and security of personal communications.

### Integrity

We act with integrity and respect for our users by interacting in a humane way (e.g., by communicating as a team of individuals and not as a faceless corporation). We also strive to protect the integrity of federated services and apps we support by never compromising on their privacy and security.

## Transparency

We are committed to transparency in all aspects of our operation:

- Open Standards: We use XMPP technologies as the basis for our platform. If needed to provide features that our users desire, we will define additional open standards, typically as extensions to XMPP.
- Open Source: We use liberally-licensed (e.g., MIT/BSD) software code that is open to inspection and easy to understand.
- Open Deployment: We document how we build and deploy our software to further increase confidence and trust in our service.
- Open Management: We regularly provide insights into decisions that our team makes regarding technology and organization, and we encourage and listen to community input on these topics.
- Open Books: We disclose all financial aspects of our operation.

## Projects & High-Level Tasks

### Build the Team

- define a competency model to help us add the right people to the team
- define roles and job descriptions to improve clarity
- recruit 3-5 core team members

### Create the Organization

- decide on organizational form and legal status
- establish bank account
- obtain seed funding (on the order of $50,000)
- legally establish the organization
- define founding documents (charter, articles of incorporation, and bylaws) and obtain legal review
- set up system for receiving donations
- determine whether to seek larger grants and organizational donations

### Solidify the Service

- migrate to Prosody or other open-source server code
- re-open user registration
- encrypt all data at rest (user credentials, rosters, message archives)
- define and deploy methods for supporting end users
- define and deploy initial anti-spam measures (e.g., a reputation system)
- define and deploy initial attack protections (e.g., against DDoS botnets)

### Make it Usable

- create user-friendly onboarding experience and documentation
- create a list of existing end-user apps to recommend
- create a rank-ordered list of supported end-user platforms
- seek out usability expertise and contract for usability testing
- create project plans for improving existing apps
- create project plans for building any new apps

### Scale it Up

- define metrics for success (e.g., number of registered users, number of simultaneous users, sign-ups per week, connected servers, media mentions)
- define audiences to which weâ€™d like to promote the service
- promote the service
- measure the effectiveness of promotional efforts and continually improve them
